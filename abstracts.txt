ABSTRACT: Topological photonics seeks to control the behaviour of the light through the design of protected topological modes in photonic structures. While this approach originated from studying the behaviour of electrons in solid-state materials, it has since blossomed into a field that is at the very forefront of the search for new topological types of matter. This can have real implications for future technologies by harnessing the robustness of topological photonics for applications in photonics devices. This roadmap surveys some of the main emerging areas of research within topological photonics, with a special attention to questions in fundamental science, which photonics is in an ideal position to address. Each section provides an overview of the current and future challenges within a part of the field, highlighting the most exciting opportunities for future research and developments.

ABSTRACT: The field of topological photonics has seen tremendous and wide-ranging developments in recent years. Evolving from the broader field of topological insulators, topological photonics systems today harness a variety topological phases. These include the Su-Schreifer-Heeger, quantum Hall, quantum valley Hall and quantum spin Hall topologies. Importantly, the latter two generate edge states with opposite group velocities and opposite spin, respectively, allowing unidirectional light propagation and advanced photonic routing to occur. Amongst these exciting developments is a subset of advancements made in topological silicon photonics, which could potentially lend its appeal to complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) photonics applications, including telecommunications, data communications, quantum photonics, future exascale supercomputers, photonic neuromorphic computing, and infrared sensing. The fundamental underpinnings of these topological phases lead to interesting features, including chirality, scatter-free light propagation around sharp bends, and importantly topological protection against defects, disorder, and scattering. This topological protection may be harnessed toward tunable light propagation, photon-pair generation, quantum spatial entanglement, robust photonic routing, and beyond. Herein, the recent advancements made in the burgeoning field of topological silicon photonics are discussed.

ABSTRACT: Quantum topological photonics is a new research field with great potential that is based on developments in both quantum optics and topological photonics. Topological photonics offers unique properties, including topological robustness and an anti-backscattering property, and these advantages are strongly required in quantum optics. Quantum technology, which includes quantum optics, represents an important direction for future technological development. However, existing quantum light sources are unstable and quantum information may easily be lost during transmission. These disadvantages have troubled researchers for a long time and no perfect solution is available thus far. Fortunately, application of topological photonics to quantum optics can help to generate robust quantum light sources and protect photons from decoherence during photon propagation. This allows the correlation and entanglement to be maintained even when photons travel over long distances. To date, quantum topological photonics has provided major breakthroughs in certain quantum devices. This Review presents the basic concepts of quantum topological photonics and summarizes how the topological protection property works in quantum light sources, quantum information transmission, and other quantum devices. Finally, an outlook is provided on the remaining challenges and potential future directions of quantum topological photonics, which can aid in exploration of additional new phenomena.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics provides a powerful framework to describe and understand many nontrivial wave phenomena in complex electromagnetic platforms. The topological index of a physical system is an abstract global property that depends on the family of operators that describes the propagation of Bloch waves. Here, we highlight that there is a profound geometrical connection between topological physics and the topological theory of mathematical surfaces. We show that topological band theory can be understood as a generalization of the topological theory of surfaces and that the genus of a surface can be regarded as a Chern number of a suitable operator defined over the surface. We point out some nontrivial implications of topology in the context of radiation problems and discuss why for physical problems the topological index is often associated with a bulk-edge correspondence.

ABSTRACT: The study of topological phases of light suggests novel opportunities for creating robust optical structures and on-chip photonic devices which are immune against scattering losses and structural disorder. However, many recent demonstrations of topological effects in optics use structures with relatively large scales. Here, the physics and realization of topological photonics on small scales, with the dimensions often smaller or comparable with the wavelength of light, are discussed. The recent experimental demonstrations of small-scale topological states based on arrays of resonant nanoparticles are highlighted and a novel photonic platform using higher-order topological effects for creating subwavelength highly efficient topologically protected optical cavities is discussed. Special attention is paid to the recent progress on topological polaritonic structures and the paper concludes with the vision on the future directions of nanoscale topological photonics and its impact on other fields.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics emerged as a novel route to engineer the flow of light. Topologically protected photonic edge modes, which are supported at the perimeters of topologically nontrivial insulating bulk structures, are of particular interest as they may enable low-loss optical waveguides immune to structural disorder. Very recently, there has been a sharp rise of interest in introducing gain materials into such topological photonic structures, primarily aiming at revolutionizing semiconductor lasers with the aid of physical mechanisms existing in topological physics. Examples of remarkable realizations are topological lasers with unidirectional light output under time-reversal symmetry breaking and topologically protected polariton and micro/nanocavity lasers. Moreover, the introduction of gain and loss provides a fascinating playground to explore novel topological phases, which are in close relevance to non-Hermitian and parity-time symmetric quantum physics and are, in general, difficult to access using fermionic condensed matter systems. Here, we review the cutting-edge research on active topological photonics, in which optical gain plays a pivotal role. We discuss recent realizations of topological lasers of various kinds, together with the underlying physics explaining the emergence of topological edge modes. In such demonstrations, the optical modes of the topological lasers are determined by the dielectric structures and support lasing oscillation with the help of optical gain. We also address recent research on topological photonic systems in which gain and loss, themselves, essentially influence topological properties of the bulk systems. We believe that active topological photonics provides powerful means to advance micro/nanophotonics systems for diverse applications and topological physics, itself, as well.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics has emerged as a promising field in photonics that is able to shape the science and technology of light. As a significant degree of freedom, valley is introduced to design and construct photonic topological phases, with encouraging recent progress in applications ranging from on-chip communications to terahertz lasers. Herein, the development of topological valley photonics is reviewed, from both perspectives of fundamental physics and practical applications. The unique valley-contrasting physics determines that the bulk topology and the bulk-boundary correspondence in valley photonic topological phases exhibit different properties from other photonic topological phases. Valley conservation allows not only robust propagation of light through sharp corners, but also 100% out-coupling of topological states to the surrounding environment. Finally, robust valley transport requires no magnetic materials or the complex construction of photonic pseudospin and, thus, can be integrated on compact photonic platforms for future technologies.

ABSTRACT: Topological phases of matter are an exotic phenomenon in modern condensed matter physics, which has attracted much attention due to the unique boundary states and transport properties. Recently, this topological concept in electronic materials has been exploited in many other fields of physics. Motivated by designing and controlling the behavior of electromagnetic waves in optical, microwave, and sound frequencies, topological photonics emerges as a rapid growing research field. Due to the flexibility and diversity of superconducting quantum circuits system, it is a promising platform to realize exotic topological phases of matter and to probe and explore topologically-protected effects in new ways. Here, theoretical and experimental advances of topological photonics on superconducting quantum circuits-via the experimentally demonstrated parametric tunable coupling techniques, including using of the superconducting transmission line resonator, superconducting qubits, and their coupled system-are reviewed. On superconducting circuits, the flexible interactions and intrinsic nonlinearity make topological photonics in this system not only a simple photonic analog of topological effects for novel devices, but also a realm of exotic but less-explored fundamental physics.

ABSTRACT: Recently, the study of topological structures in photonics has garnered significant interest, as these systems can realize robust, nonreciprocal chiral edge states and cavity-like confined states that have applications in both linear and nonlinear devices. However, current band theoretic approaches to understanding topology in photonic systems yield fundamental limitations on the classes of structures that can be studied. Here, we develop a theoretical framework for assessing a photonic structure's topology directly from its effective Hamiltonian and position operators, as expressed in real space, and without the need to calculate the system's Bloch eigenstates or band structure. Using this framework, we show that nontrivial topology, and associated boundary-localized chiral resonances, can manifest in photonic crystals with broken time-reversal symmetry that lack a complete band gap, a result that may have implications for new topological laser designs. Finally, we use our operator-based framework to develop a novel class of invariants for topology stemming from a system's crystalline symmetries, which allows for the prediction of robust localized states for creating waveguides and cavities.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics is a rapidly emerging field of research in which geometrical and topological ideas are exploited to design and control the behavior of light. Drawing inspiration from the discovery of the quantum Hall effects and topological insulators in condensed matter, recent advances have shown how to engineer analogous effects also for photons, leading to remarkable phenomena such as the robust unidirectional propagation of light, which hold great promise for applications. Thanks to the flexibility and diversity of photonics systems, this field is also opening up new opportunities to realize exotic topological models and to probe and exploit topological effects in new ways. This article reviews experimental and theoretical developments in topological photonics across a wide range of experimental platforms, including photonic crystals, waveguides, metamaterials, cavities, optomechanics, silicon photonics, and circuit QED. A discussion of how changing the dimensionality and symmetries of photonics systems has allowed for the realization of different topological phases is offered, and progress in understanding the interplay of topology with non-Hermitian effects, such as dissipation, is reviewed. As an exciting perspective, topological photonics can be combined with optical nonlinearities, leading toward new collective phenomena and novel strongly correlated states of light, such as an analog of the fractional quantum Hall effect.

ABSTRACT: Liquid crystals are complex fluids that allow exquisite control of light propagation thanks to their orientational order and optical anisotropy. Inspired by recent advances in liquid-crystal photo-patterning technology, we propose a soft-matter platform for assembling topological photonic materials that holds promise for protected unidirectional waveguides, sensors, and lasers. Crucial to our approach is to use spatial variations in the orientation of the nematic liquid-crystal molecules to emulate the time modulations needed in a so-called Floquet topological insulator. The varying orientation of the nematic director introduces a geometric phase that rotates the local optical axes. In conjunction with suitably designed structural properties, this geometric phase leads to the creation of topologically protected states of light. We propose and analyze in detail soft photonic realizations of two iconic topological systems: a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain and a Chern insulator. The use of soft building blocks potentially allows for reconfigurable systems that exploit the interplay between topological states of light and the underlying responsive medium.

ABSTRACT: Synthetic dimension emerges as a new frontier of the researches in nanophotonics and topological photonics. It is general believed that the dimension of a physical system cannot be larger than its geometric dimensionality. With the introduction of additional synthetic dimensions, and combined with the intrinsic geometric dimension, one can investigate higher dimensional physics. Meanwhile, the synthetic dimension is highly controllable which contributes to the observation of many high-dimensional novel phenomena. In this review, we introduce the basic concepts of synthetic dimension in photonics, summarize various proposals and set-ups in generating new synthetic dimension, and briefly discuss potential contributions of synthetic dimension in fundamental physics as well as applications.

ABSTRACT: It is shown that the concept of topological phase transitions can be used to design nonlinear photonic structures exhibiting power thresholds and discontinuities in their transmittance. This provides a novel route to devising nonlinear optical isolators. Westudy three representative designs: (i) a waveguide array implementing a nonlinear 1D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, (ii) a waveguide array implementing a nonlinear 2D Haldane model, and (iii) a 2Dlattice of coupled-ring waveguides. In the first two cases, we find a correspondence between the topological transition of the underlying linear lattice and the power threshold of the transmittance, and show that the transmission behavior is attributable to the emergence of a self-induced topological soliton. In the third case, we show that the topological transition produces a discontinuity in the transmittance curve, which can be exploited to achieve sharp jumps in the power-dependent isolation ratio.

ABSTRACT: The application of topology, the mathematics of conserved properties under continuous deformations, is creating a range of new opportunities throughout photonics. This field was inspired by the discovery of topological insulators, in which interfacial electrons transport without dissipation, even in the presence of impurities. Similarly, the use of carefully designed wavevectorspace topologies allows the creation of interfaces that support new states of light with useful and interesting properties. In particular, this suggests unidirectional waveguides that allow light to flow around large imperfections without back-reflection. This Review explains the underlying principles and highlights how topological effects can be realized in photonic crystals, coupled resonators, metamaterials and quasicrystals.

ABSTRACT: Originating from the studies of two-dimensional condensed-matter states, the concept of topological order has recently been expanded to other fields of physics and engineering, particularly optics and photonics. Topological photonic structures have already overturned some of the traditional views on wave propagation and manipulation. The application of topological concepts to guided wave propagation has enabled novel photonic devices, such as reflection-free sharply bent waveguides, robust delay lines, spin-polarized switches and non-reciprocal devices. Discrete degrees of freedom, widely used in condensed-matter physics, such as spin and valley, are now entering the realm of photonics. In this Review, we summarize the latest advances in this highly dynamic field, with special emphasis on the experimental work on two-dimensional photonic topological structures.

ABSTRACT: The propagation of light is generally reciprocal. Optical reciprocity, also known as temporal inversion symmetry, is essentially the existence of reciprocal solutions supported by Maxwell's equations. However, traditional reciprocal optical components suffer from problems such as the optical diffraction limit, which limits their further development toward high performance. In recent years, with the rapid development of topological photonics, it has been found that topological photon states have one-way transmission properties with forward conduction and reverse blocking state. At the same time, local structural defects will not influence global properties in optical topology, therefore, non-reciprocal topological photon states have many excellent physical properties, such as immunity to obstacles and defects, which can ensure that the one-way transmission has strong robustness and consequently promises potential applications such as optical integrated circuits and nonlinear optics. Magneto-optical photonic crystals based on gyromagnetic materials are the earliest topological optical structures to realize non-reciprocal topological photon states. They are also the most commonly used topological optical structures to study the generation, interaction and novel topological optical phenomena of topological photon states, which still contain a series of physical mechanisms worthy of further exploration. However, an external magnetic field is required, which affects the integration of optical devices, the frequency is limited to the microwave, and the gyromagnetic material has a weak response to the magnetic field, so it is still difficult to realize the integer quantum Hall effect of light, thus limiting its practical application prospects. Magnetoplasma is a simple material with non-reciprocal, rotational and homogeneous medium. The maximum non-reciprocity can be achieved by optimizing the permittivity tensor or the permeability tensor since the strength of the non-reciprocity depends on the relative strength of the diagonal tensor elements and the off-diagonal tensor elements. According to the Onsanger-Casimir principle, the dielectric constant tensor of a magnetic plasma is asymmetric, which implies the breakdown of the Lorentz reciprocity. The near-field electromagnetic wave propagating at the interface of magneto-optical materials under the action of a magnetic field is called a magnetic surface plasmon, which has non-reciprocal transmission characteristics. The unidirectional waveguide structure based on magnetic surface plasmon not only has a local enhancement effect, but also can break the diffraction limit, which lays a solid foundation for the development of new optical functional devices with high performance, high resolution, and high integration in space environment detection. At the same time, we also note that non-reciprocal transmission based on plasmon may be subject to absorption interference, and its practical value needs further verification. The optical nonlinear effect is also one of the ways to achieve non-reciprocal transmission. To achieve non-reciprocal transmission, the most likely development direction is to design topologically protected nonlinear optical phenomena in accordance with the topological edge soliton phase formed by Hall edge states in photonic crystals. It is easy to realize the system integration without the external magnetic field to achieve non-reciprocal transmission. However, in order to achieve nonlinear effects, it usually requires extremely high electric/magnetic field strength or extensive use of nonlinear materials, which greatly limits its application. Finally, this paper also briefly discusses non-reciprocal transmission based on other principles, such as breaking optical reciprocity using time modulation, non-reciprocal optical transmission based on synthetic angular momentum, and the use of coupling characteristics between nonlinear resonators, and so on. Non-reciprocal optical transmission based on time, phase, and energy modulation, as well as losses, also faces instability issues. This is currently a major research direction in the field, with one potential solution being to design systems related to and protected by topology to realize non-reciprocal transmission, thereby reducing losses caused by reverse transport in optical devices. Additionally, we analyzed and looked forward to its future development trends and key issues it may face.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics is an emerging platform to study light-matter interactions with promising features such as robust edge state transmission that could be advantageous for quantum information applications. However, applying common topological photonic designs for visible wavelength light-matter interactions is challenging because materials compatible with the visible spectrum have lower refractive index contrasts. We design and demonstrate a novel valley Hall topological photonic crystal that can support a complete topological band gap in the visible spectrum. We also show an overetch procedure can be used to reduce the leakage loss common for low index contrast materials. To demonstrate these advantages, we fabricate topological photonic devices following these design principles and show that edge states at energies in the complete band gap have robust transmission around sharp corners. The compatibility of this photonic structure with straightforward fabrication methods will facilitate the study of interactions between topologically nontrivial photons and nanomaterials active in the visible spectrum.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics provides an ideal platform for demonstrating novel band topology concepts, which are also promising for robust waveguiding, communication, and computation applications. However, many challenges such as extremely large device footprint and functionality at short wavelengths remain to be solved which are required to make practical and useful devices that can also couple to electronic excitations in many important organic and inorganic semiconductors. In this letter, we report an experimental realization of Z(2) photonic topological insulators with their topological edge state energies spanning across the visible wavelength range including in the sub-500 nm regime, which requires highly optimized nanofabrication. The photonic structures are based on deformed hexagonal lattices with preserved 6-fold rotational symmetry patterned on suspended SiNx membranes. The experimentally measured energy-momentum dispersion of the topological lattices directly shows topological band inversion by the swapping of the brightness of the bulk energy bands, and also the helical edge states when the measurement is taken near the topological interface. The robust topological transport of the helical edge modes in real space is demonstrated by successfully guiding circularly polarized light beams unidirectionally through sharp kinks without significant signal loss. This work paves the way for small footprint photonic topological devices working in the short wavelength range that can also be utilized to couple to excitons for unconventional light-matter interactions at the nanoscale.

ABSTRACT: In this paper, we review the specific field that combines topological photonics and deep learning (DL). Recent progress of topological photonics has attracted enormous interest for its novel and exotic properties such as unidirectional propagation of electromagnetic waves and robust manipulation of photons. These phenomena are expected to meet the growing demands of next-generation nanophotonic devices. However, to model and engineer such highly-complex systems are challenging. Recently, DL, a subset of machine learning methods using neural network (NN) algorithms, has been introduced in the field of nanophotonics as an effective way to capture a complex nonlinear relationship between design parameters and their corresponding optical properties. In particular, among various fields of nanophotonics, DL applications to topological photonics empowered by NN models have shown astonishing results in capturing the global material properties of topological systems. This review presents fundamental concepts of topological photonics and the basics of DL applied to nanophotonics in parallel. Recent studies of DL applications to topological systems using NN models are discussed thereafter. The summary and outlook showing the potential of taking data-driven approaches in topological photonics research and general physics are also discussed. [GRAPHICS] .

ABSTRACT: Control of terahertz waves offers a profound platform for next-generation sensing, imaging, and information communications. However, all conventional terahertz components and systems suffer from bulky design, sensitivity to imperfections, and transmission loss. We propose and experimentally demonstrate on-chip integration and miniaturization of topological devices, which may address many existing drawbacks of the terahertz technology. We design and fabricate topological devices based on valley-Hall photonic structures that can be employed for various integrated components of on-chip terahertz systems. We demonstrate valley-locked asymmetric energy flow and mode conversion with topological waveguide, multiport couplers, wave division, and whispering gallery mode resonators. Our devices are based on topological membrane metasurfaces, which are of great importance for developing on-chip photonics and bring many features into terahertz technology.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics is a rapidly developing field that leverages geometric and topological concepts to engineer and control the characteristics of light. Currently, the research on topological photonics has expanded from traditional one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) to three-dimensional (3D) and higher-dimensional spaces. However, most reviews on topological photonics focus on 1D and 2D systems, and a review that provides a detailed classification and introduction of 3D and higher-dimensional systems is still missing. Here, we review the photonic topological states in 3D and higher-dimensional systems on different platforms. Moreover, we discuss internal connections between different photonic topological phases and look forward to the future development direction and potential applications of 3D and higher-dimensional systems.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics was initially inspired by the quantum-optical analogy between the Schrodinger equation for an electron wavefunction and the paraxial equation for a light beam. Here, we reveal an unexpected phenomenon in topological pumping observed in arrays of nonparaxial optical waveguides where the quantum-optical analogy becomes invalid. We predict theoretically and demonstrate experimentally an asymmetric topological pumping when the injected field transfers from one side of the waveguide array to the other side whereas the reverse process is unexpectedly forbidden. Our finding could open an avenue for exploring topological photonics that enables nontrivial topological phenomena and designs in photonics driven by nonparaxiality. The understanding of the topological properties of light is at the base of the future optical devices development. In this work the authors aim to suggesting a different paradigm for topological transport and manipulation of nonparaxial light, paving the way toward the new developments in the field of topological photonics

ABSTRACT: Microcavity polaritons are light-matter quasiparticles that arise from the strong coupling between excitons and photons confined in a semiconductor microcavity. They are typically studied at visible or near visible wavelengths. They combine the properties of confined electromagnetic fields, including a sizeable spin-orbit coupling, and the sensitivity to external magnetic fields and particle interactions inherited from their partly matter nature. These features make polaritons an excellent platform to study topological phases in photonics in one and twodimensional lattices, whose band properties can be directly accessed using standard optical tools. In this review, we describe the main properties of microcavity polaritons and the main observations in the field of topological photonics, which include, among others, lasing in topological edge states, the implementation of a polariton Chern insulator under an external magnetic field, and the direct measurement of fundamental quantities, such as the quantum geometric tensor and winding numbers in one- and two-dimensional lattices. Polariton interactions open exciting perspectives for the study of nonlinear topological phases.

ABSTRACT: Recent years have witnessed a flurry of research activities in topological photonics, predominantly driven by the prospect for topological protection-a property that endows such systems with robustness against local defects, disorder, and perturbations. This field emerged in fermionic environments and primarily evolved within the framework of quantum mechanics which is by nature a Hermitian theory. However, in light of the ubiquitous presence of non-Her miticity in a host of natural and artificial settings, one of the most pressing questions today is how non -Her miticity may affect some of the predominant features of topological arrangements and whether or not novel topological phases may arise in non-conservative and out of equilibrium systems that are open to the environment. Here, we provide a brief overview of recent developments and ongoing efforts in this field and present our perspective on future directions and potential challenges. Special attention will be given to the interplay of topology and non-Hermiticity-an aspect that could open up new frontiers in physical sciences and could lead to promising opportunities in terms of applications in various disciplines of photonics.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics provides a new opportunity for the examination of novel topological properties of matter, in which the energy band theory and ideas in topology are utilized to manipulate the propagation of photons. Since the discovery of topological insulators in condensed matter, researchers have studied similar topological effects in photonics. Topological photonics can lead to materials that support the robust unidirectional propagation of light without back reflec-tions. This ideal transport property is unprecedented in traditional optics and may lead to radical changes in integrated optical devices. In this review, we present the exciting developments of topological photonics and focus on several promi-nent milestones of topological phases in photonics, such as topological insulators, topological semimetals, and higher-order topological phases. We conclude with the prospect of novel topological effects and their applications in topological photonics.

ABSTRACT: The notion of non-Hermitian optics and photonics rooted in quantum mechanics and photonic systems has recently attracted considerable attention ushering in tremendous progress on theoretical foundations and photonic applications, benefiting from the flexibility of photonic platforms. In this review, we first introduce the non-Hermitian topological physics from the symmetry of matrices and complex energy spectra to the characteristics of Jordan normal forms, exceptional points, biorthogonal eigenvectors, Bloch/non-Bloch band theories, topological invariants and topological classifications. We further review diverse non-Hermitian system branches ranging from classical optics, quantum photonics to disordered systems, nonlinear dynamics and optomechanics according to various physical equivalences and experimental implementations. In particular, we include cold atoms in optical lattices in quantum photonics due to their operability at quantum regimes. Finally, we summarize recent progress and limitations in this emerging field, giving an outlook on possible future research directions in theoretical frameworks and engineering aspects.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics is a new and rapidly growing field that deals with topological phases and topological insulators for light. Recently, the scope of these systems was expanded dramatically by incorporating non-spatial degrees of freedom. These synthetic dimensions can range from a discrete ladder of cavity modes or Bloch modes of an array of waveguides to a time-bin division (discrete time steps) in a pulsed system or even to parameters such as lattice constants. Combining spatial and synthetic dimensions offers the possibility to observe fundamental and exotic phenomena such as dynamics in four dimensions or higher, long-range interaction with disorder, high-dimensional nonlinear effects, and more. Here, we review the latest developments in using non-spatial dimensions as a means to enhance fundamental features of photonic topological systems, and we attempt to identify the next challenges.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics promotes an efficient approach to resilient light manipulation by exploiting spatiotemporal symmetries of the system and dual symmetry of the electromagnetic field. Various prospective device applications pose the need to flexibly control robust field localization associated with topological modes. Here we design a topological array of resonant dielectric meta-atoms with bianisotropic response induced by a spatial symmetry reduction. Mutual orientation of the designed meta-atoms encodes a staggered bianisotropy pattern capable of trapping topological states in a one-dimensional array containing a small number of particles. We show that the topological interface state can be tailored by the rotation of coaxial bianisotropic particles arranged in an equidistant lattice. Our experimental implementation based on ceramic horseshoe-shaped disks demonstrates remarkable reconfigurability of electromagnetic topological states.

ABSTRACT: Recent research in topological photonics has not only proposed and realized novel topological phenomena such as one-way broadband propagation and robust transport of light, but also designed and fabricated photonic devices with high-performance indexes, which are immune to fabrication errors such as defects or disorders. Photonic crystals, which are periodic optical structures with the advantages of good light field confinement and multiple adjusting degrees of freedom, provide a powerful platform to control the flow of light. With the topology defined in the reciprocal space, photonic crystals have been widely used to reveal different topological phases of light and demonstrate topological photonic functionalities. This review presents the physics of topological photonic crystals with different dimensions, models, and topological phases. The design methods of topological photonic crystals are introduced. Furthermore, the applications of topological photonic crystals in passive and active photonics are reviewed. These studies pave the way for applying topological photonic crystals in practical photonic devices.

ABSTRACT: Topological features-global properties not discernible locally-emerge in systems ranging from liquid crystals to magnets to fractional quantum Hall systems. A deeper understanding of the role of topology in physics has led to a new class of matter-topologically ordered systems. The best known examples are quantum Hall effects, where insensitivity to local properties manifests itself as conductance through edge states that is insensitive to defects and disorder. Current research into engineering topological order primarily focuses on analogies to quantum Hall systems, where the required magnetic field is synthesized in non-magnetic systems. Here, we realize synthetic magnetic fields for photons at room temperature, using linear silicon photonics. We observe, for the first time, topological edge states of light in a two-dimensional system and show their robustness against intrinsic and introduced disorder. Our experiment demonstrates the feasibility of using photonics to realize topological order in both non-interacting and many-body regimes.

ABSTRACT: Topological insulators, originally discovered in the context of condensed matter physics, have provided a powerful source of inspiration for the design of novel types of photonic crystals and waveguides. It was unveiled that the quantized global characteristics of the band structure and eigenfunctions in the reciprocal space underpin exotic properties of topological materials, such as their abilities to support scattering-resistant wave transport along the edges or boundary surfaces and host robust confined states at corners or hinges. The topological physics brought to the realm of photonics is enriched by non-Hermitian and nonlinear effects and holds special promise for disorder-immune device applications. We review the recent progress in implementing topological states of light in a plethora of platforms, including metacrystals, arrays of microring resonators and optical waveguide lattices, that furthermore bridges to advances in quantum optics and nonlinear nanophotonics.

ABSTRACT: Topological valley photonics has emerged as a new frontier in photonics with many promising applications. Previous valley boundary transport relies on kink states at internal boundaries between two topologically distinct domains. However, recent studies have revealed a novel class of topological chiral edge states (CESs) at external boundaries of valley materials, which have remained elusive in photonics. Here, topological CESs are proposed and experimentally demonstrated in valley photonic metamaterials (VPMMs) by accurately tuning on-site edge potentials. Moreover, the VPMMs work at deep-subwavelength scales. Thus, the supported CESs are highly confined and self-guiding without relying on a cladding layer to prevent leakage radiation. Via direct near-field measurements, the bulk bandgap, the edge dispersions, and the robust edge transport passing through sharp corners, which are hallmark signatures of the CESs, are observed. This work paves a way to explore novel topological edge states in valley photonics and sheds light on robust and miniaturized photonic devices.

ABSTRACT: We discuss experimental and theoretical studies of the generation of the third terahertz (THz) frequency harmonic in thin films of Bi2Se3 and Bi2-xSbxTe3-ySey (BSTS) topological insulators (TIs) and the generation of THz radiation in photoconductive antennas based on the TI films. The experimental results, supported by the developed kinetic theory of third harmonic generation, show that the frequency conversion in TIs is highly efficient because of the linear energy spectrum of the surface carriers and fast energy dissipation. In particular, the dependence of the third harmonic field on the pump field remains cubic up to the pump fields of 100 kV/cm. The generation of THz radiation in TI-based antennas is obtained and described for the pump, with the energy of photons corresponding to the electron transitions to higher conduction bands. Our findings open up possibilities for advancing TI-based films into THz photonics as efficient THz wave generators and frequency converters.

ABSTRACT: In the past few decades, the discovery of topological matter states has ushered in a new era in topological physics, providing a robust framework for strategically controlling the transport of particles or waves. Topological photonics, in particular, has sparked considerable research due to its ability to construct and manipulate photonic topological states via photonic artificial microstructures. Although the concept of topology originates from condensed matter, topological photonics has given rise to new fundamental ideas and a range of potential applications that may lead to revolutionary technologies. Here, we review recent developments in topological photonics, with a focus on the realization and application of several emerging research areas in photonic artificial microstructures. We highlight the research trend, spanning from the photonic counterpart of topological insulator phases, through topological semimetal phases, to other emerging non-Hermitian topologies.

ABSTRACT: The topological properties of a coupled-cavity array corresponding to a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model have been investigated through the evolution of a edge cavity, with the Kerr-like nonlinearities added to the inter-cavity coupling strengths. In the topological phase, the state distribution is more localized at the first cavity with the nonlinearities enhanced. The phase transition occurs with the enhancement of nonlinearities after the system evolving for long time when the SSH model is initially at the phase-transition point or in the trivial phase. The entanglement dynamics of two atoms placed in the two edge cavities is explored, and it is found the coupled-cavity array with nonlinearities is more robust against the disturbance of the frequency of each cavity. Moreover, the dynamics and phase transition of a 2-dimensional kagome lattice with the Kerr-like nonlinearities is also discussed through the probability amplitude of the first site after evolving for long time.

ABSTRACT: The recent realization of photonic topological insulators has brought the discovery of fundamentally new states of light and revolutionary applications such as nonreciprocal devices for photonic diodes and robust waveguides for light routing. The spatially distinguished layer pseudospin has attracted attention in two-dimensional electronic materials but it is yet to be discovered in topological photonic structures. Here, all-dielectric layered photonic topological insulators based on bilayer photonic crystal slabs are reported. The introduction of layer pseudospin offers more dispersion engineering capability, leading to the layer-polarized and layer-mixed photonic topological insulators. Their phase transition is demonstrated with a model Hamiltonian by considering the nonzero interlayer coupling. Layer-direction locking behavior of layer-polarized photonic topological insulators results in the selective light refraction. High transmission is observed in the bilayer domain wall between two layer-mixed photonic topological insulators, even when a large defect is introduced. Layered photonic topological insulators not only offer a route toward the observation of richer nontrivial phases, but also open a way for device applications in integrated photonics and information processing by using the additional layer pseudospin.

ABSTRACT: Topological darkness is a new phenomenon that guarantees zero reflection/transmission of light from an optical sample and hence provides topologically nontrivial phase singularities. Here we consider topological darkness in an optical heterostructure that consists of an (unknown) layer placed on a composite substrate and suggest an algorithm that can be used to predict and confirm the presence of topological darkness. The algorithm is based on a combination of optical measurements and the Fresnel equations. We apply this algorithm to ultrathin Pd films fabricated on a Si/SiO2/Cr substrate and extract four different points of topological darkness. Our results will be useful for topological photonics and label-free optical biosensing based on phase interrogation.

ABSTRACT: Over the past decade, topology has emerged as a major branch in broad areas of physics, from atomic lattices to condensed matter. In particular, topology has received significant attention in photonics because light waves can serve as a platform to investigate nontrivial bulk and edge physics with the aid of carefully engineered photonic crystals and metamaterials. Simultaneously, photonics provides enriched physics that arises from spin-1 vectorial electromagnetic fields. Here, we review recent progress in the growing field of topological photonics in three parts. The first part is dedicated to the basics of topological band theory and introduces various two-dimensional topological phases. The second part reviews three-dimensional topological phases and numerous approaches to achieve them in photonics. Last, we present recently emerging fields in topological photonics that have not yet been reviewed. This part includes topological degeneracies in nonzero dimensions, unidirectional Maxwellian spin waves, higher-order photonic topological phases, and stacking of photonic crystals to attain layer pseudospin. In addition to the various approaches for realizing photonic topological phases, we also discuss the interaction between light and topological matter and the efforts towards practical applications of topological photonics. Topological photonics: Light and topology linked in theory and practiceThe structural property of materials known as their topology can be exploited to control the behavior of light in the emerging field of topological photonics, offering potential applications in areas including topology theory, optical communication and optical computing. Researchers in South Korea and the USA, led by Junsuk Rho at Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH) in South Korea, review recent progress in this rapidly developing field. They consider detailed theoretical and practical aspects of the interaction of light with materials whose topology influences the behavior of light waves. These materials include 'photonic crystals' and 'metamaterials', which have structural features on scales shorter than the wavelength of light. The authors also discuss progress towards developing practical applications for topological photonics. The ability to achieve highly efficient light transmission without dissipation is particularly promising.

ABSTRACT: Electromagnetic filtering is essential for emerging integrated photonic technologies and widely adaptable processing of high-bandwidth signals. The conventional electro-optic modulator-based photonic approach for signal filtering at microwave frequencies cannot be implemented at terahertz (THz) frequencies due to the unavailability of the THz signal-driven optical modulator. Here, an electrically tunable on-chip THz photonic notch filter based on the topologically protected valley hall waveguide-cavity platform is demonstrated. The device shows a significantly large notch suppression depth of more than 20 dB with a return loss of 13 dB in the entire tuning range of notch frequency. The feedback control circuit enables precise control of the notch frequency shift with a minimum step size of 7 MHz. This work extends the application of topological photonic crystals in developing THz-integrated photonic devices for transformative technologies, including sixth-generation (6G) communication and high-resolution spectral sensing. A low-loss terahertz (THz) silicon topological notch filter is devised by critically coupling a topological cavity with an interconnect, enabling a large notch suppression depth exceeding 20 dB. With an electrical control, the notch frequency is actively tuned, ensuring negligible return loss, which is vital for signal processing in THz topological photonic integrated circuits (T2PIC).image

ABSTRACT: Quantum simulation involves engineering devices to implement different Hamiltonians and measuring their quantized spectra to study quantum many-body systems. Recent developments in topological photonics have shown the possibility of studying novel quantum phenomena by controlling the topological properties of such devices. Here, using coupled arrays of up to 16 high Q silicon nanocavities, we experimentally realize quantum photonic baths, which are analogs of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. We investigate the effect of fabrication-induced disorder on these baths by probing individual supermodes. We further demonstrate the design mitigation steps required to overcome the disorder effects in photonic cavities to simulate quantum systems.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics provides a new paradigm in studying cavity quantum electrodynamics with robustness to disorder. In this work, the coupling between single quantum dots and the second-order topological corner state are demonstrated. Based on the second-order topological corner state, a topological photonic crystal cavity is designed and fabricated into GaAs slabs with quantum dots embedded. The coexistence of corner state and edge state with high quality factor close to 2000 is observed. The enhancement of photoluminescence intensity and emission rate are both observed when the quantum dot is on resonance with the corner state. This result enables the application of topology into cavity quantum electrodynamics, offering an approach to topological devices for quantum information processing.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics has emerged recently as a novel approach for realizing robust optical circuitry, and the study of nonlinear effects in topological photonics is expected to open the door for tunability of photonic structures with topological properties. Here, the topological edge states and topological gap solitons which reside in the same band gaps described by the nonlinear Dirac model are studied, in both one and two dimensions. Strong nonlinear interactions between these dissimilar topological modes, manifested in the efficient excitation of topological edge states by scattered traveling gap solitons are revealed. Nonlinear tunability of localized states is explicated with exact analytical solutions for the two-component spinor wave function. Our studies are complemented by spatiotemporal numerical modeling of the nonlinear scattering in 1D and 2D photonic lattices.

ABSTRACT: Topological protection in photonics offers new prospects for confining and guiding light waves. Up to now, most reported works on topological photonics have focused on the realization of topological phases originally found in condensed matter systems. However, photonic systems can possess a distinguishing topology that differs from their quantum electronic counterparts due to the vectorial nature of light. Here, dual-polarization topological photonic states are theoretically predicted and experimentally demonstrated at optical frequencies on the all-dielectric silicon-on-insulator platform. The topological band gaps opening at K/K ' valleys for both TE- and TM-polarizations in the properly designed breathing Kagome photonic crystal slabs are demonstrated, leading to dual-polarization topological edge states below the light cone. The topological edge states are directly observed by imagining the near fields with scattering scanning near-field microscopy. In addition, the significant improvement of the quality factor of topological states via engineering the transition near the boundary along with the robustness of edge states is presented. The proposed dual-polarization topological states and the improvement of quality factor via boundary profile engineering paves the way toward novel applications of topological photonics for realizing integrated polarization-dependent applications such as polarization multiplexing photonic devices and on-chip chiral quantum optics. Topological photonics offers new prospects for confining and guiding light waves. For the first time, dual-polarization topological edge states are experimentally demonstrated on the silicon-on-insulator platform at optical frequencies. The topological edge states are directly observed by imaging the near fields with scattering scanning near-field optical microscopy.image

ABSTRACT: Chiral quantum optics and Topological photonics are both emerging field of research, which have attracted great attention in recent years. Chiral quantum optics provides a new approach to achieve full quantum control of light-matter interaction in a novel manner, which has potential possibility for the implementation of complex quantum information networks. Meanwhile, topological photonics provides a novel route for designing and realizing optical device with unprecedented functionality, such as robust light propagation, the immunity to various structural imperfection, back-scattering suppression as well as unidirectional transmission. The application of topological photonics in chiral quantum optics will promote the whole performance of integrated quantum device with topological protection. In this review, we summarize the progress of chiral quantum optics and topological photonics firstly. Then, we mainly focus on the research of topological chiral edge states based on photonic quantum spin-Hall effect and photonic quantum valley-Hall effect. Furthermore, we introduce the recent work of chiral topological quantum interface formed by embedding quantum dot into the interface between two topologically distinct photonic crystal structures. At last, we give short outlook on the future development direction and prospect for application of topological chiral quantum interface.

ABSTRACT: In the past few years, concepts from non-Hermitian (NH) physics, originally developed within the context of quantum field theories, have been successfully deployed over a wide range of physical settings where wave dynamics are known to play a key role. In optics, a special class of NH Hamiltonians - which respects parity-time symmetry - has been intensely pursued along several fronts. What makes this family of systems so intriguing is the prospect of phase transitions and NH singularities that can in turn lead to a plethora of counterintuitive phenomena. Quite recently, these ideas have permeated several other fields of science and technology in a quest to achieve new behaviors and functionalities in nonconservative environments that would have otherwise been impossible in standard Hermitian arrangements. Here, we provide an overview of recent advancements in these emerging fields, with emphasis on photonic NH platforms, exceptional point dynamics, and the very promising interplay between non-Hermiticity and topological physics.

ABSTRACT: Topological manipulation of waves is at the heart of cutting-edge metamaterial research. Quadrupole topological insulators were recently discovered in 2D flux-threading lattices that exhibit higher-order topological wave trapping at both the edges and corners. Photonic crystals (PhCs), lying at the boundary between continuous media and discrete lattices, however, are incompatible with the present quadrupole topological theory. Here, quadrupole topological PhCs triggered by a twisting degree-of-freedom are unveiled. Using a topologically trivial PhC as the motherboard, it is shown that twisting induces quadrupole topological PhCs without flux-threading. The twisting-induced crystalline symmetry enriches the Wannier polarizations and leads to the anomalous quadrupole topology. Versatile edge and corner phenomena are observed by controlling the twisting angles in a lateral heterostructure of 2D PhCs. This study paves the way toward topological twist photonics as well as the quadrupole topology in the quasi-continuum regime for phonons and polaritons.

ABSTRACT: Rapid development of topological concepts in photonics unveils exotic phenomena such as unidirectional propagation of electromagnetic waves resilient to backscattering at sharp bends and disorder-immune localization of light at stable frequencies. Recently introduced higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs) bring in additional degrees of control over light confinement and steering. However, designs of photonic HOTIs reported so far are solely exploiting lattice geometries which are hard to reconfigure thus limiting tunability. This article reports a conceptually new mechanism to engineer topological edge and corner states including higher-order topological phases which exploits both electric and magnetic responses of the meta-atoms. Hybridization between these responses gives rise to the difference in the effective coupling which is controlled by the meta-atoms mutual orientations. This feature allows to tailor photonic band topology exclusively via particle alignment and flexibly reconfigure the topological phase. Focusing on the kagome array of split-ring resonators, the topological edge and corner states are experimentally demonstrated in the microwave domain. To highlight the generality of this proposal, the formation of higher-order topological phase is also predicted numerically in a C-6-symmetric lattice of split-ring resonators. These findings provide a new promising route to induce and control higher-order topological phases and states.

ABSTRACT: Based on in-plane anisotropy of black phosphorus (BP), anisotropic photonics topological transition (PTT) can be achieved by the proposed hyperbolic metamaterials structure, which is composed of alternating BP/SiO2 multilayer. Through effective medium theory and calculated iso-frequency contour, PTT can be found by carefully choosing the incident plane and other parameters. With the finite element method and transfer matrix method, a narrow angular optical transparency window with angular full width at half maximum of 1.32 degrees exists at PTT. By changing the working wavelength, thickness of SiO2, or electron doping of black phosphorus, the incident plane of realizing PTT can be modulated, and anisotropic PTT is achieved.

ABSTRACT: Valley pseudospin, a new degree of freedom in photonic lattices, provides an intriguing way to manipulate photons and enhance the robustness of optical networks. Here, topological waveguiding, refracting, resonating, and routing of valley-polarized photons in integrated circuits are experimentally demonstrated. Specifically, it is shown that at the domain wall between photonic crystals of different topological valley phases, there exists a topologically protected valley kink state that is backscattering-free at sharp bends and terminals. These valley kink states are further harnessed for constructing high-Q topological photonic crystal cavities with tortuously shaped cavity geometries. A novel optical routing scheme at an intersection of multiple valley kink states is also demonstrated, where light splits counterintuitively due to the valley pseudospin of photons. These results can not only lead to robust optical communication and signal processing, but also open the door for fundamental research of topological photonics in areas such as lasing, quantum photon-pair generation, and optomechanics.

ABSTRACT: Topological phases play a novel and fundamental role in matter and display extraordinary robustness to smooth changes in material parameters or disorder. A crossover between topological material and quantum information may lead to inherent fault-tolerant quantum simulations and quantum computing. Quantum features may be preserved by being encoded among topological structures of physical evolution systems. This requires stimulation, manipulation, and observation of topological phenomena at the single quantum particle level, which has not, however, yet been realized. It is asked whether the quantum features of single photons can be preserved in topological structures. The boundary states are experimentally observed at the genuine single-photon level and the performance of the topological phase is demonstrated to protect the quantum features against diffusion-induced decoherence in coupled waveguides and noise decoherence from the ambient environment. Compatibility between macroscopic topological states and microscopic single photons in the ambient environment is thus confirmed, leading to a new avenue to quantum topological photonics and providing more new possibilities for quantum materials and quantum technologies.

ABSTRACT: Higher-order topological insulators hosting topological modes at hinges and corners provide a new avenue for disorder-immune light transport, which prospects great potential in applications of integrated photonics devices. However, the active control of topological modes in 3D higher-order topological insulators is not realized yet, and its construction is too complicated and huge to analyze. Here, a method is proposed to construct effective Hamiltonians for higher-order topological insulators, which provides a correct physical picture of the states and the corresponding energies at the domain walls. A non-Hermitian 3D honeycomb lattice is constructed, which can generate arbitrary-located, arbitrary-shaped, and robust topological hinge states propagating at gain-loss domain walls. The 3D honeycomb lattice can also appear as non-Hermitian third-order TIs exhibiting corner states, which can be dynamically controlled and show new topologically protected confinement rules. This work expands the understanding of the topological properties in non-Hermitian systems and enables the dynamic control of topological states of different dimensions. A method is proposed to construct effective Hamiltonians describing states and the corresponding energies at the gain-loss domain walls for higher-order topological insulators. Non-Hermitian 3D topological photonic crystals generating arbitrary-located, arbitrary-shaped, and robust topological hinge states propagating at gain-loss domain walls are constructed, which can be actively controlled by non-Hermiticity.image

ABSTRACT: Tremendous efforts are devoted to the research of exotic photonic topological states, in which Floquet systems suggest new engineered topological phases and provide a powerful tool to manipulate the optical fields. Here, a gauge-induced topological state localized at the interface between two gauge-shifted Floquet photonic lattices with the same topological order is demonstrated. The quasienergy band structures reveal that these interface modes belong to the Floquet pi modes, which are further found to enable an asymmetric topological transport of this interface mode thanks to the flexible control of the Floquet gauge. The intriguing propagations of the gauge-induced topological states are experimentally verified in a silicon waveguides platform at near-infrared wavelengths, which show broadband working wavelengths and robustness against the structural fluctuations. This work provides a new route in manipulating optical topological modes by Floquet engineering and inspires more possibilities in photonics integrations.

ABSTRACT: Photonic topological edge states are robust against the structural disorder, paving the way of their broad applications in the field of photonics. In the meantime, the topological phase transitions of parity-time (PT) symmetric systems have been extensively investigated. This report presents another new concept, PT symmetric photonic topological waveguides, being PT symmetric as a whole, but with gain/loss waveguides supporting topological edge modes. Through the theoretical and numerical investigations, we demonstrate unidirectional propagation in valley-Hall photonic topological coupled waveguides in a PT-broken phase as an example. Such waveguides can exhibit numerous photonic functionalities observable in PT symmetric photonic systems, the performances of which are robust against the defects due to the topological nature of the constituent waveguides.

ABSTRACT: Monolithic integration of energy-efficient and ultracompact light sources on an industry-standard Si platform has emerged as a promising technology to realize fully integrated Si-based photonic integrated circuits. Recently, semiconductor topological lasers using topologically protected defect modes have received extensive investigation, owing to their unique merits, including robustness against structural imperfections and disorders. However, due to the significant material dissimilarities between Si and III-V materials, previous demonstrations of semiconductor topological lasers have been limited to their native substrates. Here, we experimentally report ultralow threshold, continuous wave, optically pumped, single-mode, InAs/GaAs quantum dot, topological corner state nanolasers monolithically integrated on a CMOS-compatible Si (001) substrate. Our results represent a new route toward ultracompact and highperformance integrated nanoscale light sources for Si photonics and enable promising applications for topological photonics.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics has emerged as a novel paradigm for the design of electromagnetic systems from microwaves to nanophotonics. Studies to date have largely focused on the demonstration of fundamental concepts, such as nonreciprocity and waveguiding protected against fabrication disorder. Moving forward, there is a pressing need to identify applications where topological designs can lead to useful improvements in device performance. Here, we review applications of topological photonics to ring resonator-based systems, including one- and two-dimensional resonator arrays, and dynamically modulated resonators. We evaluate potential applications such as quantum light generation, disorder-robust delay lines, and optical isolation, as well as future research directions and open problems that need to be addressed.

ABSTRACT: In recent years, topological photonic crystals have attracted growing interest for their unique propagation characteristics. With the development of theoretical models in topological photonics, numerous novel applications have emerged. Topological edge states formed by topological photonic crystals can realize optical enhancement and unidirectional transmission in optoelectronic devices.

ABSTRACT: Optical isolators, which break the Lorentz reciprocity, are fundamental building blocks for regulating the flow of light. Here, we provide a brief perspective on the developments in nonmagnetic approaches to constructing optical isolators. We show that nonlinear optical isolators are fundamentally constrained by dynamic reciprocity and cannot completely reproduce functionalities of standard magneto-optical devices. We also show that complete optical isolation is achievable with dynamic modulation of refractive index. Moreover, the reciprocity-breaking in modulated systems is closely related to the concept of an effective gauge potential for photons. The use of such gauge potential points to a route toward novel nonreciprocal topological photonics physics as well as new capabilities for controlling the propagation of electromagnetic waves.

ABSTRACT: Topology opens many new horizons for photonics, from integrated optics to lasers. The complexity of large-scale devices asks for an effective solution of the inverse problem: how best to engineer the topology for a specific application? We introduce a machine-learning approach applicable in general to numerous topological problems. As a toy model, we train a neural network with the Aubry-Andre-Harper band structure model and then adopt the network for solving the inverse problem. Our application is able to identify the parameters of a complex topological insulator in order to obtain protected edge states at target frequencies. One challenging aspect is handling the multivalued branches of the direct problem and discarding unphysical solutions. We overcome this problem by adopting a self-consistent method to only select physically relevant solutions. We demonstrate our technique in a realistic design and by resorting to the widely available open-source TensorFlow library.

ABSTRACT: Topological materials have been at the forefront of research across various fields of physics in hopes of harnessing properties such as scatterfree transport due to protection from defects and disorder. Photonic systems are ideal test beds for topological models and seek to profit from the idea of topological robustness for applications. Recent progress in 3D-printing of microscopic structures has allowed for a range of implementations of topological systems. We review recent work on topological models realized particularly in photonic crystals and waveguide arrays fabricated by 3D micro-printing. The opportunities that this technique provides are a result of its facility to tune the refractive index, compatibility with infiltration methods, and its ability to fabricate a wide range of flexible geometries.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics has expanded our understanding of electromagnetic wave propagation and unraveled new methods of electromagnetic wave shaping. Among the various topological photonic systems, valley photonic crystal (VPC) is a highly versatile platform for constructing interfaces that supports unidirectional edge state to enable the robust topological transport of light. Although silicon VPC waveguides has demonstrated the lossless propagation of terahertz (THz) waves through multiple sharp bends, existing designs are mostly based on the standard zigzag-interface. Here, we explore interfacial topological photonics by designing a composite interface junction for an air-slot-like VPC waveguide with a 60 degrees bend and an unchanging bearded-interface to allow the topologically protected propagation of THz waves over a 20% relative bandwidth. We employ particle swarm optimization to design the geometry of a bearded-interface silicon VPC waveguide to achieve a 42% relative bandgap and a topological edge state spanning a usable 25% relative bandwidth. Our work illustrates the prospects and challenges of interfacial topological photonics in the design of broadband silicon topological waveguides for potential applications across the electromagnetic spectrum, including the on-chip THz sixth-generation (6G) communication.

ABSTRACT: "Topological photonic edge states, protected by chiral symmetry, are attractive for guiding wave energy as they can allow for more robust guiding and greater control of light than alternatives  however, for photonics, chiral symmetry is often broken by long-range interactions. We look to overcome this difficulty by exploiting the topology of networks, consisting of voids and narrow connecting channels, formed by the spaces between closely spaced perfect conductors. In the limit of low frequencies and narrow channels, these void-channel systems have a direct mapping to analogous discrete mass-spring systems in an asymptotically rigorous manner and therefore only have short-range interactions. We demonstrate that topological tight-binding models that are protected by chiral symmetries, such as the SSH model and square-root semimetals, are reproduced for these void-channel networks with appropriate boundary conditions. We anticipate, moving forward, that this paper provides a basis from which to explore continuum photonic topological systems, in an asymptotically exact manner, through the lens of a simplified tight-binding model."

ABSTRACT: The global digitalization and the recent rise of artificial intelligence-based data-driven applications have directed their vectors towards terabits per second (Tbps) communication links. The existing 5G communication architect cannot fulfill this demand due to bandwidth scarcity, which has stimulated innovative technologies with a vision of 6G communication. Terahertz (THz) technologies have been identified as a critical candidate for the emerging 6G communication with the potential to provide ubiquitous connectivity and remove the barrier between physical, digital, and biological worlds. Nonetheless, the existing THz on-chip communication devices suffer from scattering loss, bending loss, limited data speed, and lack of active tunability. Here, I will describe a new class of active on-chip THz topological devices consisting of broadband single channel 160 Gbit/s communication link and ultrahigh-Q (Q similar to 106) cavities built on Silicon Valley Photonic Crystal. Silicon topological photonics will pave the path for augmentation of CMOS-compatible terahertz technologies, vital for accelerating the development of 6G communications that would empower societies with real-time terabits per second wireless connectivity for network sensing, holographic communication, cognitive internet of everything, and massive digital cloning of the physical and the biological world.

ABSTRACT: Dirac cones in photonic systems have many profound applications such as achieving zero-index materials and nontrivial photonic phases. It is shown that double Dirac cones at the zone boundary can be restored by achieving accidental degeneracy between transverse electric and transverse magnetic modes in 2D photonic crystals with anisotropic permittivity. The topological band gap can be obtained by lifting nontrivial double Dirac cones, each of which is formed by two orthogonally polarized linear branches sharing the same mirror parities. Robust transport of gapless and high transmission of gapped edge states are also demonstrated in topological anisotropic photonic crystals, demonstrating that a high transmission flat-top spectrum is observed in various working frequency regions even when the interface is no longer straight. This may pave the way to a paradigm for a bandwidth-controllable robust waveguide in topological photonics.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonic insulators have attracted considerable attention due to their unique ability to transport light via topologically-protected edge states that are immune to defect scattering. Among the various potential applications, this property can be exploited to engineer robust photonic devices that are insensitive to fabrication imperfections. This chapter reviews the key concepts of topological insulator systems in one and two dimensions and their realizations using coupled microring resonator lattices. Particular emphasis will be placed on the treatment of microring lattices as periodically-driven systems and their Floquet topological characteristics. Experimental efforts in realizing Floquet microring lattices and demonstrating anomalous Floquet insulator behaviors will also be reviewed.

ABSTRACT: The refractive index is one of the most basic optical properties of a material and its interaction with light. Modern materials engineering-particularly the concept of metamaterials-has made it necessary to consider its subtleties, including anisotropy and complex values. Here we re-examine the refractive index and find a general way to calculate the direction-dependent refractive index and the condition for zero index in a given direction. By analogy with linear versus circular polarization, we show that when the zero-index direction is complex-valued, a material supports waves that can propagate in only one sense, for example, clockwise. We show that there is an infinite family of both time-reversible and time-irreversible homogeneous electromagnetic media that support unidirectional propagation for a particular polarization. As well as extending the concept of the refractive index, shedding new light on our understanding of topological photonics and providing new sets of material parameters, our simple picture also reproduces many of the findings derived using topology.

ABSTRACT: Valley photonic crystal is a typical strategy of topological photonics with promising applications for novel integrated waveguides. The valley pseudospin provides an intrinsic paradigm to implement unidirectional coupling with robustly optical transport. But the key issue on the analysis of unidirectional coupling based on topological modes is lack of deep understanding on valley photonic crystals. In this work, we systematically study the mechanism and performance of unidirectional coupling between valley photonic crystal waveguides and chiral dipole emitters. Forming by two topologically-distinct valley photonic crystals, there are two types of valley-interface waveguides, i.e. bearded stack with glide-plane symmetry and zigzag stack with inversion symmetry. Analytical derivation shows that the Stokes parameters of topological eigenmodes can predict the directionality in the above two types of valley-interface waveguides, which is also confirmed by full-wave simulations. The strategy of bearded valley-interface waveguide can be easier to achieve high efficiency of unidirectional coupling than the zigzag case, and can relax the bias error of frequency and source location. It is also proved that the topological-protected unidirectional coupling supports robust transport against sharp-bending interface. Finally, we give a brief summary and perspective in the development of topological integrated photonics. This work gives a deterministic guidance on chiral light-matter interaction based on topological photonics, as well as shows the outlook of topological integrated photonics.

ABSTRACT: "Valley degrees of freedom, providing a novel way to increase capacity and efficiency of information processing, have become an important instrument for photonics. Experimental studies on photonic topological valley kink states at interfaces between regions with opposite valley-Chern numbers have attracted much attention  however, they are restricted to zigzag-type interfaces, largely limiting their applications such as geometry-dependent topological channel intersections. Here, valley kink states at generic interfaces in subwavelength substrate-integrated photonic circuitry are experimentally demonstrated and manipulated. The robustness of the kink states is verified by measuring transmissions of the kink states through twisted interfaces and interfaces with disorders. Based on the valley kink states at generic interfaces, several topological channel intersections where photonic transport paths are related to geometries of the intersections are realized. In comparison to those in previous work, these valley photonic crystals have subwavelength thicknesses and excellent self-consistent electrical shielding, which are perfectly compatible with conventional substrate-integrated photonic circuitry. This work opens a door to manipulate photonic valley pseudo-spins in lightweight substrate-integrated circuitry with robustness and easy access."

ABSTRACT: The two main research questions on time crystals are: What is a time crystal? Is there a material that is spontaneously crystalline in time? This study synthesizes a photonic material of topological Floquet time crystals and experimentally observes its indicative period-2T$2T$ beating. A single-particle picture is explicitly reconstructed of discrete time-crystalline phase and is revealed using an appropriately-designed photonic Floquet simulator the rigid period-doubling as a signature of the breakage of the discrete time-translational symmetry. Unlike the requirement of the many-body localization, the photonic Floquet time crystal is derived from a newly defined single-particle topological phase that can be extensively accessed by many pertinent nonequilibrium and periodically-driven platforms. The observation will drive theoretical and technological interests toward condensed matter physics and topological photonics.

ABSTRACT: Slow light waveguides are advantageous for implementing high-performance single-photon sources required for scalable operation of integrated quantum photonic circuits (IQPCs), though such waveguides are known to suffer from propagation loss due to backscattering. A way to overcome the drawback is to use topological photonics, in which robust waveguiding in topologically-protected optical modes has recently been demonstrated. Here, single-photon sources are reported using single quantum dots (QDs) embedded in topological slow light waveguides based on valley photonic crystals. Purcell-enhanced single-photon emission is demonstrated from a QD into a topological slow light mode with a group index over 20 and its robust propagation even under the presence of sharp bends. These results pave the way for the realization of robust and high-performance single-photon sources indispensable for IQPCs.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics is an important and rapidly growing field that offers a powerful way to manipulate light. The geometric and topological ideas in this field have thoroughly changed our understanding of light propagation. Floquet topological insulators are an important branch of topological photonics, where many novel physical phenomena are waiting to be explored. This is mainly due to the condensed matter community, which utilizes periodically driven systems to reveal new phases of matter that do not exist in equilibrium systems. This paper reviews the research on Floquet topological optical insulators over the last decade, starting from a classification of their implementations as time-based modulation, space-based modulation and resonator-coupling-based modulation of Floquet topological photonic insulators. More specifically, time-modulated Floquet topological photonic insulators represent a unique class of artificial photonic structures with special topological properties, characterized by the dynamic modulation of topological phase through a periodic time function. This modulation method introduces a distinct control mechanism to photonic systems, leading to an unprecedented light transport. A key feature of time-modulated Floquet topological photonic insulators is the realization of topological edge states by breaking time-reversal symmetry. These edge states can propagate unidirectionally along the system boundaries and exhibit robustness against defects and back-scattering. Compared with traditional static topological photonic insulators, the time-based modulation method introduces a new degree of freedom in the temporal domain, thereby offering a wider range of control strategies and application potential. Given the theoretical limitations of time-modulated Floquet topological photonic insulators along with experimental constraints due to the inability of active switching frequencies to meet experimental demands, practically experimental demonstrations in this field have encountered significant restrictions. To address this challenge, researchers have initiated the exploration of alternative methodologies. Among these, space-based Floquet topological photonic insulators have emerged as a noteworthy direction. This approach employs one spatial dimension as a surrogate for the time dimension, thereby enabling the realization of pertinent topological properties in Floquet topological photonic insulators without requiring additionally high switching frequencies. Therefore, this approach has garnered significant attention and achieved substantial progress in the field. However, due to the incompatibility with integrated photonic systems, the integration of temporal or spatial modulation on a semiconductor platform remains a challenge. To address this issue, the two-dimensional structure of coupled resonator optical waveguides has emerged as a robust platform for the study of topological photonic insulators, thanks to its unique structure and compatibility with traditional photonic integrated circuits. So far, research on Floquet topological photonic insulators based on coupled resonances is garnering increasing attention. In summary, we have demonstrated the unique topological properties and amazing physical phenomena as well as the broad research progress in applications are presented from both theoretical and applied aspects. The achievements and challenges in this field are reviewed and discussed, and further research on Floquet topological photonic insulators is foreseen.

ABSTRACT: Objectives: Rare-earth-doped nanocrystals are emerging light sources that can produce tunable emissions in colours and lifetimes, which has been typically achieved in chemistry and material science. However, one important optical challenge - polarization of photoluminescence - remains largely out of control by chemistry methods. Control over photoluminescence polarization can be gained via coupling of emitters to resonant nanostructures such as optical antennas and metasurfaces. However, the resulting polarization is typically sensitive to position disorder of emitters, which is difficult to mitigate. Methods: Recently, new classes of disorder-immune optical systems have been explored within the framework of topological photonics. Here we explore disorder-robust topological arrays of Mie-resonant nanoparticles for polarization control of photoluminescence of nanocrystals. Results: We demonstrate polarized emission from rareearth-doped nanocrystals governed by photonic topological edge states supported by zigzag arrays of dielectric resonators. We verify the topological origin of polarized photoluminescence by comparing emission from nanoparticles coupled to topologically trivial and nontrivial arrays of nanoresonators. Conclusions: We expect that our results may open a new direction in the study of topology-enable emission properties of topological edge states in many photonic systems.

ABSTRACT: Topological valley-locked edge state has arisen a rapidly developing research topic in photonics for its gapless dispersion and immunity against intervalley scattering. However, valley-locked edge state is usually confined around the domain walls of valley photonic crystals (VPhCs) with different topological invariants, which de-creases the flexibility of valley photonic devices and limits its application in on-chip integration. Here we propose a topological valley-locked waveguide (TVLW) with a width degree of freedom (DOF) by using a photonic heterostructure where a VPhC characterized by Dirac cones is sandwiched by two VPhCs with opposite valley Chern numbers. The TVLW is available for the transmission of waveguide states which maintain the properties of momentum-valley locking and robustness to defects. Taking advantage of these properties of TVLWs, we design a topological energy concentrator for field enhancement and a topological power splitter with an arbitrary splitting ratio by introducing the rotation angle of channels as a new DOF. Compared with conventional waveguides, the proposed TVLWs with tunable mode-width are more flexible to interface with the existing photonic devices, which provide broad application prospects in on-chip communication and photonic integrated networks.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics holds the promise for enhanced robustness of light localization and propagation enabled by the global symmetries of the system. While traditional designs of topological structures rely on lattice symmetries, there is an alternative strategy based on accidentally degenerate modes of the individual meta-atoms. Using this concept, we experimentally realize topological edge state in an array of silicon nanostructured waveguides, each hosting a pair of degenerate modes at telecom wavelengths. Exploiting the hybrid nature of the topological mode, we implement its coherent control by adjusting the phase between the degenerate modes and demonstrating selective excitation of bulk or edge states. The resulting field distribution is imaged via third harmonic generation showing the localization of topological modes as a function of the relative phase of the excitations. Our results highlight the impact of engineered accidental degeneracies on the formation of topological phases, extending the opportunities stemming from topological nanophotonic systems.

Particularly, owing to their nonlinear optical properties, fast recovery time, and broadband operation, nanomaterials are well qualified as saturable absorbers in ultrafast pulsed lasers. Over the development of the past decades, various nanomaterials have been developed as saturable absorbers, which contribute to a diversity of lasers with excellent performance.

ABSTRACT: The rapid development of topological photonics and acoustics calls for accurate understanding of band topology in classical waves, which is not yet achieved in many situations. Here, we present the Wilson-loop approach for exact numerical calculation of the topological invariants for several photonic/sonic crystals. We demonstrate that these topological photonic/sonic crystals are topological crystalline insulators with fragile topology, a feature which has been ignored in previous studies. We further discuss the bulk-edge correspondence in these systems with emphasis on symmetry broken on the edges.

ABSTRACT: "Exploring topological phases of matter and their exotic physics appeared as a rapidly growing field of study in solid-state electron systems in the past decade. In recent years, there has been a trend on the emulation of topological insulators/semimetals in many other systems, including ultracold quantum gases, trapped ions, photonic, acoustic, mechanical, and electrical circuit systems. Among these platforms, topological circuits made of simple capacitive and inductive circuit elements emerged as a very competitive platform because of its highly controllable degrees of freedom, lowercost, easy implementation, and great flexibility for integration. Owing to the unique advantages of electrical circuits such as arbitrary engineering of long-range hopping, convenient realization of nonlinear, nonreciprocal, and gain effects, highly flexible measurement, many of the nonlinear, non-abelian, and non-Hermitian physics can be potentially realized and investigated using the electrical circuit platform. In this review, we provide the first short overview of the main achievements of topological circuits developed in the past six years, primarily focusing on their theoretical modeling, circuit construction, experimental characterization, and their distinction from their counterparts in quantum electronics and photonics. The scope of this review covers a wide variety of topological circuits, including Hermitian topological circuits hosting nontrivial edge state, higher-order corner state, Weyl particles  higher dimensional topological circuits exhibiting nodal link and nodal knot states  non-Hermitian topological circuits showing skin effects, gain and loss induced nontrivial edge state  self-induced topological edge state in nonlinear topological circuit  topological circuit having non-Abelian gauge potential."

ABSTRACT: In recent years, it has been discovered that topological photonics can ensure the robust optical behaviors of multiple optical devices, which eases the impact of defects and other perturbations on the device performance. Therefore, the combination of topological photonics and filter design is on demand. Recently, the transmission efficiency equation in a four-terminal cascaded coupled cavities system was derived based on the temporal coupled-mode theory. And general high-order nonreciprocals add/drop filter structure was designed. The simulation results are in good agreement with the theoretical prediction.

ABSTRACT: As an emerging field, nonlinear topological photonics attracts great attention nowadays, where pioneering works show interesting phenomena including topological edge solitons and nonlinearity-induced coupling of light into topological edge states. In this work, the nonlinear effects in a photonic topological insulator in the synthetic space including the frequency axis of light, in a ring resonant array under dynamic modulations are studied, where the four-wave mixing nonlinear process is included. Such nonlinear process not only induces local interactions, but also creates long-range interactions in the frequency dimension. These results show destruction on topologically protected edge states when the nonlinear effects are increasing. Moreover, it also breaks the symmetry in the synthetic space as well as the band structure, which reflects different propagation behaviors for the different input sources with positive and negative frequency shifts and exhibits short-time robustness in weak nonlinear cases. This work hence explores the role of nonlinear effects in affecting the edge modes in the synthetic space, which may be useful in quantum many-body simulations and find possible applications in information processing.

ABSTRACT: Photonic topological states have been exploited to give rise to robust optical behaviors that are quite insensitive to local defects or perturbations, which provide a promising solution for robust photonic integrations. Specifically, for example, optical coupling between waveguides is a universal function in integrated photonics. However, the coupling performance usually suffers from high structure-sensitivity and challenges current manufacturing for massive production. Here, the topological edge state in a finite Su-Schriffer-Heeger modeled optical waveguide array is explored and robust optical coupling (e.g., directional coupling and beam splitting) is demonstrated, which is quite insensitive to structural variations. It is experimentally proved that even a large discrepancy (21-26% structural deviation) in silicon waveguides gaps has little influence on optical coupling (>90% performance), while conventional counterparts totally break down. Moreover, thanks to such a topological design, the devices show much broader working bandwidth (approximate to 10 times performance improvement) than the conventional ones, greatly favoring the photonic integrations. This work would inspire new families of optical devices with robust and broadband properties that can excite more interesting and useful exploration in both fields, and possibly open a new avenue toward topological devices with unique properties and functionalities.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics mimicking topological insulators has recently attracted considerable attention. The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, which is a fundamental topological system, has been experimentally demonstrated in many photonic systems owing to its simplicity. In particular, a zigzag chain, which is described by the SSH model, shows intriguing functionality such as polarization-dependent switching of topological edge states. To date, the far-field imaging of topological edge states in plasmonic chains has not been reported because of the constraint imposed by the diffraction limit. In this study, we experimentally observed the photonic topological edge states of zigzag plasmonic chains composed of metal nanodiscs in the optical region through far-field imaging. Using a chain longer than the diffraction limit, light scattering from the two edges of the zigzag chains was resolved. In the case of such a long chain, it was revealed that tiny gaps of several nanometers between the discs, which are difficult to fabricate, are necessary. Therefore, we propose connected chains and investigate the effect of the shape of the connected part, which reveals that similar topological edge states can be obtained even in the connected chains. The polarization dependence of edge-state imaging showed switching of the systems in trivial and topological phases in the same zigzag chain. Far-field observations serve as an easy and effective tool for the investigation and application of photonic topological edge states.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics offers enhanced control over electromagnetic fields by providing a platform for robust trapping and guiding topological states of light. The topological rainbow can separate and distribute different wavelengths of topological photonic states into different positions, but related topological devices have not yet been fully explored. In this work, topological rainbows are realized by inserting a sandwiched gradient structure in the topological waveguide to realize the topological edge states. A robust one-way slow-light coupling state is realized to broaden the frequency range of the formed topological rainbow with the robust transmission. Thus, multiple topological rainbows are realized by combining the topological property with immunity to backscattering and coupling states of the slow light. Accordingly, light can spread, separate, and thus be trapped at different positions in different directions. This work provides a new way to reconfigure the topological rainbow and brings opportunities to study nanophotonic topological devices.

ABSTRACT: Here we report on the use of liquid crystal topological defects for photonic applications that involve optical singularities. The well-defined molecular organization around a liquid crystal defect enables the coupling between the spin and the orbital angular momentum of light. Such an optical spin-orbit coupling is a general feature of light propagation through inhomogeneous or anisotropic media, which makes liquid crystal topological defects attractive micro-structures when orbital angular momentum of light is the key ingredient of an application.

ABSTRACT: Square-root higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs) are recently discovered new topological phases, with intriguing topological properties inherited from a parent lattice Hamiltonian. Different from conventional HOTIs, the square-root HOTIs typically manifest two paired nonzero energy corner states. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate the second-order square-root HOTIs in photonics for the first time to our knowledge, thereby unveiling such distinct corner states. The specific platform is a laser-written decorated honeycomb lattice (HCL), for which the squared Hamiltonian represents a direct sum of the underlying HCL and breathing Kagome lattice. The localized corner states residing in different bandgaps are observed with characteristic phase structures, in sharp contrast to the discrete diffraction in a topologically trivial structure. Our work illustrates a scheme to study fundamental topological phenomena in systems with the coexistence of spin-1/2 and spin-1 Dirac-Weyl Fermions and may bring about new possibilities in topology-driven photonic devices.

ABSTRACT: Extreme light confinement observed in periodic photonic structures, such as the vortex singularities in momentum (k) space, has been associated with their topological nature. Consequently, by exploiting and tuning their topological properties, optical metasurfaces have been demonstrated as an attractive platform for active photonics. However, given the fact that most active media under external excitations can only provide limited refractive index change, the potential advancements offered by the topological character of active metasurfaces have remained mostly unexplored. Zinc oxide (ZnO), which has recently exhibited optically-induced extraordinarily large permittivity modulations at visible and near-infrared frequencies, is an excellent active material for dynamic metasurfaces exhibiting strong tuning. This work demonstrates that a hybrid metasurface consisting of an array of ZnO nanodisks on a silver backplane displays broadly tunable topological properties. In particular, by performing k-space scattering simulations using measured pump-fluence-dependent material properties of ZnO, we study in detail the light reflection from the hybrid metasurface. Our results validate that the large k-space topology tuning of the metasurface can result in enormously strong polarization manipulation of near-infrared light in the vicinity of the topological features. The observed polarization switching effect is highly sensitive to the polarization and wavelength of an incident wave, owing to the symmetry and dispersion characteristics of the proposed system. Our study indicates that leveraging a combination of the extraordinary material properties and the k-space topology, hybrid metasurfaces based on ZnO may open new avenues for creating all-optical switchable metadevices.

ABSTRACT: Implementation of topology on photonics has opened new functionalities of photonic systems such as topologically protected boundary modes. We theoretically present polarization-dependent topological properties in a 2D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattice by using a metallic nanoparticle array and considering the polarization degree of freedom. We demonstrate that when eigenmodes are polarized parallel to the plane of the 2D lattice, it supports longitudinal edge modes that are isolated from the bulk states and transverse edge modes that are overlapped with the bulk states. Also, the in-plane polarized modes support a second-order topological phase under an open boundary condition by breaking the four-fold rotational symmetry. This work will offer polarization-based multifunctionality in compact photonic systems that have topological features.

ABSTRACT: Robust terahertz wave transport is demonstrated on a silicon chip using the valley Hall topological phase. Error-free communication is achieved at a data rate of 11 Gbit s(-1), enabling real-time transmission of uncompressed 4K high-definition video. The realization of integrated, low-cost and efficient solutions for high-speed, on-chip communication requires terahertz-frequency waveguides and has great potential for information and communication technologies, including sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication, terahertz integrated circuits, and interconnects for intrachip and interchip communication. However, conventional approaches to terahertz waveguiding suffer from sensitivity to defects and sharp bends. Here, building on the topological phase of light, we experimentally demonstrate robust terahertz topological valley transport through several sharp bends on the all-silicon chip. The valley kink states are excellent information carriers owing to their robustness, single-mode propagation and linear dispersion. By leveraging such states, we demonstrate error-free communication through a highly twisted domain wall at an unprecedented data transfer rate (exceeding ten gigabits per second) that enables real-time transmission of uncompressed 4K high-definition video (that is, with a horizontal display resolution of approximately 4,000 pixels). Terahertz communication with topological devices opens a route towards terabit-per-second datalinks that could enable artificial intelligence and cloud-based technologies, including autonomous driving, healthcare, precision manufacturing and holographic communication.

ABSTRACT: The field of topological photonics emerged as one of the most promising areas for applications in transformative technologies: possible applications are in topological lasers or quantum optics interfaces. Nevertheless, efficient and simple methods for diagnosing the topology of optical systems remain elusive for an important part of the community. Herein, a summary of numerical methods to calculate topological invariants emerging from the propagation of light in photonic crystals is provided. The fundamental properties of wave propagation in lattices with a space-dependent periodic electric permittivity is first described. Next, an introduction to topological invariants is provided, proposing an optimal strategy to calculate them through the numerical evaluation of Maxwell's equation in a discretized reciprocal space. Finally, the tutorial is complemented with a few practical examples of photonic crystal systems showing different topological properties, such as photonic valley-Chern insulators, photonic crystals presenting an obstructed atomic limit, photonic systems supporting fragile topology, and finally photonic Chern insulators, where the magnetic permeability is also periodically modulated.

ABSTRACT: Photonic topological structures supporting spin-momentum locked topological states underpin a plethora of prospects and applications for disorder-robust routing of light. One of the cornerstone ideas to realize such states is to exploit uniform bianisotropic response in periodic structures with appropriate lattice symmetries, which together enable the topological bandgap. Here, it is demonstrated that staggered bianisotropic response gives rise to the topological states even in a simple lattice geometry whose counterpart with uniform bianisotropy is topologically trivial. The reason behind this intriguing behavior is in the difference in the effective coupling between the resonant elements with the same and with the opposite signs of bianisotropy. Based on this insight, a one-dimensional (1D) equidistant array is designed, which consists of high-index all-dielectric particles with alternating signs of bianisotropic response. The array possesses chiral symmetry and hosts topologically protected edge states pinned to the frequencies of hybrid magneto-electric modes. These results pave a way toward flexible engineering of topologically robust light localization and propagation by encoding spatially varying bianisotropy patterns in photonic structures.

ABSTRACT: The concept of synthetic dimension has recently emerged as a versatile way to overcome limitations in the number of effectively available dimensions by leveraging non-spatial degrees of freedom to mimic additional geometric ones. In particular, the field of photonics offers a plethora of technological possibilities for controlling photons and their degrees of freedom, such as polarization, frequency, or orbital angular momentum. Consequently, a broad range of higher-dimensional physical phenomena is already experimentally accessible in lower-dimensional photonic devices and has been used and celebrated, for instance, for the exploration of topological physics. The field of synthetic dimensions is currently even further boosted due to additional mathematical mapping procedures, which pave the way toward even higher synthetic dimensions or, in the presence of optical nonlinearities, can translate to multi-particle quantum systems, allowing appealing alternatives for quantum simulation. In this perspective, current experimental approaches for harnessing synthetic dimensions to probe higher-dimensional physics on various light-based platforms are summarized and discussed including an outlook on promising future prospects in this field.

ABSTRACT: Topologically phases, characterized by topological invariants of bulk energy bands, provide remarkable capability to robustly control the propagation of electrons, photons, and phonons. The recently reported higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs) have shown that not only surface and edge states, but also localized corner states can be topologically protected. So far, most realizations of photonic HOTIs are based on lumped circuit components or bulky structures (assume infinite height) with confining metallic plates, which are not suitable for practical integrated photonics applications. Here, we show possible HOTIs' metasurface designs using patterned flat plasmonic sheets as well as thin slabs of all-dielectric photonic crystals based on square and kagome lattices. The structures support both gapped one-dimensional edge states and in-gap zero-dimensional corner states. The non-trivial topology of the bands is characterized by 2D Zak phase (bulk polarization) and the presence of the topological modes is determined in a dimensional hierarchy according to bulk-edge-corner correspondence. The higher-order phases can be understood as the result of the interplay of localization mechanisms along two dimensions. Topological transitions are realized by tweaking the arrangement of the constituent atoms of the unit cell, which changes the intra/inter-cell coupling strengths and the symmetry of the lattice/interface. Our work opens the door for robust localized cavity as well as guided edge modes on scalable, integrated photonic platforms, which feature improved control of light-matter interactions. Additionally, since the proposed structures are open-boundary, this allows for greater degree of flexibility and direct experimental studies of classical topological states using near-field scanning technique.

ABSTRACT: We report a photonic ring resonator structure in the terahertz (THz) regime based on a topological framework to explore the role of different defect states on the high Q-factor (similar to 1200) resonance modes. The simulated transmission result shows a resonance redshift of 10 GHz due to the introduction of a defect state. Such high Q-factor resonance can be used in nonlinear optics and for the development of advanced photonic integrated circuits.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics provides an important platform for the development of photonic devices with robust disorder-immune light transport and controllable helicity. Mixing photons with excitons (or polaritons) gives rise to nontrivial polaritonic bands with chiral modes, allowing the manipulation of helical lasers in strongly coupled light-matter systems. In this work, helical polariton lasing from topological valleys of an organic anisotropic microcrystalline cavity based on tailored local nontrivial band geometry is demonstrated. This polariton laser emits light of different helicity along different angular directions. The significantly enhanced chiral characteristics are achieved by the nonlinear relaxation process. Helical topological polariton lasers may provide a perfect platform for the exploration of novel topological phenomena that involve light-matter interaction and the development of polariton-based spintronic devices.

ABSTRACT: Topological insulators possess protected boundary states which are robust against disorders and have immense implications in both fermionic and bosonic systems. Harnessing these topological effects in nonequilibrium scenarios is highly desirable and has led to the development of topological lasers. The topologically protected boundary states usually lie within the bulk bandgap, and selectively exciting them without inducing instability in the bulk modes of bosonic systems is challenging. Here, we consider topological parametrically driven nonlinear resonator arrays that possess complex eigenvalues only in the edge modes in spite of the uniform pumping. We show parametric oscillation occurs in the topological boundary modes of one and two dimensional systems as well as in the corner modes of a higher order topological insulator system. Furthermore, we demonstrate squeezing dynamics below the oscillation threshold, where the quantum properties of the topological edge modes are robust against certain disorders. Our work sheds light on the dynamics of weakly nonlinear topological systems driven out-of-equilibrium and reveals their intriguing behavior in the quantum regime.

ABSTRACT: Time-domain dynamic evolution properties of topological states play an important role in both fundamental physics study and practical applications of topological photonics. However, owing to the absence of available ultrafast time-domain dynamic characterization methods, studies have mostly focused on the frequency-domain-based properties, and there are few reports demonstrating the time-domain-based properties. Here, we measured the dynamic near-field responses of plasmonic topological structures of gold nanochains with the configuration of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model by using ultrahigh spatial-temporal resolution photoemission electron microscopy. The dephasing time of plasmonic topological edge states increases with increasing the bulk lattice number that has a threshold requirement and finally reaches saturation. We directly revealed through simulation that there is a transient bulk state in the evolution of topological edge states, that is, the energy undergoes relaxation from oscillation between the bulk lattice and the edge. This work shows a new perspective of time-domain dynamic topological photonics.

ABSTRACT: Higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs) are insulators that have novel topological boundary states on the hinges and corners. Herein, we generalize them to photonic HOTIs beyond conventional scalar coupling by considering the dipolar breathing Kagome lattice. The photonic Kagome lattice supports out-of-plane and inplane modes through tensorial dipole-dipole interaction. The topological properties of both modes are protected by generalized chiral symmetry. We demonstrate that the topological modes of the out-of-plane mode are similar to those of scalar models. Interestingly, in addition to in-plane corner states in the lower gap, the in-plane mode hosts multiple gapless symmetric and antisymmetric hinge modes along or transversal to the zigzag and armchair boundaries. These features have no counterparts in scalar models. Our findings demonstrate that photonic HOTIs have richer physics compared with their scalar counterparts, offering opportunities for engineering novel electromagnetic applications with topological constraints.

ABSTRACT: We review and discuss recent progress in the field of nematic colloids, with an emphasis on possible future applications in photonics. The role of the topology is described, based on experimental manipulations of the topological defects in nematic colloids. The topology of the ordering field in nematics provides the forces between colloidal particles that are unique to these materials. We also discuss recent progress in the new field of active microphotonic devices based on liquid crystals (LCs), where chiral nematic microlasers and tuneable nematic microresonators are just two of the recently discovered examples. We conclude that the combination of topology and microphotonic devices based on LCs provides an interesting platform for future progress in the field of LCs.

ABSTRACT: Photonic topological insulators are systems in which the propagation of their edge states is robust to scattering and reflection. Usually, topological systems are discussed in a lossless system, where the dynamics is Hermitian. Here, we investigate, theoretically and numerically, the topological edge states as feed lines to antenna arrays, a way to leak energy out of the system, in a controlled and efficient way. We use the reflection-free property of the edge states to overcome entirely the issue of impedance matching and show how the design of a leaky wave antenna array, made by cascading several antenna ports one after the other, can be made significantly simpler when reflection is completely avoided. Finally, we consider the extension of our results to photonic systems that are time-invariant, in which the topological protection is weak and edge modes are reflection-free only to a certain class of defects.

ABSTRACT: Recent advances in silicon ring-resonator arrays have stimulated the development of topological lattices for photons, with potential applications in integrated photonic devices. Taking inspiration from ultracold atoms, we propose how such arrays can be extended into an additional synthetic dimension by coupling together the different modes of each ring resonator.(1) In this way, a 1D resonator chain can become an effective 2D system, while a 3D resonator array can be exploited as a 4D photonic lattice. As an example of the power of this approach, we discuss how to experimentally realise an optical analogue of the 4D quantum Hall effect for the first time. This opens up the way towards the exploration of higher-dimensional lattices in integrated photonics.

ABSTRACT: Effective medium theory lays the foundation for the development of metamaterials-artificially engineered photonic medium with subwavelength building blocks. However, the nonlocal effects, which are difficult to be incorporated into the effective medium description, are usually unavoidable in most metamaterial systems due to the finite lattice constant, preventing a precise modeling of wave propagation inside a metamaterial of large scale. On the other hand, recent development shows that nonlocal effect is essential for designing certain topological photonic systems such as ideal Weyl metamaterial. The properties of topological metamaterials rely on nonlocal effects, which, for example, determine whether a Weyl degeneracy formed by the linear crossing between a longitudinal and a transverse mode belongs to type I or type II. Here a nonlocal effective medium description of topological metamaterials is developed. For the first time, it is possible to calculate the wave propagation inside this complex medium in a large-scale based on general numerical programs. To show the potential of the approach, wave propagation inside and at the boundary of a photonic ideal Weyl system are thoroughly studied in this work. By reformulating the electric field equation, the method paves the way toward comprehensive engineering of metamaterials with unrestricted nonlocality.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics is an emerging field in photonics in which various topological and geometrical ideas are used to manipulate and control the behavior of light photons. The interplay between topological matter and the spin degree of freedom of photons provides new opportunities for achieving spin-based photonics applications. In this paper, the photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE) of reflected light from the surface of the topological silicene quantum systems subjected to external electric and radiation fields in the terahertz regime is theoretically investigated. By tuning the external electric and the applied laser fields, we can drive the silicenic system through different topological quantum phase transitions. We demonstrate that the in-plane and transverse spatial spin dependent shifts exhibit extreme values near Brewster's angles and away from the optical transition frequencies. We reveal that the photonic spin Hall shifts are sensitive to the spin and valley indices as well as to the number of closed gaps. We believe that the spin and valley-resolved PSHE will greatly impact the research in spinoptics, spintronics, and valleytronics.

ABSTRACT: Inspired by the exciting discovery of topological insulators in condensed-state physics, some topo-logical physics phenomena, such as integer quantum Hall effect, quantum spin Hall effect, topological semi-metals and higher order topological insulators, have successively realized in photonic system. Thanks to the clean energy band, simple design and accurate production of samples, the optical system has gradually become an important platform for studying physical topological models and novel topological phenomena. Topological photonics provides new methods to manipulate light fields and photons. The topological protected edge states can realize the propagation of photons which immune to material defects and impurity. Such ideal transport states are unprecedented in traditional optics, which may lead to radical changes in novel integrated optical devices. In this review, based on the two-dimensional optical system, we briefly introduce the exciting developments of topological photonics, such as photonic integer quantum Hall effect, photonic quantum spin Hall effect, photonic Floquet topological insulators, topological Anderson insulators and photonic higher order topological insulators. We focus on the topological insulators mentioned above and its topological model and novel topological phenomena. Finally, we conclude with the novel topological effects in optics and their applications in novel optical device.

ABSTRACT: Apart from conventional materials, the study of two-dimensional (2D) materials has emerged as a significant field of study for a variety of applications. Graphene-like 2D materials are important elements of potential optoelectronics applications due to their exceptional electronic and optical properties. The processing of these materials towards the realization of devices has been one of the main motivations for the recent development of photonics and optoelectronics. The recent progress in photonic devices based on graphene-like 2D materials, especially topological insulators (TIs) and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with the methodology level discussions from the viewpoint of state-of-the-art designs in device geometry and materials are detailed in this review. We have started the article with an overview of the electronic properties and continued by highlighting their linear and nonlinear optical properties. The production of TIs and TMDs by different methods is detailed. The following main applications focused towards device fabrication are elaborated: (1) photodetectors, (2) photovoltaic devices, (3) light-emitting devices, (4) flexible devices and (5) laser applications. The possibility of employing these 2D materials in different fields is also suggested based on their properties in the prospective part. This review will not only greatly complement the detailed knowledge of the device physics of these materials, but also provide contemporary perception for the researchers who wish to consider these materials for various applications by following the path of graphene.

ABSTRACT: Time-varying media have recently emerged as a new paradigm for wave manipulation, due to the synergy between the discovery of highly nonlinear materials, such as epsilon-near-zero materials, and the quest for wave applications, such as magnet-free nonreciprocity, multimode light shaping, and ultrafast switching. In this review, we provide a comprehensive discussion of the recent progress achieved with photonic metamaterials whose properties stem from their modulation in time. We review the basic concepts underpinning temporal switching and its relation with spatial scattering and deploy the resulting insight to review photonic time-crystals and their emergent research avenues, such as topological and non-Hermitian physics. We then extend our discussion to account for spatiotemporal modulation and its applications to nonreciprocity, synthetic motion, giant anisotropy, amplification, and many other effects. Finally, we conclude with a review of the most attractive experimental avenues recently demonstrated and provide a few perspectives on emerging trends for future implementations of time-modulation in photonics.

ABSTRACT: Topological edge states (TESs), arising from topologically nontrivial phases, provide a powerful toolkit for the architecture design of photonic integrated circuits, since they are highly robust and strongly localized at the boundaries of topological insulators. It is highly desirable to be able to control TES transport in photonic implementations. Enhancing the coupling between the TESs in a finite-size optical lattice is capable of exchanging light energy between the boundaries of a topological lattice, hence facilitating the flexible control of TES transport. However, existing strategies have paid little attention to enhancing the coupling effects between the TESs through the finite-size effect. Here, we establish a bridge linking the interaction between the TESs in a finite-size optical lattice using the Landau-Zener model so as to provide an alternative way to modulate/control the transport of topological modes. We experimentally demonstrate an edge-to-edge topological transport with high efficiency at telecommunication wavelengths in silicon waveguide lattices. Our results may power up various potential applications for integrated topological photonics.

ABSTRACT: Implementing concepts of topological protection in photonics has proved to be an exciting new degree of freedom for the realization of photonic devices. In this work, we are using arrays of coupled microresonators to realize exciton-polariton lasing from a topological domain boundary defect in an orbital Su-Schrieffer-Heeger geometry. By implementing adequate doping levels and the application of a bias voltage, we show that we can use the quantum confined Stark effect to control the condensation of polaritons in the topological mode. Specifically, we demonstrate that we can influence the polariton condensation behavior such that we can switch lasing from the topological defect to a trivial mode. We believe that successfully triggering the crossover from the topologically protected to the trivial regime of a nonlinear Bosonic condensate via eletro-optical methods paves the way toward ultrafast, topologically protected photonic switches, possibly down to the single photon level. Furthermore, we anticipate that a periodic electro-optical modulation can establish a new degree of freedom to tailor the optical properties of topologically protected polariton condensates.

ABSTRACT: Photonic crystal topological insulators host protected states at their edges. In the band structure these edge states appear as continuous bands crossing the photonic band gap. They allow light to propagate unidirectionally and without scattering. In practice it is essential tomake devices relying on these effects asminiature as possible. Here we study photonic topological insulator particles (finite crystals). In such particles the edge state frequencies are discrete. Nevertheless, the discrete states support pseudospin-dependent unidirectional propagation. They allow light to bend around sharp corners similarly to the continuous edge states and act as topologically protected whispering gallery modes, which can store and filter light as well as manipulate its angular momentum. Though we consider a particular all-dielectric realization that does not require a magnetic field, the results in the findings are general, explaining multiple experimental observations of discrete transmission peaks in photonic topological insulators.

ABSTRACT: Marriage of the concepts of parity-time (PT) symmetry and topology recently gave rise to PT-symmetric topological photonics, triggering great interest in the community of photonics. This work reveals PT-symmetric phase transition in second-order topological photonic systems: the photonic systems consisting of square lattice topological photonic crystals with balanced gain and loss support the corner states, two of which are in thresholdless PT broken phase and the other two exhibit PT phase transition with a threshold determined by the coupling strength between the corner modes. The main advantage of the proposed photonic system is the significantly high gain contrast between the corner states and unnecessary background modes originating from bulk and edge ones, enabling diverse photonic applications such as nanolasing with significantly high power compared with the preceding topological nanolasers made of only gain sublattices. The results presented in this work pave the way toward potential applications such as biological sensing and spectroscopy at the nanoscale.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics has recently been proven as a robust framework for manipulating light. Active topological photonic systems, in particular, enable richer fundamental physics by employing nonlinear light-matter interactions, thereby opening a new landscape for applications such as topological lasing. Here we propose an all-dielectric topological insulator laser scheme in the telecommunication region based on semiconductor cavities formed by topologically distinct Kagome photonic crystals. Our theoretical results show that the proposed planar semiconductor Kagome lattice can lift degeneracy with geometrical perturbation and open broad photonic bandgaps, and valley-dependent edge states and topologically robust transport with subwavelength scale confinement are observed at the edge of the perturbed Kagome lattices with distinct valley Chern numbers. An interesting feature of the Kagome lattices is that it supports two different types of valley Hall edge modes, which enables the coexistence of high Qring-resonator modes and lossy Fabry-Perot resonator modes in the proposed topological cavities. Moreover, we explore pumping and lasing dynamics of the topological cavities by means of a four-level two-electron model and demonstrate that this model offers a powerful platform to investigate non-Hermitian topological laser cavities with arbitrary geometry. The proposed topological semiconductor scheme provides a new route to study non-Hermitian topological photonics and to develop integrated topological systems for robust light generation and transport.

ABSTRACT: Topological interface states are formed when two photonic crystals with overlapping band gaps are brought into contact. In this work, we show a planar binary structure with such an interface state in the visible spectral region. Furthermore, we incorporate a thin layer of an active organic material into the structure, providing gain under optical excitation. We observe a transition from fluorescence to lasing under sufficiently strong pump energy density. These results are the first realization of a planar topological laser, based on a topological interface state instead of a cavity like most of other laser devices. We show that the topological nature of the resonance leads to a so-called topological protection, i.e. stability against layer thickness variations as long as inversion symmetry is preserved: even for large changes in thickness of layers next to the interface, the resonant state remains relatively stable, enabling design flexibility superior to conventional planar microcavity devices.

ABSTRACT: Topological phases appearing in photonic systems have recently attracted much attention in the community of photonics due to the fundamental and practical significances. Despite extensive investigations, the preceding results show that the photonic systems exhibit single topological phases with few exceptions. This work presents the simultaneous appearance of different topological phases in a single photonic crystal structure, which are characterized by bulk polarization and valley-Chern number. Square-lattice photonic crystals with unit cells consisting of four dielectric rods, one of which has the size different from the other three ones, exhibit the topological phase characterized by bulk polarization in the first bandgap, depending on the distance between the dielectric rods. Due to the broken inversion symmetry, in the meantime, the photonic systems show the valley-Hall topological phase in the fourth bandgap. The proposed structures have the advantage of flexible design for generating the dual-band topological edge and corner states compared with other photonic systems exhibiting single topological phases. From the fundamental and practical significances, the presented results will trigger the extensive investigations for exploring the photonic systems with multiple topological phases and find important practical applications.

ABSTRACT: Floquet engineering provides an amazing way to reshape materials from topologically trivial to non-trivial phases by exerting periodic drives. Among its vast investigations spanning various physical systems, the toolkit via driving on-site potentials only is rarely employed. Here, a Floquet protocol that switches a simple lattice into a non-trivial topological phase merely by driving its on-site potentials is proposed. Non-trivial topology arises from unpaired Floquet drives. Topological zero-quasienergy states are found at boundaries between non-trivial and trivial structures, being protected by sublattice symmetry. These states are experimentally demonstrated in a photonic platform. This approach can be extended to unveil more novel topological phenomena as well as to endow non-trivial properties to a host of materials.

ABSTRACT: Floquet engineering provides an amazing way to reshape materials from topologically trivial to non-trivial phases by exerting periodic drives. Among its vast investigations spanning various physical systems, the toolkit via driving on-site potentials only is rarely employed. Here, a Floquet protocol that switches a simple lattice into a non-trivial topological phase merely by driving its on-site potentials is proposed. Non-trivial topology arises from unpaired Floquet drives. Topological zero-quasienergy states are found at boundaries between non-trivial and trivial structures, being protected by sublattice symmetry. These states are experimentally demonstrated in a photonic platform. This approach can be extended to unveil more novel topological phenomena as well as to endow non-trivial properties to a host of materials.

ABSTRACT: Valley-Hall photonic topological insulators (VPTIs) provide an intriguing approach to suppress backscattering, enhance the robustness of transport, and shrink the footprints of the topological devices. However, previous works focused on the transmission characteristics of the symmetric topological waveguides with few reports on functional devices involving edge mode coupling, which hinders the implementation of various functional devices such as optical couplers/splitters, switches, filters, and etc. In this paper, a new method to manipulate the mode field distributions in topological waveguides is demonstrated by introducing asymmetric edge states, thus the mode coupling with an arbitrary coupling ratio can be achieved between topological waveguides. As an example, a topological power splitter with a 33:67 splitting ratio is demonstrated experimentally. In addition, to verify the robust transmission property of the topological photonic devices, a high-speed data transmission experiment for a topological power splitter is performed and a high data rate of 128 Gb s(-1) is achieved. These results promise a new method to manipulate the mode field distribution in topological waveguides and devices that may find wide applications in diverse fields such as optical communications, nanophotonics, and quantum information processing.

ABSTRACT: An all-Si photonic structure emulating the quantum-valley-Hall effect is proposed. We show that it acts as a photonic topological insulator (PTI), and that an interface between two such PTIs can support edge states that are free from scattering. The conservation of the valley degree of freedom enables efficient in- and out-coupling of light between the free space and the photonic structure. The topological protection of the edge waves can be utilized for designing arrays of resonant time-delay photonic cavities that do not suffer from reflections and cross-talk.

ABSTRACT: Strongly enhanced third-harmonic generation (THG) by the topological localization of an edge mode in a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain of silicon photonic crystal nanocavities is demonstrated. The edge mode of the nanocavity chain not only naturally inherits resonant properties of the single nanocavity, but also exhibits the topological feature with mode robustness extending well beyond individual nanocavity. By engineering the SSH nanocavities with alternating strong and weak coupling strengths on a silicon slab, the edge mode formation that entails a strong THG signal similar to that obtained from a single nanocavity is observed, which both show three orders of magnitude enhancement compared with that in a trivial SSH structure. The results indicate that the photonic crystal nanocavity chain can provide a promising on-chip platform for topology-driven nonlinear photonics.

ABSTRACT: Topological concepts have been applied to a wide range of fields in order to successfully describe the emergence of robust edge modes that are unaffected by scattering or disorder. In photonics, indications of lasing from topologically protected modes with improved overall laser characteristics were observed. Here, we study exciton-polariton microcavity traps that are arranged in a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattice and form a topological defect mode from which we unequivocally observe highly coherent polariton lasing. Additionally, we confirm the excitonic contribution to the polariton lasing by applying an external magnetic field. These systematic experimental findings of robust lasing and high temporal coherence are meticulously reproduced by a combination of a generalized Gross-Pitaevskii model and a Lindblad master equation model. Thus, by using the comparatively simple SSH geometry, we are able to describe and control the exciton-polariton topological lasing, allowing for a deeper understanding of topological effects on microlasers.

ABSTRACT: Recently, topologically engineered photonic structures have garnered significant attention, as their eigenstates may offer a new insight on photon manipulation and an unconventional route for nanophotonic devices with unprecedented functionalities and robustness. Herein, we present lasing actions at all hierarchical eigenstates that can exist in a topologically designed single two-dimensional (2D) photonic crystal (PhC) platform: 2D bulk, one-dimensional edge, and zero-dimensional corner states. In particular, multiple topological eigenstates are generated in a hierarchical manner with no bulk multipole moment. The unit cell of the topological PhC structure is a tetramer composed of four identical air holes perforated into an InGaAsP multiple-quantum-well epilayer slab. A square area of a topologically nontrivial PhC structure is surrounded by a topologically trivial counterpart, resulting in multidimensional eigenstates of one bulk, four side edges, and four corners within and at the boundaries. Spatially resolved optical excitation spontaneously results in lasing actions at all nine hierarchical topological states. Our experimental findings may provide insight into the development of sophisticated next-generation nanophotonic devices and robust integration platforms.

ABSTRACT: Two dimensional artificial metamaterials, represented by metasurfaces, could control the amplitude, phase, polarization and orbital angular momentum of light, through tailoring the interaction between light and matter. Nowadays, two dimensional artificial metamaterials with nontrivial topological properties have become research focus in optics due to their advantages in robust unidirectional transmission. The topological phase is not only a new degree of freedom to describe matter in the field of condensed matter physics, but also a new parameter to describe optical properties of artificial metamaterials. In this review, the origin of topological photonics and classification for topological properties of two dimensional metamaterials are introduced. The latest progress in topological photonics has also been presented. The summary and prospect of topological metamaterials are given at the end of the review.

ABSTRACT: Recently, artificial photonic structures that exhibit nontrivial topological properties have attracted growing attention due to their capability of achieving one-way backscatter immune transport of light. While photonic crystals are predominantly employed for achieving nontrivial topologies, effective medium approach based on metamaterials has been recently proposed for realizing topologically protected unidirectional surface states. In this article, a microscopic model to investigate the transmission of topological metamaterial grating is constructed based on the scattering processes involving unidirectional surface states. The numerically simulated transmission efficiency of the grating can be precisely reproduced by the model. The model demonstrates that the sharp transmission resonance of the grating results from the constructive interference of the topologically protected one-way surface states. The present work provides an intuitive picture for understanding the scattering processes and resonance behaviors of the topologically protected one-way surface states. Benefitting from the sharp spectral features of the supported resonances, the proposed grating structure may be potentially used for sensing applications.

ABSTRACT: Mode tapering, or the gradual manipulation of the size of some mode, is a requirement for any system that aims to efficiently interface two or more subsystems of different mode sizes. While high-efficiency tapers have been demonstrated, they often come at the cost of a large device footprint or challenging fabrication due to backscattering or excitation of higher-order modes. Topological photonics, offering robustness to certain types of disorder as well as chirality, has proved to be a well-suited design principle for numerous applications in recent years. Here we present a new kind of mode taper realized through topological band gap engineering. We numerically demonstrate a 6-fold change in mode width over an extremely compact 8 mu m distance with near unity efficiency in the optical domain. With suppressed backscattering and no excitation of higher-order modes, such a taper could enable new progress in the development of scalable, multicomponent systems in classical and quantum optics.

We discuss the robustness of these states, highlighting their rich potential for nanophotonic and quantum optics applications.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonic systems offer light transport that is robust against defects and disorder, promising a new generation of chip-scale photonic devices and facilitating energy-efficient on-chip information routing and processing. However, present quasi one dimensional (1D) designs, such as the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and Rice-Mele models, support only a limited number of nontrivial phases due to restrictions on dispersion band engineering. Here, a flexible topological photonic lattice on a silicon photonic platform is experimentally demonstrated that realizes multiple topologically nontrivial dispersion bands. By suitably setting the couplings between the 1D waveguides, different lattices can exhibit the transition between multiple different topological phases and allow the independent realization of the corresponding edge states. Heterodyne measurements clearly reveal the ultrafast transport dynamics of the edge states in different phases at a femtosecond scale, validating the designed topological features. The study equips topological models with enriched edge dynamics and considerably expands the scope to engineer unique topological features into photonic, acoustic, and atomic systems.

ABSTRACT: Robustness against structural disorder or defects is a fascinating feature of topological photonic systems, trig-gering the extensive investigations in modern photonics. Recently, the marriage of topological photonics and fiber optics resulted in a new research direction of photonics with promising applications. In this work, we propose a new type of topological photonic crystal fiber (PCF) with guiding topological corner mode, which has near-zero flattened dispersion. Due to the design flexibility of the fiber cross-section and topological robustness of waveguiding modes, the topological PCF exhibits near-zero flattened dispersion immune to structural disorder and defects at telecommunication wavelength for proper structural parameters. In the dispersion-flattened to-pological PCFs, symmetric supercontinuum (SC) and frequency comb based on four-wave mixing (FWM) span-ning from 1300 nm to 1800 nm can be generated for short fiber lengths in the range of 1-1.5 m. The presented results will broaden the applications of topological PCFs for nonlinear fiber optics due to the structural defects -immunity.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonic structures in analogy to their electronic counterparts can provide new functionalities in nanophotonics. In particular, they can possess topologically protected photonic modes that can propagate unidirectionally without scattering and can have an extreme photonic density of states (PDOS). These unique properties can directly impact many photonic systems in optical communications and in quantum information processing applications such as single photon transport. In analogy to spin Hall effect in electronics, photonic systems can exhibit helicity or pseudo-spin dependent light transport. Below we describe such a system in a honeycomb two-dimensional hole-array photonic crystal. Enabling such properties at optical frequencies and on chip-scale will be very important for practical applications of such phenomena.

ABSTRACT: Photonic topological valley kink states have become a significant research frontier with a plethora of applications. Unlike the guided modes with adjustable widths in conventional waveguides, the valley kink states are usually highly confined around the domain walls. They thus lack the mode width degree of freedom (DOF), posing a serious limitation to potential device applications. Here, by adding a photonic crystal (PhC) featuring Dirac points between two valley PhCs with opposite valley-Chern numbers, we design and experimentally demonstrate topological valley-locked waveguides (TVLWs) with tunable mode widths. The valley-locked waveguide modes are directly visualized via a near-field scan. Moreover, the photonic TVLWs have some unique applications, such as high-energy-capacity topological channel intersections, valley-locked energy concentrators, and topological cavities with designable confinement, as verified numerically and experimentally. The TVLWs with width DOF could be beneficial for interfacing with the existing photonic waveguides and devices, and may serve as a novel platform for practical use of topological lasing, field enhancement, and high-capacity energy transport.

ABSTRACT: We propose a two-dimensional (2D) triple-site honeycomb lattice (TSHL) photonic crystal (PC) by rotating the three dielectric rods six times, forming unit cell, and then arraying the unit cells in the triangular lattice. The TSHL PC structure can achieve topological phase transitions in three ways, which are changing the position or size of the rods, and rotating the rods. By calculating the band structure under different parameters, the law of topological phase transition for TSHL PC is analyzed. The topological edge state can be adjusted by changing the rotation angle of the dielectric rods. Based on this, a frequency-selective beam splitter is designed. Compared with previous studies, this flexible topological system shows more abundant physical phenomena, enriches the implementation of topological photonics, and promotes the research of topological edge states and the development of topological insulators in practical applications.

In this article, we review the fundamental physics and applications of topological polarization singularities, which are defined upon the far-field radiation of photonic systems and characterized by topological charges as the winding numbers of polarization orientation around a given center. A brief summarizing of topological charge theory is presented. A series of applications related to topological polarization singularities are then discussed.

ABSTRACT: Rapid scaling of semiconductor devices has led to an increase in the number of processor cores and integrated functionalities onto a single chip to support the growing demands of high-speed and large-volume consumer electronics. To meet this burgeoning demand, an improved interconnect capacity in terms of bandwidth density and active tunability is required for enhanced throughput and energy efficiency. Low-loss terahertz silicon interconnects with larger bandwidth offer a solution for the existing inter-/intrachip bandwidth density and energy-efficiency bottleneck. Here, a low-loss terahertz topological interconnect-cavity system is presented that can actively route signals through sharp bends, by critically coupling to a topological cavity with an ultrahigh-quality (Q) factor of 0.2 x 10(6). The topologically protected large Q factor cavity enables energy-efficient optical control showing 60 dB modulation. Dynamic control is further demonstrated of the critical coupling between the topological interconnect-cavity for on-chip active tailoring of the cavity resonance linewidth, frequency, and modulation through complete suppression of the back reflection. The silicon topological cavity is complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible and highly desirable for hybrid electronic-photonic technologies for sixth (6G) generation terahertz communication devices. Ultrahigh-Q cavity also paves the path for designing ultrasensitive topological sensors, terahertz topological integrated circuits, and nonlinear topological photonic devices.

ABSTRACT: The investigation of topological state transition in carefully designed photonic lattices is of high interest for fundamental research, as well as for applied studies such as manipulating light flow in on-chip photonic systems. Herein, the topological phase transition between symmetric topological zero modes (TZM) and antisymmetric TZMs in Su-Schrieffer-Heeger mirror symmetric waveguides is reported. The transition of TZMs is realized by adjusting the coupling ratio between neighboring waveguide pairs, which is enabled by selective modulation of the refractive index in the waveguide gaps. Bidirectional topological transitions between symmetric and antisymmetric TZMs can be achieved with proposed switching strategy. Selective excitation of topological edge mode is demonstrated owing to the symmetry characteristics of the TZMs. The flexible manipulation of topological states is promising for on-chip light flow control and may spark further investigations on symmetric/antisymmetric TZM transitions in other photonic topological frameworks. Herein, the selective excitation of trivial/nontrivial topological states by switching the symmetry of the topological zero modes (TZM) in Su-Schrieffer-Heeger waveguide arrays is reported. Bidirectional topological transitions between symmetric and antisymmetric TZMs can be achieved with proposed strategy. Selective excitation of topological edge mode is demonstrated owing to the symmetry characteristics of the TZMs.image (c) 2023 WILEY-VCH GmbH

ABSTRACT: Liquid crystal colloids are interesting for a variety of mechanisms-including self-assembly, optical-tweezers assisted assembly, topology, and material flow-that can be used to create various complex optical and photonic structures. Here, we present a brief overview of liquid crystal colloidal structures, as recently achieved by numerical modeling and experiments. Central to the structures are complex conformations of topological defects, as they can bind, stabilize, or distort the structure. Using topological and geometrical arguments, we show that the defects can be controllably rewired and imprinted, for example by using optical tweezers. We show that 3D colloidal crystals can be assembled from elastic dipoles of spherical beads in nematic liquid crystals or via inherently inhomogeneous order profiles in bulk and confined cholesteric blue phases. Colloidal crystals are generalized to close-packed colloidal lattices, which we show can serve as natural templates for defect networks. Finally, photonic bands are calculated for selected structures and possible defects in the structure are discussed.

ABSTRACT: We propose the use of artificial neural networks to design and characterize photonic topological insulators. As a hallmark, the band structures of these systems show the key feature of the emergence of edge states, with energies lying within the energy gap of the bulk materials and localized at the boundary between regions of distinct topological invariants. We consider different structures such as one-dimensional photonic crystals, PT-symmetric chains and cylindrical systems and show how, through a machine learning application, one can identify the parameters of a complex topological insulator to obtain protected edge states at target frequencies. We show how artificial neural networks can be used to solve the long-standing quest for a solution to inverse problems solution and apply this to the cutting edge topic of topological nanophotonics.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonic nanocavity provides a robust platform for realizing nano-photonic devices and studying light-matter interaction. Here, a topological photonic-plasmonic hybrid nanocavity, assembling a topological photonic crystal (PhC) nanocavity with a plasmonic nano-antenna, is proposed to have an ultra-high figure of merit Q/V of 1.5x10(6)(lambda/n)(-3) , which is two orders higher than that of the bare topological PhC nanocavity. The single-atom cooperativity parameter is improved by over 60 times due to the large enhancement of Q/V, which makes the coupling between light and a single emitter enter a strong coupling region in topological photonic realm for the first time. Meanwhile, strong coupling and weak coupling can be easily switched in the topological hybrid system by tuning the structure dimension of plasmonic nano-antennas. This work provides a robust platform to control coupling phase transition between light and a single emitter, which has great potential in topological lasers, quantum optics and quantum information.

ABSTRACT: Stable and phase-locked emission in an extended topological supermode of coupled laser arrays, based on concepts of non-Hermitian and topological photonics, is theoretically suggested. A non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain of coupled microring resonators is considered, and it is shown that application of a synthetic imaginary gauge field via auxiliary passive microrings leads to all supermodes of the chain, except one, to become edge states. The only extended supermode, that retains some topological protection, can stably oscillate suppressing all other non-topological edge supermodes. Numerical simulations based on a rate equation model of the semiconductor laser arrays confirm stable anti-phase laser emission in the extended topological supermode and the role of the synthetic gauge field to enhance laser stability.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics has become an active subfield of photonics analogous to the electronic counterpart, and the bulk-edge correspondence leads to robust topologically protected interfacial states. However, a single-topological interface mode with fixed energy cannot be easily manipulated, hindering its applications in optical devices. Here, we study coupled-waveguide arrays mapped to a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger system with two coupled topological interfaces. This configuration greatly increases device versatility and tunability while keeping the confinement of coupled-interface modes inherited from the topological properties nearly intact. Theoretically predicted oscillations between coupled interfaces is experimentally observed. The spatial and energetic isolation of the coupled interface states from the bulk modes is experimentally observed and theoretically confirmed by calculating the degree of localization of the eigenstates, which is found to be comparable to a single-interface state. Finally, a proof-of-principle, all-optical logic circuit is fabricated based on coupled interfaces, demonstrating its potential in assembling on-chip topological optical devices.

ABSTRACT: The bulk-edge correspondence links the Chern topological numbers with the net number of unidirectional states supported at an interface of the relevant materials. This fundamental principle is perhaps the most consequential result of topological photonics, as it determines the precise physical manifestations of nontrivial topological features. Even though the bulk-edge correspondence has been extensively discussed and used in the literature, it seems that in the general photonic case with dispersive materials it has no solid mathematical foundation and is essentially a conjecture. Here, I present a rigorous physically-motivated demonstration of this fundamental principle by showing that the thermal fluctuationinduced light-angular momentum spectral density in a closed cavity can be expressed in terms of the photonic gap Chern number, as well as in terms of the net number of unidirectional edge states. In particular, I highlight the rather fundamental connections between topological numbers in Chern-type photonic insulators and the fluctuation-induced light momentum.

ABSTRACT: Higher-order photonic topological states have recently attracted great attention due to the realizability of photonic nanocavities with high robustness against structural disorder. Herein, it is revealed that square-lattice photonic crystals with L-shaped sublattices exhibit second-order photonic topological phases. In the approximation considering only the nearest-neighbor interactions, the photonic system with an expanded sublattice exhibits topologically nontrivial phase represented by the nonzero polarization, approaching P = ( 1 4 , 1 4 ) in the extreme case, whereas it is trivial for the cases of the shrunken one. Unlike the conventional square lattices with four dielectric rods, the proposed photonic systems have a single corner state for squared topological boundaries, while they exhibit three corner states when they have triangular boundaries. Although the weakly anisotropic systems with the expanded L-shaped sublattices exhibit different corner states, they disappear for a substantial increase of anisotropy. The results obtained in this work enrich the diversity and understanding of higher-order photonic topological systems and pave the way for wide applications of higher-order topological phases in photonics, including coherent nanosources based on nanolasing and nonlinear frequency conversion.

ABSTRACT: 6G communication requires high-speed and advanced functionalities on-chip. Here the authors demonstrate broadband phototunable topological waveguide and demultiplexing chip with record single-channel 160 Gbit/s communication link and excellent channel isolation for 300 GHz band. The revolutionary 5G cellular systems represent a breakthrough in the communication network design to provide a single platform for enabling enhanced broadband communications, virtual reality, autonomous driving, and the internet of everything. However, the ongoing massive deployment of 5G networks has unveiled inherent limitations that have stimulated the demand for innovative technologies with a vision toward 6G communications. Terahertz (0.1-10 THz) technology has been identified as a critical enabler for 6G communications with the prospect of massive capacity and connectivity. Nonetheless, existing terahertz on-chip communication devices suffer from crosstalk, scattering losses, limited data speed, and insufficient tunability. Here, we demonstrate a new class of phototunable, on-chip topological terahertz devices consisting of a broadband single-channel 160 Gbit/s communication link and a silicon Valley Photonic Crystal based demultiplexer. The optically controllable demultiplexing of two different carriers modulated signals without crosstalk is enabled by the topological protection and a critically coupled high-quality (Q) cavity. As a proof of concept, we demultiplexed high spectral efficiency 40 Gbit/s signals and demonstrated real-time streaming of uncompressed high-definition (HD) video (1.5 Gbit/s) using the topological photonic chip. Phototunable silicon topological photonics will augment complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) compatible terahertz technologies, vital for accelerating the development of futuristic 6G and 7G communication era driving the real-time terabits per second wireless connectivity for network sensing, holographic communication, and cognitive internet of everything.

ABSTRACT: Topological physics originated from solid state physics and is used to explain the integer Hall conductivity of boundary states in quantum Hall effect. The boundary state realized by topological theory will naturally have some anti-scattering ability in physical principle. Then, by analogy with condensed matter topology, topological theory is applied to photonics, that is, topological photonics is also proposed, which has gradually become an important photonics principle and method. Its novel way of light field regulation has aroused great interest. As an important branch of metaphotonics, topological photonics theory is used in the design of various optical structures. The sub-wavelength artificial optical metamaterials, e.g., photonic crystals and metasurfaces, are applied to propose and realize various novel optical phenomena, including broadband unidirectional propagation and robust transport in microwave or optical band. This paper focuses on topological photonic crystals. According to its development history, the topological physical properties and design methods of photonic crystals based on the optical analogous of topological features such as the effects of quantum Hall, quantum spin Hall and quantum valley Hall are reviewed. Three kinds of topological photonic crystals are introduced, which use symmetry breaking to split degenerate points and open non-trivial band gap. For example, quantum-Hall photonic crystals break time reversal symmetry by using external magnetic field of gyromagnetic crystals. By introducing the coupling of TE and TM modes into bianisotropic media or metal materials, one can realize quantum-spin-Hall photonic crystals with the degeneracy broken of TE and TM modes. Quantum-valley-Hall photonic crystals break the degeneracy of Dirac points by the inversion symmetry broken of the honeycomb lattice. The bulk-edge correspondence in topological theory is explained , and many practical works to realize the robust edge state of topological photonic crystals in theory or experiment are given. Furthermore, the potential applications of topological photonic crystals in micro-nano integrated photonic and quantum optics devices are analyzed, such as robust transport of optical signals, which can still achieve high transmittance under the condition of sharp bending or structural defects. Topological photonic crystals are used to realize various passive devices, such as optical routing, wavelength division multiplexer, optical beam splitter and optical microcavity. Some active devices, e.g. tunable waveguides, optical switches and laser resonators, are also realized by topological photonic crystals. Topological photonic crystals can be used to design quantum optics devices, including quantum light source and two-photon interference device. At the same time, as another important branch of metaphotonics, metasurfaces have also attracted extensive attention. This paper also briefly introduces the important achievements of metasurfaces in micro-optical imaging. In the future, with the further research on physics principles, optoelectronic design, preparation process, package testing and so on in metamaterials , metaphotonics will become an important part of the new generation of information technology and is expected to have a positive and far-reaching impact on the basic and application fields of silicon optoelectronics, integrated circuits, micro-optical technology, micrography, quantum computing, quantum precision measurement, etc.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics has thrived in various optical systems over the past decade for the fascinating properties of eliminating backscattering losses and enhancing the efficiency of communication systems. The demonstration of topology in strong light-matter coupling regimes may prove tunable optical devices that are immune to disorder and defects or achieve the extreme light confinement. Recently, the topological properties of exciton-polaritons were experimentally studied in deep cryogenic temperatures. As for another elementary quasiparticle in solids, phonon- polaritons, which can remain stable at a high temperature, the relative topological dispersion contours have been observed very recently at room temperatures. Here, we experimentally presented a topological valley transport of terahertz phonon-polaritons in LiNbO3 photonic crystal slab. Topological waveguides with two peculiar interfaces are designed and studied, where the phonon-polaritons are generated through femtosecond laser pulses. We show the intensity distribution and dispersion curves of phonon-polaritons propagating in the topological waveguides at different bended interfaces, in which the topological edge modes make smooth detours. Our work opened a new path toward topological polaritonics at a valley-edge-mode based phonon-polariton platform, which also provides insights to the low loss phonon-polariton chips, strong light-matter interactions, nonlinear topological photonics, and future THz communications.

ABSTRACT: The design of periodic nanostructures allows to tailor the transport of photons, phonons, and matter waves for specific applications. Recent years have seen a further expansion of this field by engineering topological properties. However, what is missing currently are efficient ways to rapidly explore and optimize band structures and to classify their topological characteristics for arbitrary unit-cell geometries. In this work, we show how deep learning can address this challenge. We introduce an approach where a neural network first maps the geometry to a tight-binding model. The tight-binding model encodes not only the band structure but also the symmetry properties of the Bloch waves. This allows us to rapidly categorize a large set of geometries in terms of their band representations, identifying designs for fragile topologies. We demonstrate that our method is also suitable to calculate strong topological invariants, even when (like the Chern number) they are not symmetry indicated. Engineering of domain walls and optimization are accelerated by orders of magnitude. Our method directly applies to any passive linear material, irrespective of the symmetry class and space group. It is general enough to be extended to active and nonlinear metamaterials.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics started out as a pursuit to engineer systems that mimic fermionic single-particle Hamiltonians with symmetry-protected modes, whose number can only change in spectral phase transitions such as band inversions. The paradigm of topological lasing, realized in three recent experiments, offers entirely new interpretations of these states, as they can be selectively amplified by distributed gain and loss. A key question is whether such topological mode selection persists when one accounts for the nonlinearities that stabilize these systems at their working point. Here we show that topological defect lasers can indeed stably operate in genuinely topological states. These comprise direct analogues of zero modes from the linear setting, as well as a novel class of states displaying symmetry-protected power oscillations, which appear in a spectral phase transition when the gain is increased. These effects show a remarkable practical resilience against imperfections, even if these break the underlying symmetries, and pave the way to harness the power of topological protection in nonlinear quantum devices.

ABSTRACT: Photonic topological states have revolutionized the understanding of the propagation and scattering of light. The recent discovery of higher-order photonic topological insulators opens an emergent horizon for 0D topological corner states. However, the previous realizations of higher-order topological insulators in electromagnetic-wave systems suffer from either a limited operational frequency range due to the lumped components involved or a bulky structure with a large footprint, which are unfavorable for achieving compact photonic devices. To overcome these limitations, a planar surface-wave photonic crystal realization of 2D higher-order topological insulators is hereby demonstrated experimentally. The surface-wave photonic crystals exhibit a very large bulk bandgap (a bandwidth of 28%) due to multiple Bragg scatterings and host 1D gapped edge states described by massive Dirac equations. The topology of those higher-dimensional photonic bands leads to the emergence of in-gap 0D corner states, which provide a route toward robust cavity modes for scalable compact photonic devices.

ABSTRACT: We consider periodically modulated Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model with gain and loss. This model, which can be realized with current technology in photonics using waveguides, allows us to study Floquet topological insulating phase. By using Floquet theory, we find the quasi-energy spectrum of this one dimensional PT symmetric topological insulator. We show that stable Floquet topological phase exists in our model provided that oscillation frequency is large and the non-Hermitian degree is below than a critical value. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: In the past few years, the concept of topological matter has inspired considerable research in broad areas of physics. In particular, photonic artificial microstructures like photonic crystals and metamaterials provide a unique platform to investigate topologically non-trivial physics in spin-1 electromagnetic fields. Three-dimensional (3D) topological semimetal band structures, which carry non-trivial topological charges, are fundamental to 3D topological physics. Here, we review recent progress in understanding 3D photonic topological semimetal phases and various approaches for realizing them, especially with photonic crystals or metamaterials. We review topological gapless band structures and topological surface states aroused from the non-trivial bulk topology. Weyl points, 3D Dirac points, nodal lines, and nodal surfaces of different types are discussed. We also demonstrate their application in coupling spin-polarized electromagnetic waves, anomalous reflection, vortex beams generation, bulk transport, and non-Hermitian effects.

ABSTRACT: Photonic waveguide arrays provide an excellent platform for simulating conventional topological systems, and they can also be employed for the study of novel topological phases in photonics systems. However, a direct measurement of bulk topological invariants remains a great challenge. Here we study topological features of generalized commensurate Aubry-Andre-Harper (AAH) photonic waveguide arrays and construct a topological phase diagram by calculating all bulk Chern numbers, and then explore the bulk-edge correspondence by analyzing the topological edge states and their winding numbers. In contrast to incommensurate AAH models, diagonal and off-diagonal commensurate AAH models are not topologically equivalent. In particular, there appear nontrivial topological phases with large Chern numbers and topological phase transitions. By implementing Thouless pumping of light in photonic waveguide arrays, we propose a simple scheme to measure the bulk Chern numbers. [GRAPHICS] .

ABSTRACT: "Topological photonic crystals have received considerable attention for their ability to manipulate and guide light in unique ways. They are typically designed by hand based on the careful analysis of their bands and mode profiles, but recent theoretical advances have revealed new and powerful insights into the connection between band symmetry, connectivity, and topology. Here we propose a combined global and local optimization framework that integrates a flexible symmetry-constrained level-set parametrization with standard gradient-free optimization algorithms to optimize topological photonic crystals, a problem setting where the objective function may be highly nonconvex and noncontinuous. Our framework can be applied to any symmetry-identifiable band topology, and we demonstrate its applicability to several prominent kinds of three-dimensional band topologies, namely, & UGamma enforced nodal lines, Weyl points, and Chern insulators. Requiring no prior examples of topological photonic crystals or prior knowledge on the connection between structure and band topology, our approach indicates a path toward the automated discovery of novel topological photonic crystal designs.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics is an emergent field at the cross of photonics and topological physics which opens our eyes to novel topological phenomena and versatile photonic effects. Photonic crystals (PhCs) are the optical analogs of conventional crystals that have proven to be an excellent photonic platform to explore topological physics. Here, we present a brief review of the all-dielectric topological PhCs by focusing on several prominent milestones of topological phases, such as the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, topological insulators, topological semimetals, and higher order topological phases. For each topological phase, the topological invariants and the intriguing topological properties as well as the potential applications are discussed. We conclude with the current challenge and the prospect of all-dielectric topological PhCs.

ABSTRACT: In this study, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a novel kind of Tamm plasmon topological super-lattice (TTS) by engineering Tamm photonic crystals (TPCs) belonging to a different class of topology. Utilizing specifically designed double-layer metasurfaces etching on planar multilayered photonic structures, the TPC that supports the Tamm plasmon photonic bandgap is realized in the visible regime. Through the coupling of topological interface states existing between different TPCs, hybrid topological interface states of Tamm plasmon, called supermodes, are obtained that can be fully described by a tight-binding model. Meanwhile, we can achieve a tunable bandwidth of supermodes via varying the etching depth difference between double-layer metasurfaces. We show that the bandwidth decreases with the increase of etching depth difference, resulting in a nearly flat dispersion of supermodes with strong localization, regardless of excitation angles. All the results are experimentally verified by measuring angular-resolved reflectance spectra. The TTS and supermodes proposed here open a new pathway for the manipulation of Tamm plasmons based on which various promising applications such as integrated photonic devices, optical sensing, and enhancing light-matter interactions can be realized.

ABSTRACT: The van der Waals layered material MnBi2Te4, as a magnetic topological insulator, has attracted tremendous interest for novel physics research in the fields of condensed matter physics and materials science. However, the nonlinear optical properties of MnBi2Te4 and its applications in ultrafast optics have rarely been explored. In this study, high-quality MnBi2Te4 nanosheets have been successfully synthesized by the self-flux method. The morphology, chemical composition, magnetic properties, and nonlinear optical characteristics were systematically investigated. The magnetic transition of MnBi2Te4 was confirmed by a low-temperature spatially resolved spectroscopic technique. The saturable absorption property of MnBi2Te4 was measured by a balanced twin-detector system with a modulation depth of 4.5% and a saturation optical intensity of 2.35 GW/cm(2). Furthermore, by inserting the MnBi2Te4-based saturable absorber, a soliton mode-locking laser operating at 1558.8 nm was obtained with a pulse duration of 331 fs. This research will pave the way for applications of the magnetic TI MnBi2Te4 in nonlinear optics and photonics.

ABSTRACT: Higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs) represent a new type of topological system, supporting boundary states localized over boundaries, two or more dimensions lower than the dimensionality of the system itself. Interestingly, photonic HOTIs can possess a richer physics than their original condensed matter counterpart, supporting conventional HOTI states based on tight-binding coupling, and a new type of topological HOTI states enabled by long-range interactions. Here, a new mechanism to establish all-dielectric infrared HOTI metasurfaces exhibiting both types of HOTI states is proposed, supported by a topological transition accompanied by the emergence of topological Wannier-type polarization. Two kinds of near-field experimental studies are performed: i) the solid immersion spectroscopy and ii) near-field imaging using scattering scanning near-field optical microscopy to directly observe the topological transition and the emergence of HOTI states of two types. It is shown that the near-field profiles indicate the displacement of the Wannier center across the topological transition leading to the topological dipole polarization and emergence of the topological boundary states. The proposed all-dielectric HOTI metasurface offers a new approach to confine the optical field in micro- and nano-scale topological cavities and thus paves the way to achieve a novel nanophotonic technology.

ABSTRACT: Through employing a cost-effective solvothermal method, ultrathin topological insulator (TI) bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3) nanosheets with uniform hexagonal nanostructures had been synthesized. Thanks to the uniformity of few-layer TI dispersion, we are able to adopt the drop-casting approach in order to directly transfer few-layer TI and, therefore, form a self-assembled uniform volatile TI membrane that is suitably deposited onto the end facet of an optical fiber as an effective optical saturable absorber. Its saturable absorption parameters could be deliberately tailored by thinning its thickness by mechanical exfoliation. The incorporation of the as-fabricated saturable absorber inside the fiber laser cavity allows for the operation of either a microsecond or a femtosecond pulse because different saturable absorption parameters can decide whether the fiber laser operates in the mode-locking or Q-switching state. Our work provides a convenient way of fabricating a high-quality TI membrane-based saturable absorber with promising applications for laser operation.

ABSTRACT: The introduction of topological physics into the field of photonics has led to the development of photonic devices endowed with robustness against structural disorder. While a range of platforms have been successfully implemented demonstrating topological protection of light in the classical domain, the implementation of quantum light sources in photonic devices harnessing topologically nontrivial resonances is largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate a single photon source based on a single semiconductor quantum dot coupled to a topologically nontrivial Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) cavity mode. We provide an in-depth study of Purcell enhancement for this topological quantum light source and demonstrate its emission of nonclassical light on demand. Our approach is a promising step toward the application of topological cavities in quantum photonics.

ABSTRACT: Topological quantum optics that manipulates the topological protection of quantum states has attracted special interests in recent years. Here we demonstrate valley photonic crystals implementing topologically protected transport of the continuous frequency entangled biphoton states. We numerically simulate the nonlinear four-wave mixing interaction of topological valley kink states propagating along the interface between two valley photonic crystals. We theoretically clarify that the signal and idler photons generated from the four-wave mixing interaction are continuous frequency entangled. The numerical simulation results imply that the entangled biphoton states are robust against the sharp bends and scattering, giving clear evidence of topological protection of entangled photon pairs. Our proposal paves a concrete way to perform topological protection of entangled quantum states operating at telecommunication wavelengths.

ABSTRACT: The discovery of topological insulators was rapidly followed by the advent of their photonic analogues, motivated by the prospect of backscattering-immune light propagation. So far, however, implementations have mainly relied on engineering bulk modes in photonic crystals and waveguide arrays in two-dimensional (2D) systems, which closely mimic their electronic counterparts. In addition, metamaterials-based implementations subject to electromagnetic duality and bianisotropy conditions suffer from intricate designs and narrow operating bandwidths. Here, it is shown that symmetry-protected topological states akin to the quantum spin-Hall effect can be realized in a straightforward manner by coupling surface modes over metasurfaces of complementary electromagnetic responses. Specifically, stacking unit cells of such metasurfaces directly results in double Dirac cones of degenerate transverse-electric (TE) and transverse-magnetic (TM) modes, which break into a wide nontrivial bandgap at small interlayer separation. Consequently, the ultrathin structure supports robust gapless edge states, which are confined along a one-dimensional (1D) line rather than a surface interface, as demonstrated at microwave frequencies by near-field imaging. The simplicity and versatility of the proposed approach proves attractive as a tabletop platform for the study of classical topological phases, as well as for applications benefiting the compactness of metasurfaces and the potential of topological insulators.

ABSTRACT: Metals, semiconductors, metamaterials, and various two-dimensional materials with plasmonic dispersion exhibit numerous exotic physical effects in the presence of an external bias, for example an external static magnetic field or electric current. These physical phenomena range from Faraday rotation of light propagating in the bulk to strong confinement and directionality of guided modes on the surface and are a consequence of the breaking of Lorentz reciprocity in these systems. The recent introduction of relevant concepts of topological physics, translated from condensed-matter systems to photonics, has not only given a new perspective on some of these topics by relating certain bulk properties of plasmonic media to the surface phenomena, but has also led to the discovery of new regimes of truly unidirectional, backscattering-immune, surface-wave propagation. In this article, we briefly review the concepts of nonreciprocity and topology and describe their manifestation in plasmonic materials. Furthermore, we use these concepts to classify and discuss the different classes of guided surface modes existing on the interfaces of various plasmonic systems.

ABSTRACT: Spin angular momentum associated with circular polarization is a fundamental and important aspect of photons both in classical and quantum optics. The interaction of this optical spin with matter and structures results in many intriguing optical effects and state-of-the-art applications covered under the emerging subject of spin optics. Distinct from longitudinal optical spin along the mean wavevector, transverse spin, the corresponding vector of which is perpendicular to the mean wavevector, prevails and plays a significant role in confined electromagnetic waves such as focused beams, guided waves, and evanescent waves. In the optical near-field, these transverse spins are generated owing to the spatial variation of the kinetic momentum of confined electromagnetic waves, where the spin and orbital angular momenta are strongly coupled, leading to many interesting topological spin structures and properties. Several reviews on optical transverse spins have been published in recent years in which their concepts and the various configurations producing them were introduced systematically. Here, we introduce in this review the underlying physics and dynamics of transverse spin and the resultant topological structures and properties such as the photonic skyrmions and merons. We term this sub-area 'spin photonics', its scope being to cover the design and research of spin structures in strongly confined electromagnetic fields with unique properties and applications. The concepts and framework reviewed have importance in optics, topological photonics, metrology, and quantum technologies and may be used to extend spin-dynamics concepts to fluidic, acoustic, and gravitational waves.

ABSTRACT: Originally discovered in condensed matter systems, topological insulators (TIs) have been ubiquitously extended to various fields of classical wave physics including photonics, phononics, acoustics, mechanics, and microwaves. In the bulk, like any other insulator, electronic TIs exhibit an excessively high resistance to the flow of mobile charges, prohibiting metallic conduction. On their surface, however, they support one-way conductive states with inherent protection against certain types of disorder and defects, defying the common physical wisdom of electronic transport in presence of impurities. When transposed to classical waves, TIs open a wealth of exciting engineering-oriented applications, such as robust routing, lasing, signal processing, switching, etc., with unprecedented robustness against various classes of defects. In this article, we first review the basic concept of topological order applied to classical waves, starting from the simple one-imensional example of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. We then move on to two-dimensional wave TIs, discussing classical wave analogues of Chern, quantum Hall, spin-Hall, Valley-Hall, and Floquet TIs. Finally, we review the most recent developments in the field, including Weyl and nodal semimetals, higherorder topological insulators, and self-induced non-linear topological states.

ABSTRACT: Two-dimensional topological photonic crystals have rapidly emerged as a recent and fascinating branch of photonic research. However, most of them were limited to a specific type of polarization, TE or TM polarization. Here, we explored the dual-polarization topological phases in two-dimensional magnetic photonic crystal (PC) which are composed of ferrite rod clusters in the plasma background. Under the perturbations of the bias magnetic field and/or the cluster distortion in the unit cell, the PC exhibited dual-polarization topological phases, including the quantum Hall (QH) phase, the higher-order quantum spin Hall (HO-QSH) phase and the conventional insulator (CI) phase. We studied the topological nature of these phases by the Wilson loop, Chern number, and unidirectional edge states. Intriguingly, we showed that the HO-QSH phases could present in PC of C (3v ) symmetry instead of being restricted to C (6v ) symmetry. The lower symmetry enlarges the gap in the edge states, which helps for the emergence of corner states. By continuously deforming the unit cell configuration, we demonstrated the phase transition in the system was dual-polarization. Our results extend the topological phases in the PCs and pave the way for the dual-polarization topological devices and their applications.

ABSTRACT: We present an all-dielectric photonic crystal structure that supports two-dimensionally confined helical topological edge states. The topological properties of the system are controlled by the crystal parameters. An interface between two regions of differing band topologies gives rise to topological edge states confined in a dielectric slab that propagate around sharp corners without backscattering. Three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain calculations show these edges to be confined in the out-of-plane direction by total internal reflection. Such nanoscale photonic crystal architectures could enable strong interactions between photonic edge states and quantum emitters.

ABSTRACT: Exceptional points (EPs) as branch singularities describe peculiar degeneracies of non-Hermitian systems, widely studied in topological and non-topological optical architectures with introducing gain or loss technically. This work focuses on the EPs in a topological waveguide (TW)-cavity coupled structure, where there is no need to introduce practical gain or loss. The topological cavity contains two degenerate counter-propagation topological whispering gallery modes, whose coupling with the TW leads to the effective gain and loss, responsible for the EP. Such a photonic architecture is designed practically by crystal-symmetry-protected topological photonic insulators based on air rods in conventional dielectric materials. The relevant EP reveals the breaking of the parity-time symmetry, reflected by the change of the transmission-dip number in the optical transmission spectra of the system. Achieving EPs in topological photonic systems possibly opens a new avenue toward robust optical devices with exceptional-point-based unique properties and functionalities.

ABSTRACT: Recent studies have shown that higher-order topologies in photonic systems lead to a robust enhancement of light-matter interactions. Moreover, higher-order topological phases have been extended to systems even without a band gap, as in Dirac semimetals. In this work, we propose a procedure to simultaneously generate two distinctive higher-order topological phases with corner states that allow a double resonant effect. This double resonance effect between the higher-order topological phases, was obtained from the design of a photonic structure with the ability to generate a higher-order topological (HOTI) insulator phase in the first bands and a higher-order Dirac half-metal phase (HODSM). Subsequently, using the corner states in both topological phases, we tuned the frequencies of both corner states such that they were separated in frequency by a second harmonic. This idea allowed us to obtain a double resonance effect with ultra-high overlap factors, and a considerable improvement in the nonlinear conversion efficiency. These results show the possibility of producing a second-harmonic generation with unprecedented conversion efficiencies in topological systems with simultaneous HOTI and HODSM phases. Furthermore, since the corner state in the HODSM phase presents an algebraic 1/r decay, our topological system can be helpful in experiments about the generation of nonlinear Dirac-ligh-matter interactions.

ABSTRACT: After the discovery of Dirac electrons in condensed matter physics, more specifically in graphene and its derivatives, their potentialities in the fields of plasmonics and photonics have been readily recognized, leading to a plethora of applications in active and tunable optical devices. Massless Dirac carriers have been further found in three-dimensional topological insulators. These exotic quantum systems have an insulating gap in the bulk and intrinsic Dirac metallic states at any surface, sustaining not only single-particle excitations but also plasmonic collective modes. In this paper we will review the plasmon excitations in different microstructures patterned on Bi2Se3 topological insulator thin films as measured by terahertz spectroscopy. We discuss the dependence of the plasmon absorption versus the microstructure shape, wavevector, and magnetic field. Finally we will discuss the topological protection of both the Dirac single-particle and plasmon excitations.

ABSTRACT: Topological insulators are materials that conduct on the surface and insulate in their interior due to non-trivial topology of the band structure. The edge states on the interface between topological (non-trivial) and conventional (trivial) insulators are topologically protected from scattering due to structural defects and disorders. Recently, it was shown that photonic crystals (PCs) can serve as a platform for realizing a scatter-free propagation of light waves. In conventional PCs, imperfections, structural disorders, and surface roughness lead to significant losses. The breakthrough in overcoming these problems is likely to come from the synergy of the topological PCs and silicon-based photonics technology that enables high integration density, lossless propagation, and immunity to fabrication imperfections. For many applications, reconfigurability and capability to control the propagation of these non-trivial photonic edge states is essential. One way to facilitate such dynamic control is to use liquid crystals (LCs), which allow to modify the refractive index with external electric field. Here, we demonstrate dynamic control of topological edge states by modifying the refractive index of a LC background medium. Background index is changed depending on the orientation of a LC, while preserving the topology of the system. This results in a change of the spectral position of the photonic bandgap and the topological edge states. The proposed concept might be implemented using conventional semiconductor technology, and can be used for robust energy transport in integrated photonic devices, all-optical circuity, and optical communication systems.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonic interfaces support topologically nontrivial optical modes with helical character. When combined with an embedded quantum emitter that has a circularly polarized transition dipole moment, a chiral quantum optical interface is formed due to spin-momentum locking. Here, we experimentally realize such an interface by integrating semiconductor quantum dots into a valley-Hall topological photonic crystal waveguide. We harness the robust waveguide transport to create a ring resonator that supports helical modes. Chiral coupling of quantum dot transitions, with directional contrast as high as 75%, is demonstrated. The interface also supports a topologically trivial mode, comparison with which allows us to clearly demonstrate the protection afforded by topology to the nontrivial mode.

ABSTRACT: We theoretically investigate the in-plane and transverse photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE) in a magnetic topological ultra-thin film (MTF) in the terahertz regime in the presence of an external magnetic field. We take into account the hybridization between the top and bottom surface states (SSs) and demonstrate that both the in-plane and transverse PSHE are quantized due to the Landau levels (LLs) quantization of the magneto-optical (MO) conductivities. The interplay between the effective energy induced by the hybridization interaction and the Zeeman energy plays an important role as it results in topological and normal insulating phases. By manipulating the interplay between these two interaction energies we drive the system through several topological quantum phase transitions (TQPTs). We show that the PSHE can be greatly enhanced and the magnitude of the giant PSHE in MTF is several hundreds times of the incident gaussian beam wavelength. Furthermore, we show that the PSHE is sensitive to the SSs of the Dirac fermions which is due to its topological character. This work sheds important light both on the PSHE and on the MO transport properties in MTFs in the presence of an external magnetic field which harbor great potentials in the development of new-generation photonics spin-Hall and optoelectronic devices.

ABSTRACT: Nonreciprocal interlayer coupling is difficult to practically implement in bilayer non-Hermitian topological photonic systems. In this work, we identify a similarity transformation between the Hamiltonians of systems with nonreciprocal interlayer coupling and on-site gain/loss. The similarity transformation is widely applicable, and we show its application in one- and two-dimensional bilayer topological systems as examples. The bilayer non-Hermitian system with nonreciprocal interlayer coupling, whose topological number can be defined using the gauge-smoothed Wilson loop, is topologically equivalent to the bilayer system with on-site gain/loss. We also show that the topological number of bilayer non-Hermitian C6v-typed domain-induced topological interface states can be defined in the same way as in the case of the bilayer non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. Our results show the relations between two microscopic provenances of the non-Hermiticity and provide a universal and convenient scheme for constructing and studying nonreciprocal interlayer coupling in bilayer non-Hermitian topological systems. This scheme is useful for observation of non-Hermitian skin effect in three-dimensional systems.

ABSTRACT: The existence of topologically protected edge modes is often cited as a highly desirable trait of topological insulators. However, these edge states are not always present. A realistic physical treatment of long-range hopping in a one-dimensional dipolar system can break the symmetry that protects the edge modes without affecting the bulk topological number, leading to a breakdown in bulk-edge correspondence (BEC). Hence, it is important to gain a better understanding of where and how this occurs, as well as how to measure it. Here we examine the behaviour of the bulk and edge modes in a dimerised chain of metallic nanoparticles and in a simpler non-Hermitian next-nearest-neighbour model to provide some insights into the phenomena of bulk-edge breakdown. We construct BEC phase diagrams for the simpler case and use these ideas to devise a measure of symmetry-breaking for the plasmonic system based on its bulk properties. This provides a parameter regime in which BEC is preserved in the topological plasmonic chain, as well as a framework for assessing this phenomenon in other systems.

ABSTRACT: In the last five years, the combination of advances in nanofabrication and a series of ingenious design ideas has enabled the implementation of topological concepts into nanophotonic platforms. In parallel, an unprecedented amount of research effort is being devoted to quantum technologies, with quantum information processing promising exponentially better performance than its classic counterpart for certain tasks. Nanophotonics is bound to play a key role in quantum information technologies given its compactness, low-power requirements, room-temperature operation, and the inherent high speed and low noise of photons. However, the scalability of quantum information systems in integrated photonic platforms is limited by scattering loss and other errors from random fabrication imperfections. The remarkable robustness to disorder and imperfections manifested by photonic states in topological systems emerges as a fascinating research avenue to tackle this issue. Furthermore, the ease of engineering and fabricating nanophotonic platforms with distinctive geometries and symmetries that can effectively generate and transport complex quantum states makes nanophotonics an ideal platform in which to realize topological protection of quantum photonic states. This article highlights the pioneering experimental efforts to understand the potential of topological protection on quantum photonic states and to outline a path toward robust quantum circuits.

ABSTRACT: Exploiting topological ideas has been a major theme in modern photonics, which provides unprecedented opportunities to design photonic devices with robustness against defects. While most previous works in topological photonics have focused on band theory, recent theories extend the topological concepts to the analysis of scattering matrices and suggest a topological route to complete polarization conversion (CPC). Here, the experimental observation of the topological CPC is reported. Using angle-resolved reflection measurements, it is unveiled experimentally that the CPC between arbitrary two polarizations occurs at vortex singularities of reflection coefficients in momentum space, reflecting its topological nature. Besides, it is visualized directly that for a given input polarization, the output one can cover the entire Poincare sphere over a wide frequency range by varying the incident angle, guaranteed by the topological nature of CPC, which is in sharp contrast to the conventional polarization-conversion approaches that usually suffer from the bulky volume, limited choice of eigen-polarization states, or narrow operation bandwidths. Remarkably, that BICs lie on the critical coupling curves that define the condition for CPC is experimentally demonstrated. This work paves the way to exploring the topological properties in scattering matrices for controlling light polarization and creating robust photonics devices.

ABSTRACT: Photonic topological systems are enticing alternatives to realize multifunctional optical circuits with minimum distortions due to their unique insulating features. Among them, expanded honeycomb structures give rise to topological phases without involving any external field or gyromagnetic materials. Unlike atoms in crystals, the morphology of the repeating element in photonic systems can be tailored, allowing to tune the different interelement couplings. In this regard, traditional circular rods are replaced in honeycomb lattices with teardrop-shaped pillars to push the center of mass outward, thus heightening the intercell interaction. This teardrop honeycomb lattice can provide a broader nontrivial bandgap and better edge-state confinement compared with a circular rod lattice with the same material-to-void filling factor. The approach proposes a novel method to tailor the performance of topological systems by engineering the individual pillars and results in better-confining waveguides that can be building blocks for designing more compact optical circuits under the same platform.

ABSTRACT: Topological phases of matter, originally derived from condensed matter physics, have been extensively exploited in photonics and phononics, and recently in mechanical metamaterial systems. Topological mechanics mainly aims at the anomalous edge channels of wave propaga-tion in mechanical metamaterials that has potential applications like a one-way robust wave -guide. However, most studies on topological mechanics focus on wave-based dynamics. Here, a novel class of static topology in one and two dimensions beyond wave dynamics is presented, via the static Rayleigh deformation mode in delicately designed two-and three-dimensional me-chanical metamaterials. It is shown that the topological properties that are usually presented in dynamic systems, such as the topological invariants and bulk-edge correspondence, are also available in the static systems. It is demonstrated analytically and experimentally that for topo-logically protected zero modes, externally applied boundary loads can be fully blocked from penetrating the bulk, showing the effect of deformation shielding. Moreover, high-order topo-logical corner states and valley Hall effects are also explored with the proposed prototypical mechanical metamaterials. This study generalizes the concepts of topological mechanics beyond frequency-based wave dynamics.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics is an emerging field that attracts enormous interest for its novel ways to engineer the flow of light. With the help of topological protection, the surface modes of topological photonic systems have intriguing properties, such as the unidirectional propagation, robust transmission against defects and disorders, which meet the rapidly growing demands for information processing. Valley photonic crystals, as one kind of topological photonic systems, not only support protected surface modes, but also are friendly to micro-nano fabrication. These advantages show that it has broad prospects in constructing high-performance photonic devices or even photonic integrated circuits. Here, we review the properties and development of valley photonic crystals. Firstly, the theory and structure are briefly introduced and then the discussion of robust transmission will be followed. Furthermore, prototypes of on-chip devices based on valley photonic crystals are reviewed. As a perspective in photonics, valley photonic crystal is expected to become a good platform to study nanophotonics and realize advancing integrated photonics devices. [GRAPHICS] .

ABSTRACT: First- and second-order topological phases, capable of inherent protection against disorder of materials, have been recently experimentally demonstrated in various artificial materials through observing the topologically protected edge states. Topological phase transition represents a new class of quantum critical phenomena, which is accompanied by the changes related to the bulk topology of energy band structures instead of symmetry. However, it is still a challenge to directly observe the topological phase transitions defined in terms of bulk states. Here, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate the direct observation of multifarious topological phase transitions with real-space indicator in a single photonic chip, which is formed by integration of 324 x 33 waveguides supporting both first- and second-order topological phases. The trivial-to-first-order, trivial-to-second-order and first-to-second-order topological phase transitions signified by the band gap closure can all be directly detected via photon evolution in the bulk. We further observe the creation and destruction of gapped topological edge states associated with these topological phase transitions. The bulk-state-based route to investigate the high-dimensional and high-order topological features, together with the platform of freely engineering topological materials by three-dimensional laser direct writing in a single photonic chip, opens up a new avenue to explore the mechanisms and applications of artificial devices.

ABSTRACT: In this article, we propose on-chip terahertz (THz) domino waveguide array structures that can enable the topological effect and enhance the robustness of THz transmission. THz topological effect (include topologically protected edge states and binding states) is excited by constructing kink and antikink structures in designed domino waveguide arrays. Furthermore, the robustness of topological waveguide arrays is successfully demonstrated. The topological transmission effects have been experimentally demonstrated using scanning near-field THz microscopy. Our study provides a new approach to study the topological photonic transport of waveguide arrays in the THz regime and has potential application in THz-integrated circuit.

ABSTRACT: Light and sound are the most ubiquitous forms of waves, associated with a variety of phenomena and physical effects such as rainbows and echoes. Light and sound, both categorized as classical waves, have lately been brought into unexpected connections with exotic topological phases of matter. We are currently witnessing the onset of a second wave of active research into this topic. The past decade has been marked by fundamental advances comprising two-dimensional quantum Hall insulators and quantum spin and valley Hall insulators, whose topological properties are characterized using linear band topology. Here, going beyond these conventional topological systems, we focus on the latest frontiers, including non-Hermitian, nonlinear and non-Abelian topology as well as topological defects, for which the characterization of the topological features goes beyond the standard band-topology language. In addition to an overview of the current state of the art, we also survey future research directions for valuable applications.

ABSTRACT: The topological nanophotonic wavelength router, which can steer light with different wavelength signals into different topological channels, plays a key role in optical information processing. However, no effective method has been found to realize such a topological nanophotonic device. Here, an on-chip topological nanophotonic wavelength router working in an optical telecom band is designed based on a topology optimization algorithm and experimentally demonstrated. Valley photonic crystal is used to provide a topological state in the optical telecom band. The measured topological wavelength router has narrow signal peaks and is easy for integration. This work offers an efficient scheme for the realization of topological devices and lays a foundation for the future application of topological photonics.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics has attracted much attention in the community of photonics due to the fundamental and practical significances. Recently, topological photonic crystal fibers (PCFs) have been proposed as a new category of photonic topological systems, while the investigations in this direction are still at an early stage, only dealing with linear effects. This work theoretically demonstrates supercontinuum (SC) generation with waveguiding corner modes in topological fibers composed of hexagonal holey photonic crystals of chalcogenide material. The proposed topological PCF has high nonlinearity due to the small mode area and high material nonlinearity, enabling octave-spanning SC generation with low pump energy at the central wavelength of 1550 nm. The topological PCFs exhibit the dispersion characteristics and SC spectra which are immune to the structural defects, contrary to the non-topological ones. The results presented in this work pave the way towards nonlinear fiber optics with structural defects-immune performances.

ABSTRACT: We study transport of time-bin entangled photon pairs in a 2D topological photonic system of coupled ring resonators. We show that the transport through edge bands preserves temporal correlations of input photons. Furthermore, edge transport is robust against system disorder and only marginally affects the temporal correlations of photons. In contrast, transport through bulk band leads to unwanted bunching/anti-bunching of photons and the probability of bunching/anti-bunching increases with increasing disorder. Finally, we discuss our experimentally efforts to demonstrate the robustness of edge states for quantum transport.

ABSTRACT: The possibility of obtaining edge states of light that are robust against disorder by mimicking the topological properties of a solid-state system has brought a profound impact on optical sciences. In the short-wavelength region, X-ray science and technology is undergoing tremendous development. It requires high-precision optics with exquisite control of light properties and robustness against structural perturbations. Therefore, it is very attractive to extend the concept of optical topological manipulation to the X-ray regime. Herein, the topological edge state is theoretically proposed and experimentally demonstrated at the interface of two kinds of photonic crystals having different bandgap topological characteristics in the X-ray regime. Remarkably, this topologically protected edge state is immune to the thickness disorder as long as the zero-average-effective-mass condition is satisfied. This work extends the topological photonics to the X-ray regime and paves the way for the development of novel X-ray optics such as high-resolution X-ray filters/monochromators, or X-ray quantum optics, to realize the phenomena such as Rabi splitting that are robust against disorders.

ABSTRACT: The unidirectional propagation of the pseudospin-locked optical waves can be achieved by using the helical edge states in two-dimensional topological spin photonic crystals. Although there have been lots of researches on topological spin photonic crystal, the unidirectional propagation regulation of helical edge states has been rarely studied up to now. Herein, by tuning the diameter D of the dielectric rod and the distance R between the center of the unit cell and the center of the rod in two-dimensional topological spin photonic crystal with C-6v symmetry, the effects of geometric parameters on the bandgap structure, topological properties and unidirectional propagation of helical edge states in topological spin photonics crystals are studied in detail. The results show that the parameter R has significant effects on the bandgap structure and topological properties of topological spin photonic crystal, and the diameter D of rod only affects the bandgap positions. The structures of helical edge states and their unidirectional propagations are closely related to the topological properties of the bandgaps and the frequency structures of photonic crystals on both sides of boundary. Without changing the topological properties of bandgaps, only changing the structures of the photonics crystals on either side of the boundary can also regulate the structures of the helical edge states and their unidirectional propagation. Thus, by adjusting the geometric parameters R and D of the topological spin photonic crystals, the helical edge states and their unidirectional propagations can be controlled. This study provides useful references for the selection and application of helical edge states in topological spin photonic crytals.

ABSTRACT: In most cases, higher-order topological insulating phases are observed in crystalline materials and photonic/phononic crystals with high crystalline symmetries. Few exceptions include amorphous and quasi-crystalline matters, which have recently been demonstrated to exhibit such topological phases as well. This report reveals analytically and numerically that the photonic crystals with asymmetric sublattices can also exhibit second-order topological insulating phases. The appearance of band inversion for the change of unit cell parameters, the quantized 2D polarizations and topological corner charges, and the generation of corner states explicitly reveal the existence of such second-order photonic topological insulating phases. Quite interestingly, for arbitrarily shaped asymmetric unit cells, second-order topological corner states are also observed, provided that the intercell coupling dominates over the intracell one.

ABSTRACT: A miniature on-chip laser is an essential component of photonic integrated circuits for a plethora of applications, including optical communication and quantum information processing. However, the contradicting requirements of small footprint, robustness, single-mode operation, and high output power have led to a multi-decade search for the optimal on-chip laser design. During this search, topological phases of matter-conceived initially in electronic materials in condensed matter physics-were successfully extended to photonics and applied to miniature laser designs. Benefiting from the topological protection, a topological edge mode laser can emit more efficiently and more robustly than one emitting from a trivial bulk mode. In addition, single-mode operation over a large range of excitation energies can be achieved by strategically manipulating topological modes in a laser cavity. In this Perspective, we discuss the recent progress of topological on-chip lasers and an outlook on future research directions. (c) 2023 Author(s).

ABSTRACT: In this paper, optically controllable and topologically protected plasmon transport is implemented via a topological nanohole plasmonic waveguide coupled to a standard edge mode of a graphene metasurface. By introducing nanoholes with different sizes in the unit cell, one breaks the spatial-inversion symmetry of a graphene metasurface in which the topological waveguide is constructed, leading to the emergence of topologically protected modes located in a nontrivial band-gap. Based on the strong Kerr effect and tunable optical properties of graphene, the coupling between the edge and topological interface modes can be efficiently controlled by optical means provided by an optical pump beam injected in a bulk mode. In particular, by tuning the power inserted in the bulk mode, one can control the difference between the wave-vectors of the topological and edge modes and consequently the optical power coupled in the topological mode. Our results show that when the pump power approaches a specific value, the edge and topological modes become phase-matched and the topological waveguide mode can be efficiently excited. Finally, we demonstrated that the optical coupling is strongly dependent on the group-velocity of the pump mode, a device feature that can be important in practical applications.

ABSTRACT: An intelligent approach for inversely designing topological photonic crystals (PCs) with time-reversal symmetry (TRS) at any desired frequency is presented. By accurately controlling the frequencies of dipolar and quadrupolar modes, PCs with double Dirac cones and their band inversion are successfully realized through topology optimization. Novel patterns for topological trivial and nontrivial PCs with extra-wide bandgaps are created for the realization of spin-locked unidirectional propagation and robust transport of topological edge states. The systematic design reveals the evolution of the geometry of dielectric materials within unit cells of topological trivial and nontrivial PCs from low to high frequencies. Finally, the geometric rules of topological trivial and nontrivial PCs are extracted and analyzed for the ease of design and fabrication.

ABSTRACT: A photonics-based broadband radar with remoting antennas is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. A linearly-frequency-modulated (LFM) signal is generated by microwave photonic frequency quadrupling in central office and transmitted to a remote antenna unit by employing the radio-over-fiber (ROF) technology. In antenna unit, the photonic LFM signal is split into two branches. Light signal in one branch is converted to RF and emitted out. Light signal in the other branch is fed into a dual polarization parallel topological photonic mixer to perform the operation of de-chirp on receive. A Ku-band photonics-based radar with a bandwidth of 2 GHz is demonstrated. An inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging experiment is carried out to verify the performance of the system.

ABSTRACT: Terahertz (THz) technology has seen significant advancements in the past decades, encompassing both fundamental scientific research, such as THz quantum optics, and highly applied areas like sixth-generation communications, medical imaging, and biosensing. However, the progress of on-chip THz integrated waveguides still lags behind that of THz sources and detectors. This is attributed to issues such as ohmic losses in microstrip lines, coplanar and hollow waveguides, bulky footprints, and reflection and scattering losses occurring at sharp bends or defects in conventional dielectric waveguides. Inspired by the quantum Hall effects and topological insulators in condensed matter systems, recent discoveries of topological phases of light have led to the development of topological waveguides. These waveguides exhibit remarkable phenomena, such as robust unidirectional propagation and reflectionless behavior against impurities or defects. As a result, they hold tremendous promise for THz on-chip applications. While THz photonic topological insulators (PTIs), including wave division, multiport couplers, and resonant cavities, have been demonstrated to cover a wavelength range of 800-2500 nm, research on tunable THz PTIs remains limited. In this perspective, we briefly reviewed a few examples of tunable PTIs, primarily concentrated in the infrared range. Furthermore, we proposed how these designs could benefit the development of THz on-chip PTIs. We explore the potential methods for achieving tunable THz PTIs through optical, electrical, and thermal means. Additionally, we present a design of THz PTIs for potential on-chip sensing applications. To support our speculation, several simulations were performed, providing valuable insights for future THz on-chip PTI designs.(c) 2023 Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Full wavefront control by photonic components requires that the spatial phase modulation on an incoming optical beam ranges from 0 to 2 pi. Because of their radiative coupling to the environment, all optical components are intrinsically non-Hermitian systems, often described by reflection and transmission matrices with complex eigenfrequencies. Here, it is shown that parity or time symmetry breaking-either explicit or spontaneous-moves the position of zero singularities of the reflection or transmission matrices from the real axis to the upper part of the complex frequency plane. A universal 0 to 2 pi-phase gradient of an output channel as a function of the real frequency excitation is thus realized whenever the discontinuity branch bridging a zero and a pole, that is, a pair of singularities, is crossing the real axis. This basic understanding is applied to engineer electromagnetic fields at interfaces, including, but not limited to, metasurfaces. Non-Hermitian topological features associated with exceptional degeneracies or branch cut crossing are shown to play a surprisingly pivotal role in the design of resonant photonic systems.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics provides exciting and emerg-ing opportunities for the manipulation of light. As the photonicanalogue of quantum Hall edge states, chiral edge modes, arising atthe interface between two photonic topological structures withdifferent Chern numbers, hold great promise for robust transportof light against disorders and defects. However, for magneto-opticalmaterial-based topological photonic crystals, the transport perform-ance of chiral edge modes is strongly dependent on the topologicalgap sizes, which are usually very narrow at optical frequencies dueto the lack of magneto-optical materials with strong nonreciprocalresponses. Here, we numerically demonstrated that the introduc-tion of an epsilon-near-zero effect to magneto-optical photoniccrystals could remarkably enlarge topological gap sizes due to the boosted magneto-optical response. Eigenmode calculation resultsshow that the boosted magneto-optical response correlates to the enhanced nonreciprocal powerflows in magnetized photoniccrystals with an epsilon-near-zero diagonal permittivity. The enlarged topological band gap leads to the broadband and well-confinedchiral edge modes propagating along the magnetized boundary between two oppositely magnetized photonic crystals. Moreimportantly, such mode propagation shows strong robustness against sharp bends and large defects. In principle, our proposal for theenlargement of topological photonic band gaps could also be valid in photonic crystal slabs or even three-dimensional photoniccrystals. Our results not only suggest the possibility to improve the transport performance of one-way modes in magneto-opticalphotonic crystals but also enrich the physical understanding of the epsilon-near-zero effect-based topological photonics

ABSTRACT: Topological photonic devices with dynamically tunable functions are highly on demand in practice, but the majority of previously proposed photonic systems have been limited to fixed performances, once fabricated. Although several approaches have been proposed for obtaining the tunability in topological photonic systems, they are limited to first-order topological states and require rather complicated structures. Herein, second-order topological properties of rhombic photonic crystals (PCs) are revealed, for the first time, enabling to realize tunable photonic devices. For this purpose, the conventional square lattice PCs composed of four rigid dielectric rods are reshaped to rhomboid ones with preserved inversion symmetry, which exhibit well-quantized bulk polarizations. Since the eigenfrequencies of topological edge and corner states depend on the angle between the neighboring sides of unit cells, the second-order topological systems exhibit dynamic tunability, being useful for diverse applications such as optical switching and flexible beam control. Unlike the previous results for reconfigurable routing limited to special angles, this lattice-reshaping mechanism has the ability to realize dynamically tunable routing, extending the realm of applications of topological photonics. For its simplicity and feasibility, this mechanical lattice-reshaping approach paves the way toward higher-order topological photonic devices with dynamically controlled functions.

ABSTRACT: Light-matter interactions in a chiral structure can induce strong polarization selectivity. Specifically, an optical activity in a form of polarization rotation and a circular dichroism may be controlled by the mirror symmetry breaking of the unit-cell geometry. We design and experimentally investigate plasmonic metasurfaces with a spatially varying chiral geometry and demonstrate how this architecture may lead to a geometric Berry phase. Our designed structure produces a polarizationdependent diffraction of nearly linear states. We experimentally examine the diffraction orders and show that they are topological in nature. Moreover, the influence of various geometrical factors is also investigated.

ABSTRACT: Topological material has been widely studied in recent years because of excellent physical properties. In this paper, a Weyl topological material composed of the double left-handed helixes is presented. It is demonstrated that the proposed structure possesses a two-dimensional complete topological nontrivial bandgap for a fixed k(z) in the microwave frequency, and the robust surface states are observed. This unique function provides a promising platform for the development of photonics and electromagnetics.

ABSTRACT: We numerically demonstrate robust terahertz (THz) transmissions in a topological photonic crystal comprised of dielectric rod structures. Topological edge states (i.e., the vortex states) in the structure are excited via a zig-zag domain boundary at the interface of two nontrivial valley photonic crystals (VPCs). A comprehensive study of the effect of asymmetry (defined as delta d = d(1) - d(2)) on transmission loss and bandwidth is performed for three different kinds of domain boundaries: straight, Z-shape, and Omega-shape. An increase in the bandwidth of the topological THz transmission is achieved with the increasing asymmetry. The study further demonstrates blue shifting of the topological transmission bandwidth with the increase in asymmetry. An optimized value of the asymmetry parameter is obtained based on the bandwidth as well as the transmission loss. The most robust propagation in terms of the widest bandwidth and low loss transmission is achieved with asymmetry >= 0.25a. The robust THz transmission is attributed to the strong edge modes confinement at the domain boundary of the VPC due to intervalley scattering suppression at this optimal value. Our observations open the path for a strong electromagnetic wave flow in the THz regime with a high transmission, which could be useful in photonic broadband communication and other on-chip applications at THz frequencies, particularly for 6G communications.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonic systems have recently become an important platform for manipulating the flow of electromagnetic (EM) waves owing to unique features like backscattering-immune unidirectional propagation of light which could be harnessed for various robust-device applications. In this context, recent advances in 3D printing have further facilitated the practical implementation of a variety of topological systems offering enormous flexibility in designing the devices. With this pretext, we experimentally demonstrate a 3D-printed topological photonic crystal (TPC) constituted by cylindrical metal rods, wherein topological propagation is enabled through a zigzag-type domain boundary (DB) formed by merging two valley photonic crystals. The valley edge mode generation as well as the robust propagation of EM waves in the TPC sample are probed in the presence of different physical obstacles in the form of dielectric and metallic blocks. Very high transmission with an approximate minimal loss of similar to-1.3 dB to -3.8 dB is observed even in the presence of obstacles in the DB. The strong EM field confinement across the DB is further validated through experimentally capturing the electric field distributions in the xy-plane of the studied TPC. The demonstrated TPC scheme can open new routes towards the development of cost-effective devices requiring robust EM transmission even in the presence of foreign obstacles/defects.

ABSTRACT: In recent years, a variety of 2-dimensional (2D) materials including graphene, topological insulators, transition metal dichalcogenides, and black phosphorus have been utilized in photonics and optoelectronics applications. Since the mid-infrared (MIR) region has a significant role in various fields, rapid progress has been made on photonics and optoelectronics applications using 2D materials. Herein, the progress in the photonics devices that exploit the unique properties of 2D materials for a range of MIR applications is summarized, focusing on ultrafast light generation, MIR light modulation, and photodetection. By taking advantage of ultrafast light response, broadband absorption, and high carrier mobility of 2D materials, femtosecond lasers, broadband optical modulators, and high-responsivity photodetectors are achieved. Some perspectives on 2D material-based MIR photonics are highlighted. Due to their MIR bandgaps, small size, high carrier mobility, and easy integration, 2D materials are appealing for MIR photonics applications. Moreover, the availability of an increasingly broad library of 2D materials with variable electronic and optical properties, and the ability to be thinned and restacked into functional and complex assembled structures, enable the development of a highly integrated MIR photonic chip, which will make information technology greener, faster, and lower in energy consumption.

ABSTRACT: Engineering local angular momentum of structured light fields in real space enables applications in many fields, in particular, the realization of unidirectional robust transport in topological photonic crystals with a non-trivial Berry vortex in momentum space. Here, we show transverse angular momentum modes in silicon topological photonic crystals when considering transverse electric polarization. Excited by a chiral external source with either transverse spin angular momentum or transverse phase vortex, robust light flow propagating along opposite directions is observed in several kinds of sharp-turn interfaces between two topologically-distinct silicon photonic crystals. A transverse orbital angular momentum mode with alternating phase vortex exists at the boundary of two such photonic crystals. In addition, unidirectional transport is robust to the working frequency even when the ring size or location of the pseudo-spin source varies in a certain range, leading to the superiority of the broadband photonic device. These findings enable one to make use of transverse angular momentum, a kind of degree of freedom, to achieve unidirectional robust transport in the telecom region and other potential applications in integrated photonic circuits, such as on-chip robust delay lines.

ABSTRACT: Liquid crystals (LCs) form an extremely rich range of self-assembled topological structures with artificially or naturally created topological defects. Some of the main applications of LCs are various optical and photonic devices, where compared to their solid-state counterparts, soft photonic systems are fundamentally different in terms of unique properties such as self-assembly, self-healing, large tunability, sensitivity to external stimuli, and biocompatibility. Here we show that complex tunable microlasers emitting structured light can be generated from self-assembled topological LC superstructures containing topological defects inserted into a thin Fabry-Perot microcavity. The topology and geometry of the LC superstructure determine the structuring of the emitted light by providing complex three-dimensionally varying optical axis and order parameter singularities, also affecting the topology of the light polarization. The microlaser can be switched between modes by an electric field, and its wavelength can be tuned with temperature. The proposed soft matter microlaser approach opens directions in soft matter photonics research, where structured light with specifically tailored intensity and polarization fields could be designed and implemented.

ABSTRACT: Using numerical simulations and the results of our experiments we discuss the behaviour of a defect-free cholesteric liquid crystal in rather a strong electric field. The smooth helix unwinding predicted by de Gennes (Solid State Commun. 1968, 6, 163,) occurs under the thermodynamic equilibrium conditions and can easily proceed with the assistance of multiple defects. The defect-free helix in the field strictly perpendicular to the helical axis cannot be unwound for topological reasons. The field deforms the helix without a change of its period and induces higher harmonics of the helical structure. Due to the latter, the shape of the Bragg photonic stop-band changes and a second-order photonic band is observed in the optical transmission. Moreover, novel laser effects are predicted by modelling for the dye-doped, distorted cholesteric structure. The same field-induced anharmonicity results in a strong change of the polarisation state of the beam passing the helical structure along its axis. Due to fast relaxation of the higher harmonics, the switching time of the devices using the corresponding electro-optical effect (called in-plane switching) can be improved significantly. This is shown both experimentally and by numerical calculations.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics is an emerging research area that focuses on the topological states of classical light. Here we reveal the topological phases that are intrinsic to the quantum nature of light, i.e. solely related to the quantized Fock states and the inhomogeneous coupling strengths between them. The Hamiltonian of two cavities coupled with a two-level atom is an intrinsic one-dimensional Su-Schriefer-Heeger model of Fock states. By adding another cavity, the Fock-state lattice is extended to two dimensions with a honeycomb structure, where the strain due to the inhomogeneous coupling strengths of the annihilation operator induces a Lifshitz topological phase transition between a semimetal and three band insulators within the lattice. In the semimetallic phase, the strain is equivalent to a pseudomagnetic field, which results in the quantization of the Landau levels and the valley Hall effect. We further construct an inhomogeneous Fock-state Haldane model where the topological phases can be characterized by the topological markers. With d cavities being coupled to the atom, the lattice is extended to d - 1 dimensions without an upper limit. In this study we demonstrate a fundamental distinction between the topological phases in quantum and classical optics and provide a novel platform for studying topological physics in dimensions higher than three.

ABSTRACT: Photonic topological insulators have emerged as an exciting new platform for backscatter-free waveguiding even in the presence of defects, with applications in robust long-range energy and quantum information transfer, spectroscopy and sensing, chiral quantum optics, and optoelectronics. We report a design for planar photonic topological waveguides with low index contrast and produce the structure entirely from polymeric materials via three-dimensional printing. We combine rapid device fabrication with high-speed finite-difference time-domain simulation to quantify topological protection of transmission through omega shaped bent topological waveguides and find that one corner in the waveguide is 3-5 times more robust to lattice defects than the other. This dichotomy, a new empirical design rule for topological insulator devices, is shown to originate in the fundamental system symmetries and is illustrated via the distributions of Poynting vectors that describe energy flow through the waveguide. We shed new light on the nature of topological protection in these systems, observing that the robustness to defects at the two corners depends not only on the symmetry at the domain wall but also on that of the adjacent unit cells.

ABSTRACT: An important advantage of optical signal processing is the possibility of performing various operations in parallel. Among the techniques proposed for parallel optical signal processing, frequency division multiplexing (FDM) is a well-known approach, in which different operations are performed in multiple sub-channels associated with different frequency bands. Here, we demonstrate the possibility of performing parallel optical signal processing by frequency division multiplexing of the edge modes of a topological photonic structure. This leads to the realization of a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) topological optical signal processor that is capable of performing several analog functionalities simultaneously, enhancing the speed of computation significantly. Our theoretical and experimental findings open up the venue towards the realization of a new generation of multi-functional topological optical signal processing systems that are ultra-fast, consume little power, and enjoy strong protection against disorder.

ABSTRACT: Synthetic lattice systems are powerful platforms for studying the influence of intrinsic nonlinearities on topological phenomena. Here the authors elucidate the topological transport of solitons in terms of Wannier functions displacement and they introduce a nonlinearity-induced topological transport effect that could be observed in ultracold quantum mixtures. Exploring the interplay between topological band structures and tunable nonlinearities has become possible with the development of synthetic lattice systems. In this emerging field of nonlinear topological physics, an experiment revealed the quantized motion of solitons in Thouless pumps and suggested that this phenomenon was dictated by the Chern number of the band from which solitons emanate. Here, we elucidate the origin of this nonlinear topological effect, by showing that the motion of solitons is established by the quantized displacement of the underlying Wannier functions. Our general theoretical approach, which fully clarifies the central role of the Chern number in solitonic pumps, provides a framework for describing the topological transport of nonlinear excitations in a broad class of physical systems. Exploiting this interdisciplinarity, we introduce an interaction-induced topological pump for ultracold atomic mixtures, where solitons of impurity atoms experience a quantized drift resulting from genuine interaction processes with their environment.

ABSTRACT: We study theoretically the evolution of entangled non-Gaussian two-photon states in disordered topological lattices. Specifically, we consider spatially entangled two-photon states, modulated by Laguerre polynomials up to the 3rd order, which feature ring-shaped spatial and spectral correlation patterns. Such states are discrete analogs of photon-subtracted squeezed states, which are ubiquitous in optical quantum information processing or sensing applications. We find that, in general, a higher degree of entanglement coincides with a loss of topological protection against disorder, this is in line with previous results for Gaussian two-photon states. However, we identify a particular regime in the parameter space of the considered non-Gaussian states, where the situation is reversed and an increase of entanglement can be beneficial for the transport of two-photon quantum states through disordered regions.

ABSTRACT: A topological insulator is a material with an insulating interior but time-reversal symmetry-protected conducting edge states. Since its prediction and discovery almost a decade ago, such a symmetry-protected topological phase has been explored beyond electronic systems in the realm of photonics. Electrons are spin-1/2 particles, whereas photons are spin-1 particles. The distinct spin difference between these two kinds of particles means that their corresponding symmetry is fundamentally different. It is well understood that an electronic topological insulator is protected by the electron's spin-1/2 (fermionic) time-reversal symmetry T-f(2) = -1. However, the same protection does not exist under normal circumstances for a photonic topological insulator, due to photon's spin-1 (bosonic) time-reversal symmetry T-b(2) = 1. In this work, we report a design of photonic topological insulator using the Tellegen magnetoelectric coupling as the photonic pseudospin orbit interaction for left and right circularly polarized helical spin states. The Tellegen magnetoelectric coupling breaks bosonic time-reversal symmetry but instead gives rise to a conserved artificial fermionic-like-pseudo time-reversal symmetry, T-p (T-p(2) = -1), due to the electromagnetic duality. Surprisingly, we find that, in this system, the helical edge states are, in fact, protected by this fermionic-like pseudo time-reversal symmetry T-p rather than by the bosonic time-reversal symmetry T-b. This remarkable finding is expected to pave a new path to understanding the symmetry protection mechanism for topological phases of other fundamental particles and to searching for novel implementations for topological insulators.

ABSTRACT: The central idea of metamaterials and metaoptics is that, besides their base materials, the geometry of structures offers a broad extra dimension to explore for exotic functionalities. Here, we discover that the topology of structures fundamentally dictates the topological properties of optical fields and offers a new dimension to exploit for optical functionalities that are irrelevant to specific material constituents or structural geometries. We find that the nontrivial topology of metal structures ensures the birth of polarization singularities (PSs) in the near field with rich morphologies and intriguing spatial evolutions including merging, bifurcation, and topological transition. By mapping the PSs to non-Hermitian exceptional points and using homotopy theory, we extract the core invariant that governs the topological classification of the PSs and the conservation law that regulates their spatial evolutions. The results bridge singular optics, topological photonics, and non-Hermitian physics, with potential applications in chiral sensing, chiral quantum optics, and beyond photonics in other wave systems.

ABSTRACT: The magnetic nanomaterial Mn3Si2Te6 is a promising option for spin-dependent electronic and magneto-optoelectronic devices. However, its application in nonlinear optics remains fanciful. Here, we demonstrate a pulsed Er-doped fiber laser (EDFL) based on a novel quasi-2D Mn3Si2Te6 saturable absorber (SA) with low pump power at 1.5 mu m. The high-quality Mn3Si2Te6 crystals were synthesized by the self-flux method, and the ultrathin Mn3Si2Te6 nanoflakes were prepared by a simple mechanical exfoliation procedure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time laser pulses have been generated using quasi-2D Mn3Si2Te6. A stable pulsed laser at 1562 nm with a low threshold pump power of 60 mW was produced by integrating the Mn3Si2Te6 SA into an EDFL cavity. The maximum power of the output pulse is 783 mu W. The repetition rate can vary from 24.16 to 44.44 kHz, with corresponding pulse durations of 5.64 to 3.41 mu s. Our results indicate that the quasi-2D Mn3Si2Te6 is a promising material for application in ultrafast photonics.

ABSTRACT: Halide perovskite nano-and microlasers have become a very convenient tool for many applications from sensing to reconfigurable optical chips. Indeed, they exhibit outstanding emission robustness to crystalline defects due to so-called defect tolerance allowing for their simple chemical synthesis and further integration with various photonic designs. Here we demonstrate that such robust microlasers can be combined with another class of resilient photonic components, namely, with topological metasurfaces supporting topological guided boundary modes. We show that this approach allows to outcouple and deliver the generated coherent light over tens of microns despite the presence of defects of different nature in the structure: sharp corners in the waveguide, random location of the microlaser, and defects in the microlaser caused by mechanical pressure applied during its transfer to the metasurface. As a result, the developed platform provides a strategy to attain robust integrated lasing-waveguiding designs resilient to a broad range of structural imperfections, both for electrons in a laser and for pseudo-spin-polarized photons in a waveguide.

ABSTRACT: Topologically protected plasmonic states with wide topological band gaps provide unprecedented robustness against disorder-induced backscattering. In this study, we design a graphene bi-layer metasurface that possesses valley-Hall topological plasmonic modes in a nontrivial bandgap. In particular, the breaking of mirror symmetry of two graphene layers is achieved via a horizontal shift of the hole lattice of the top layer, which leads to topologically protected edge modes in the nontrivial bandgap. The corresponding band dispersion of the topological edge modes shows unidirectional propagation features. Moreover, we have designed a sensitive molecular sensor based on such graphene bi-layer metasurfaces, using the fact that the chemical potential of graphene varies upon adsorption of gas molecules. This effect leads to a marked variation of the transmission of the topological mode, and thus a sensing device with large sensitivity can be realized.

ABSTRACT: An on-chip integrated one-dimension topological insulator in the optical communication range is realized directly in an integrated photonic circuit. The system takes on a configuration of a 220 nm thick 1D photonic crystal heterostructure sandwiched between two gold films. A photonic topological edge state centered at 1550 nm is obtained for the chip-integrated one-dimension topological insulator made of a silicon/SiO2 photonic crystal heterostructure with a feature size of only 2.25 mu m integrated with a silicon waveguide. On/off switching of the photonic topological edge state was also achieved in a 1D topological insulator made of a VO2/SiO2 photonic crystal heterostructure based on a thermally induced insulator-to-metal transition of VO2. This system not only paves the way for practical applications of photonic topological insulators in integrated photonic devices and chips but also provides a platform for fundamental studies of topological photonics.

ABSTRACT: Terahertz photonic chips play an important role in next-generation information systems, such as high-speed inter/intrachip connections. Here we report a hybrid hollow-core terahertz topological planar waveguide where topological silicon pillars (assembled as expanded and compressed hexagonal clusters) are sandwiched between parallel gold plates. Assisted by numerical optimization of topological waveguide unit cells and supercells, we achieve a wide topological bandgap (relative bandwidth of 16.1%) in which two low-loss (below 0.1 dB/mm) topological pseudospin states exist and cover 81.8% of the bandgap. The dual unidirectional channel in a single waveguide path can be used for short-range (below 100 mm) 10-Gbps full-duplex on-chip transmissions under the forward error correction limit (bit error rate less than 10(-3)). Simulation results reveal that the communication performance of the proposed topological waveguide is largely group velocity dispersion dependent. This work may pave an avenue for high-speed integrated circuit design and applications in both electric and photonic fields.

ABSTRACT: Surface lattice modes, generated by the evanescent coupling between localized modes of optical resonators arranged in a two-dimensional (2D) array, generally exhibit remarkable optical response beyond the single photonic particle. Here, by employing the lattice mode concept, we demonstrate that lattice topological edge and corner modes can be achieved in properly designed photonic crystal (PhC) slabs. Such slabs consist of an array of finite-sized second-order topological insulators mimicking the 2D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. The proposed lattice edge and corner modes emerge within the topological band gap of the PhC slab, which dictates their topological nature. In particular, the band diagram of the lattice corner modes shows that they possess non-degenerate eigenfrequencies and dispersive bands. In addition, we show that the eigenfrequency of the lattice topological modes can be shifted by tuning the intercell and/or intracell optical coupling. Finally, by finely tuning the geometric parameters of the slab, we realize a lattice corner mode possessing flatband dispersion characteristics. Our study can find applications to topological lasing, nonlinearity enhancement, and slow-light effects in topological photonic systems.

ABSTRACT: Topological lasers have been intensively investigated as a strong candidate for robust single-mode lasers. A typical topological laser employs a single-mode topological edge state, which appears deterministically in a designed topological bandgap and exhibits robustness to disorder. These properties seem to be highly attractive in pursuit of high-power lasers capable of single mode operation. In this paper, we theoretically analyze a large-scale single-mode laser based on a topological edge state. We consider a sizable array laser consisting of a few hundreds of site resonators, which support a single topological edge mode broadly distributed among the resonators. We build a basic model describing the laser using the tight binding approximation and evaluate the stability of single mode lasing based on the threshold gain difference Delta alpha between the first-lasing edge mode and the second-lasing competing bulk mode. Our calculations demonstrate that stronger couplings between the cavities and lower losses are advantageous for achieving stable operation of the device. When assuming an average coupling of 100 cm(-1) between site resonators and other realistic parameters, the threshold gain difference Delta alpha can reach about 2 cm(-1), which would be sufficient for stable single mode lasing using a conventional semiconductor laser architecture. We also consider the effects of possible disorders and long-range interactions to assess the robustness of the laser under non-ideal situations. These results lay the groundwork for developing single-mode high-power topological lasers.

ABSTRACT: Topological lasers based on topologically protected edge states exhibit unique features and enhanced robustness of operation in comparison with conventional lasers, even in the presence of disorder, edge deformation, or local defects. Here a new class of topological lasers arising from the valley Hall edge states is proposed, which does not rely on magnetic fields. Specifically, topological lasing occurs at domain walls between two honeycomb waveguide arrays with broken spatial inversion symmetry. Two types of valley Hall edge lasing modes are found by shaping the gain landscape along the domain walls. In the presence of uniform losses and two-photon absorption, the lasing results in the formation of stable nonlinear dissipative excitations localized on the edge of the structure, even if it has complex geometry and even if it is finite. Robustness of lasing edge states is demonstrated in both periodic and finite structures, where such states can circumvent certain corners without scattering losses or radiation into the bulk, as long as the intervalley scattering is absent. The photonic structure and mechanism proposed here for topological lasing is fundamentally different from those previously employed in topological lasers, and can be used for fabrication of practical topological lasers of various geometries.

ABSTRACT: Ultra-compact topological ring-resonators with chirality are important devices for quantum optics. However, there are limited demonstrations of chiral resonators, especially in the visible region. We proposed a topological photonic ring-resonator based on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) valley photonic crystal (VPC). The spin-valley locking effect in VPC allows achieving robust unidirectional transmission of edge states in the visible region (600 nm-650 nm). As a result, a high quality factor (Q factor) (679.3) with a free spectral range of 15 nm in the visible region can be achieved in a hBN all-pass notch filter (APNF) with a compact size (2.3 mu m*2.0 mu m). In addition, we investigated the transmission properties of hBN ring-resonators with different shapes and combinations, confirming the flexibility of designing topological ring-resonators based on this principle. This design can be readily integrated with quantum photonic chips for broad applications.

ABSTRACT: Effective mass in the Dirac equation model is generally applied to condensed-matter systems for describing the state of electrons and determining the topological character. In these systems, the sign change of the effective mass is accompanied by a topological transition. Here we demonstrate that the band-gap topological property of a photonic crystal can also be related to a pseudo effective mass that is constructed by mapping Maxwell's equations to a Dirac-like equation. Then, we propose an efficient method to achieve a sign change of the pseudo effective mass by surface modification, resulting in a topological transition of the photonic crystal. Such a topological transition is confirmed by the emergence of a zero-dimensional topological bound state. We experimentally verify the theoretical predictions via colloidal photonic crystals, where a thin surface coating can lead to the topological transition. Our research provides a new avenue for the manipulation of topological properties of optical systems.

ABSTRACT: The topological state in photonics was first realized based on the magnetic-optic (MO) effect and developed rapidly in recent years. This review summarizes various topological states. First, the conventional topological chiral edge states, which are accomplished in periodic and aperiodic systems based on the MO effect, are introduced. Some typical novel topological states, including valley-dependent edge states, helical edge states, antichiral edge states, and multimode edge states with large Chern numbers in two-dimensional and Weyl points three-dimensional spaces, have been introduced. The manifest point of these topological states is the wide range of applications in wave propagation and manipulation, to name a few, one-way waveguides, isolator, slow light, and nonreciprocal Goos-Hanchen shift. This review can bring comprehensive physical insights into the topological states based on the MO effect and provides reference mechanisms for light one-way transmission and light control.

ABSTRACT: In the known field of topological photonics, what remains less so is the breakdown effect of topological phases deteriorated by perturbation. In this study, the authors investigate the variance on topological invariants for a periodic Kekule medium perturbed in unit cells, which was a gyromagnetic photonic crystal holding topological phases induced by synchronised rotation of unit cells. Two parameters for geometric and material perturbation are respectively benchmarked to characterise the topological degradation. Our calculation demonstrates that such a periodic perturbation easily destructs the topological phase and thus calls for further checkups on robustness under such unit-cell-perturbation in realisation. In our paper, the authors take the simple case of periodic randomisation by disrupting two parameters in unit cells. The authors characterise the topological breakdown via directly calculating variances to Chern numbers under their defined perturbation. Their calculation demonstrates that such a periodic perturbation easily annihilates topological invariants, providing benchmark for future design of these topological devices.image

ABSTRACT: Topological one-way edge states have attracted increasing attention because of their intriguing fundamental physics and potential applications, particularly in the realm of photonics. In this paper, we present a theoretical and numerical demonstration of topological one-way edge states in an air-hole honeycomb gyromagnetic photonic crystal biased by an external magnetic field. Localized horizontally to the edge and confined in vertical direction by two parallel metallic plates, these unique states possess robust one-way propagation characteristics. They are strongly robust against various types of defects, imperfections and sharp corners on the path, and even can unidirectionally transport along the irregular edges of arbitrary geometries. We further utilize the one-way property of edge states to overcome entirely the issue of back-reflections and show the design of topological leaky wave antennas. Our results open a new door towards the observation of nontrivial edge states in air-hole topological photonic crystal systems, and offer useful prototype of robust topological photonic devices, such as geometry-independent topological energy flux loops and topological leaky wave antennas.

ABSTRACT: This article presents a review of recent investigations of topological three-dimensional (3D) dissipative optical solitons in homogeneous laser media with fast nonlinearity of amplification and absorption. The solitons are found numerically, with their formation, by embedding two-dimensional laser solitons or their complexes in 3D space after their rotation around a vortex straight line with their simultaneous twist. After a transient, the 'hula-hoop' solitons can form with a number of closed and unclosed infinite vortex lines, i.e. the solitons are tangles in topological notation. They are attractors and are characterized by extreme stability. The solitons presented here can be realized in lasers with fast saturable absorption and are promising for information applications. The tangle solitons of the type described present an example of self-organization that can be found not only in optics but also in various distributed dissipative systems of different types. This article is part of the theme issue 'Dissipative structures in matter out of equilibrium: from chemistry, photonics and biology (part 1)'.

ABSTRACT: Data-driven approaches have been proposed as effective strategies for the inverse design and optimization of photonic structures in recent years. In order to assist data-driven methods for the design of topology of photonic devices, we propose a topological encoding method that transforms photonic structures represented by binary images to a continuous sparse representation. This sparse representation can be utilized for dimensionality reduction and dataset generation, enabling effective analysis and optimization of photonic topologies with data-driven approaches. As a proof of principle, we leverage our encoding method for the design of two dimensional non-paraxial diffractive optical elements with various diffraction intensity distributions. We proved that our encoding method is able to assist machine-learning-based inverse design approaches for accurate and global optimization.

ABSTRACT: Inspired by topological insulators in the condensed matter physics, topological photonics is a new paradigm, which is free of light backscattering at sharp waveguide bends due to the topological protection, and shows unidirectional light propagation based on the valley-chiral locking. Herein, we propose a two-channel Y-branch wavelength demultiplexer operating at the telecom band using the topological photonic integrated circuits for the first time. The proposed Y-branch wavelength demultiplexer is designed as adjoining and separating of two different topological interfaces at its input and output ports, respectively. Topological edge states with spectral interleaving can be excited in the two different topological interfaces, and be split into two output ports of the demultiplexer in short and long wavelengths. The Y-branch topological waveguide can be used as a dichroic mirror or a wavelength filter for separating light at two different wavelengths. The proposed topological inte-grated circuit is immune to structural defects. It is promising for the practical applications of optical in-terconnects and signal processing on a silicon photonic chip.

ABSTRACT: The topological phases of matter are characterized using the Berry phase, a geometrical phase associated with the energy-momentum band structure. The quantization of the Berry phase and the associated wavefunction polarization manifest as remarkably robust physical observables, such as quantized Hall conductivity and disorder-insensitive photonic transport(1-5). Recently, a novel class of topological phases, called higher-order topological phases, were proposed by generalizing the fundamental relationship between the Berry phase and quantized polarization, from dipole to multipole moments(6-8). Here, we demonstrate photonic realization of the quantized quadrupole topological phase, using silicon photonics. In our two-dimensional second-order topological phase, we show that the quantization of the bulk quadrupole moment manifests as topologically robust zero-dimensional corner states. We contrast these topological states against topologically trivial corner states in a system without bulk quadrupole moment, where we observe no robustness. Our photonic platform could enable the development of robust on-chip classical and quantum optical devices with higher-order topological protection.

ABSTRACT: It is well known that the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of a light field is conserved on propagation. In this work, in contrast to the OAM, we analytically study conservation of the topological charge (TC), which is often confused with OAM, but has quite different physical meaning. To this end, we propose a huge-ring approximation of the Huygens-Fresnel principle, when the observation point is located on an infinite-radius ring. Based on this approximation, our proof of TC conservation reveals that there exist other quantities that are also propagation-invariant, and the number of these invariants is theoretically infinite. Numerical simulation confirms the conservation of two such invariants for two light fields. The results of this work can find applications in optical data transmission to identify optical signals.

ABSTRACT: Complete suppression of reflection is in principle achievable in ideal optical systems with unique optical features including complete light absorption, abrupt phase change, etc. However, conventional optical systems have an extremely tight tolerance on fabrication errors or inherent roughness of thin films or patterns. Therefore, it is difficult to realize the perfect reflectionless condition in practice. To overcome this challenge, a topological darkness concept with mild restrictions to the film quality is proposed using periodic metallic patterns and self-assembled core-shell particles. Due to the topological effect, the robust nature of reflectionless surfaces is improved dramatically even in the presence of imperfections. Here the mild restriction will be further broken to realize reflectionless thin film systems using directly deposited thin films or random metal nanoparticles. Moreover, a broad absorption band is achieved by tuning the effective optical constants of the top absorbing layer. Remarkably, compared with conventional reflectionless phenomena under single polarization states and wavelengths, the system can realize multiwavelength zero-reflection points for both polarization states on the same chip. These proof-of-concept results pave the way toward the development of practical applications using abrupt phase change and complete light absorption for label-free optical sensing and enhanced light-matter interaction within ultrathin film systems.

ABSTRACT: The valley topological edge states (VTESs) have become a new research hotspot in topological photonics because of its flexibility and diversity. The major challenge for them comes from the limit bandwidth, the weak energy of localized field and the weak ability of direction-locked. In this paper, through the design of a triangular lattice with a compound unit cell, it is demonstrated that with the coupling of the VTESs and the defect states, some new hybrid VTESs called valley topological defect-edge states (VTDESs) occur and their performance can be greatly enhanced. Through enlarging the interval between the two lattices with opposite valley topological phases, the VTDESs absorb both the topological properties of the pure VTESs, and the properties of intense field and wide bandwidth of the defect states. The VTDESs have larger bandwidth, more intense transmission energy and the ideal ability of direction-locked. The robust transmission property against the structure obstacle has been demonstrated for the VTDESs.

ABSTRACT: The advance of topological photonics has heralded a revolution for manipulating light as well as for the development of novel photonic devices such as topological insulator lasers. Here, the robust topological interface state lasing in a polymer-cholesteric liquid crystal superlattice at the visible regime is demonstrated. By use of the femtosecond-laser direct-writing and self-assembling techniques, the micron-sized superlattice is established with a controlled mini-band structure and a topological interface defect, thereby achieving a low threshold for robust topological lasing at about 0.4 mu J (722 W center dot mm(-2)). Thanks to the chiral liquid crystal, not only is the circularly polarized lasing readily achieved, but the emission wavelength is thermally tuned. The results bring about the possibility to realize tunable, circularly polarized, compact, and integrated topological photonic devices at low cost, as well as to engineer an ideal platform for exploring topological physics that involves light-matter interaction in soft-matter environments.

ABSTRACT: This work presents a rigorous theory for topological photonic materials in one dimension. The main focus is on the existence of interface modes that are induced by topological properties of the bulk structure. For a general 1D photonic structure with time-reversal symmetry, we investigate the existence of an interface mode that is induced by a Dirac point upon perturbation. Specific-ally, we establish conditions on the perturbation which guarantee the opening of a band gap around the Dirac point and the existence of an interface mode. For a periodic photonic structure with both time-reversal and inversion sym-metry, the Zak phase is quantized, taking only two values 0, pi. We show that the Zak phase is determined by the parity (even or odd) of the Bloch modes at the band edges. For a photonic structure consisting of two semi-infinite systems on the two sides of an interface with distinct topological indices, we show the existence of an interface mode inside the common gap. The stability of the mode under perturbations is also investigated. Finally, we study resonances for finite topological structures. Our results are based on the transfer matrix method and the oscillation theory for Sturm-Liouville operators. The methods and results can be extended to general topological Sturm-Liouville systems in one dimension.

ABSTRACT: The study of topological phase transitions induced by external fields in quantum systems is of significant interest in physics, as it enables the exploration of various topological nontrivial phenomena in a controllable manner. This paper investigates the induced topological states of a graphene lattice subjected to an in-plane time-periodic electric field. The time-independent effective Hamiltonian in the high-frequency approximation is obtained under the Floquet theory. The results show that the graphene lattice can be turned into a chiral symmetric protection architectures by a specially designed periodic driving, which thus fulfills a topological phase transition. The topological invariant is found to confirm the transition in the corresponding nanoribbons. The controlled topological transition is impressively demonstrated by two distinct edge states in a nanosheet with different edges in two directions, achieved simply by adjusting the external field. This type of driven lattice, which can be easily realized in quantum photonics, shaken optical lattices, or other systems, provides a feasible theoretical foundation for experimental studies of the controllable topological phase of matter.

ABSTRACT: Topological insulators are insulating in the bulk but have metallic surface states. Its unique physicochemical properties can find numerous applications in electronics, spintronics, photonics, the energy sciences, and the signal control of transportation. We report an experimental approach to synthesize the high-quality single crystal of topological insulator Bi2Te3 by using self-flux method. We obtained the optimal preparation conditions by adjusting the parameters of heat treatment, and successfully prepared the single-crystal Bi2Te3 sample. The as-grown samples have a surface with bright metallic luster and are soft and fragile. Furthermore, Bi2Te3 has the obvious layer structure from SEM results. The data of X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscope show that Bi2Te3 single crystal grows along the c-axis with the order of Te-(1)-BiTe(2)-Bi-Te-(1) and crystallizes in the hexagonal system with space group of R/3 m. The rho-T curve shows that q decreases with temperature, showing metallic behavior over the whole temperature range.

ABSTRACT: Disorder-immune corner states in quadrupole topological photonic crystals (QTPCs) have recently attracted great attention in the community of photonics. Up to date, however, quadrupole topological systems have been investigated only in single bandgap, while multiband quadrupole ones are preferable for practical applications. In this work, we, for the first time, propose multiband QTPCs with glide symmetries. Due to the intrinsic structural symmetry, all photonic bandgaps have vanishing dipole moments and the majority of them have nontrivial quadrupole moments quantized to integer multiples of 1/4. The QTPCs have, therefore, multiple open quadrupole bandgaps for proper structural parameters, bringing forth multiband topological edge and corner states at their interfaces. In topological edge waveguide coupled with a cavity supporting corner states, the coherent coupling of topological edge and corner states results in multiple Fano resonances with high Q-factors in the order of 104. Their performances are immune to structural disorder or defects, since all photonic modes used for observing the Fano resonances are topologically protected. The presented results have fundamental importance and will find wide photonic applications such as multi-wavelength biosensing and efficient nonlinear frequency conversion.

ABSTRACT: The search for new strategies for large-scale, self-assembled arrays of soft objects is key for many applications in photonics and bottom-up manufacturing. This work shows how liquid crystal topological defects can be assembled in controlled, aperiodic arrays. In particular, the focus is on two typical examples: quasicrystals and moire patterns. Thanks to a combination of topographical cues, specifically a micropillar array and electrical switching, defects can be assembled in a quasicrystal structure, as seen from polarized optical microscopy and from diffraction patterns. In this setting, the liquid crystal defects assemble in multiple patterns that can be switched by tuning the applied electric field and retain the quasicrystalline symmetry. Using topographic cues, it is also possible to induce moire patterns of defects, characterized by a long wavelength superimposed on the periodic structures over a short scale. Even when the defect density increases and the short-scale periodicity is lost, the long-scale one remains. This work shows how versatile the combination of topographic confinement and electro-optic effect is, giving access to patterns that are otherwise difficult to realize.

ABSTRACT: "Topological photonics has emerged as a cutting-edge and intriguing field that permits electromagnetic waves to transmit with minimal losses even when they come in contact with sharp turns or imperfections or defects. In this study, we validate a strategy to realize dynamically amplitude tunable light propagation in a topological waveguide based on a three-dimensional printed valley Hall photonic crystal structure operating in the microwave frequency region. Here, tunable light propagation is facilitated by inserting an active defect in the form of a semiconductor (silicon) material slab across the domain boundary of the topological waveguide. In this configuration, dynamic variation of transmission amplitude is realized via photoexcitation of the semiconductor defect using an external laser of wavelength, & lambda & SIM 510 nm. This results in active amplitude tunability of & SIM -10 dB in topological wave propagation under a photoexcitation of 100 mW. Our demonstrated route can lead to the design of dynamically controlled topological photonic devices such as optical modulators, switches, optical buffers, etc which are important for the development of 6G communication systems."

ABSTRACT: Topological insulators (TIs) represent a novel quantum state of matter, characterized by edge or surface-states, showing up on the topological character of the bulk wave functions. Allowing electrons to move along their surface, but not through their inside, they emerged as an intriguing material platform for the exploration of exotic physical phenomena, somehow resembling the graphene Dirac-cone physics, as well as for exciting applications in optoelectronics, spintronics, nanoscience, low-power electronics, and quantum computing. Investigation of topological surface states (TSS) is conventionally hindered by the fact that in most of experimental conditions the TSS properties are mixed up with those of bulk-states. Here, we activate, probe, and exploit the collective electronic excitation of TSS in the Dirac cone. By engineering Bi2Te(3-x)Sex stoichiometry, and by gating the surface of nanoscale field-effect-transistors, exploiting thin flakes of Bi2Te2.2Se0.8 or Bi2Se3, we provide the first demonstration of room-temperature terahertz (THz) detection mediated by overdamped plasma-wave oscillations on the activated TSS of a Bi2Te2.2Se0.8 flake. The reported detection performances allow a realistic exploitation of TSS for large-area, fast imaging, promising superb impacts on THz photonics.

ABSTRACT: The preliminary study reported here investigates if unit-cell inclusion-symmetries may be broken in time-reversal-invariant topological insulator designs, while maintaining the desired global behaviour of pseudo-spin-dependent edge state based bi-directional, back-scattering robust, energy propagation. By allowing symmetries to be broken additional geometrical design freedom is attained, which may turn out to enable an improvement of various performance measures such as bandwidth and field confinement. The particular study considers a time-reversal-invariant acoustic topological insulator design, designed using a modified version of our recently proposed topology optimization based method for designing photonic and acoustic topological insulators.(1) This method relies on a carefully constructed model system combined with the application of density based topology optimization to design two carefully interfaced crystal phases to maximize the flow of energy through the system. Through simple modifications of the method, we demonstrate that it is possible to design structures with different symmetry conditions from those that have previously been investigated using the method.

ABSTRACT: A light beam reflected and refracted at a sharp interface can acquire a momentum-dependent Pancharatnam-Berry (PB) phase, which produces a topological phase transition from one kind of spin-orbit interaction (e.g., spin-controlled vortex generation) to another (e.g., photonic spin-Hall effect). However, this process is extremely inefficient and difficult to observe directly in experiments, which also hinders its applications. Here, we propose to enhance significantly the topological phase transitions by c-cut uniaxial crystals. We first give a full-wave theory to describe the spin-orbit interactions of a beam passing through a c-cut uniaxial crystal and experimentally observe the topological phase transition process of the transmitted beam when the angle between the beam propagation direction and the optical axis direction changes. It is found that the efficiency of the spin-orbit interactions caused by the momentum-dependent PB phase can be increased as high as 50%, which is much larger than that at isotropic sharp interfaces. Our findings provide an alternative approach for manipulating the spin and orbital angular momenta of light and exhibit potential applications in the future spin-orbit photonic components.

ABSTRACT: We will discuss possible applications of topological photonics to photonic integrated circuit technologies. We design nanophotonic elements based on topological edge states emerging at the exteriors of bulk structures and apply them to compact semiconductor lasers and waveguides. Such topological photonic devices are known to be immune to fabrication imperfections and therefore are suitable for building robust optical circuitry. We also address the idea of topological high-power lasers that take advantage of topological edge states for robust single mode lasing.

ABSTRACT: Dual-wavelength passively harmonic mode locking (HML) operation is demonstrated in an erbium-doped fiber laser with a microfiber-based topological insulator (TI) saturable absorber. It was found that the dual-wavelength pulse-trains possess different HML orders due to the different cavity nonlinear effects experienced by the two wavelengths. By properly adjusting the cavity parameters, dual-wavelength HML pulses with repetition rates of 388 and 239 MHz were achieved. Moreover, wavelength switchable operation of dual-wavelength HML pulses was also obtained. The experimental results reveal that the microfiber-based TI could indeed be employed as a high-performance dual-function photonic device with the saturable absorption and high nonlinear effects for the applications in fields of ultrafast and nonlinear photonics.

ABSTRACT: Surface nonlinear optics are essential for developments in integrated photonics and micro/nano optoelectronics. However, the nonlinear optical conversion efficiency on a surface is restricted by the finite nonlinear susceptibility of matter and the intrinsic atomic-layered interaction length between light and matter. In this work, based on an angular engineering strategy, it is demonstrated that the centrosymmetric topological semimetal HfGe0.92Te crystal has a giant and anisotropic surface second-order nonlinear susceptibility up to 5535 +/- 308 pm V-1 and exhibits efficient and unprecedented second-harmonic generation (SHG). The maximum optical conversion efficiency is found to be up to 3.75 parts per thousand, which is 10(4) times higher than that obtained from a silicon surface. Because of the linear dispersion over a wide range of energies around the Dirac points, this high conversion efficiency can be maintained with SHG wavelengths ranging from the visible region (779 nm) to the deep-UV region (257.5 nm). This study can facilitate the development of topological photonics and integrated nonlinear photonics based on topological semimetals.

ABSTRACT: The recent realization of topology as a mathematical concept in condensed matter systems has shattered Landau's widely accepted classification of phases by spontaneous symmetry breaking as he famously said, a particular symmetry property exists or does not exist. Topological materials (TMs) such as topological insulators and topological semimetals, are characterized by properties that depend on the topology of the band structure. Such dependence has drastic implications on the optical, electrical, and thermal properties of the material. Fundamental physics of TMs is currently under active research in condensed matter, materials science, and high energy physics. In this review, recent advances in exploiting the unique properties of TMs to realize functional optoelectronic devices are surveyed. Current and future applications that are, or may be, enabled by their unique properties are discussed. Although many theoretical ideas have been proposed over the past decade or so on using TMs in optoelectronic applications, the focus will be on experimentally realized devices.

ABSTRACT: Floquet topological insulators (FTIs) have been used to study the topological features of a dynamic quantum system within the band structure. However, it is difficult to directly observe the dynamic modulation of band structures in FTIs. Here, we implement the dynamic Su?Schrieffer?Heeger model in periodically curved waveguides to explore new behaviors in FTIs using light field evolutions. Changing the driving frequency produces near-field evolutions of light in the high-frequency curved waveguide array that are equivalent to the behaviors in straight arrays. Furthermore, at modest driving frequencies, the field evolutions in the system show boundary propagation, which are related to topological edge modes. Finally, we believe curved waveguides enable profound possibilities for the further development of Floquet engineering in periodically driven systems, which ranges from condensed matter physics to photonics.

ABSTRACT: Topological phases of matter with robust edge states have revolutionized the fundamental intuitions for wave control. The recent development of higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs) realizes even lower dimensional topological states that enable versatile wave manipulations (e.g., light imaging). However, in conventional HOTIs, the topological states are usually protected by certain crystalline symmetries and therefore bounded at specific locations, hindering their applications in modern digital ears, which often prefer tunability and reconfigurability. Here, we report the reconfigurable light imaging based on topological corner states and anti-chiral edge states in a two-dimensional (2D) photonic HOTI with a honeycomb lattice of yttrium iron garnet (YIG, a ferrite material) rods. Sublattices A and B are applied with magnetic fields in opposite directions, which realize the so-called modified Haldane model that hosts anti-chiral edge modes. By further breaking the lattice's inversion symmetry via adjusting the radii of A and B rods, topological edge states with valley degrees of freedom emerge, which not only exhibit valley-dependence but also surprisingly show anti-chiral behaviors. In the valley edge gap, which is of nontrivial higher-order topology, corner states appear. With different combinations of corner states and anti-chiral edge states, versatile reconfigurable light imaging can be realized. As examples, a multiplexing waveguide-resonator device, a pine tree imaging that can be lit up or put out at will and selective imaging for partial objects in a two-heart pattern are demonstrated. The proposed HOTI shows high potential in future intelligent devices with exciting tunable and reconfigurable functions, which may inspire a wide range of applications such as topological switching, imaging processing, and nonreciprocal integrated photonics.

ABSTRACT: We propose a straightforward and effective approach to design, by pattern-tunable strain-engineering, photonic topological insulators supporting high quality factors edge states. Chiral strain-engineering creates opposite synthetic gauge fields in two domains resulting in Landau levels with the same energy spacing but different topological numbers. The boundary of the two topological domains hosts robust time-reversal and spin-momentum-locked edge states, exhibiting high quality factors due to continuous strain modulation. By shaping the synthetic gauge field, we obtain remarkable field confinement and tunability, with the strain strongly affecting the degree of localization of the edge states. Notably, the two-domain design stabilizes the strain-induced topological edge state. The large potential bandwidth of the strain-engineering and the opportunity to induce the mechanical stress at the fabrication stage enables large scalability for many potential applications in photonics, such as tunable microcavities, new lasers, and information processing devices, including the quantum regime.

ABSTRACT: Driven by the great needs for low-cost and scalable advanced optoelectronic systems that could leverage the existing infrastructure already developed for the semiconductor industry, silicon photonics has been extensively explored as a platform with system-level integration to host numerous devices and systems with various functionalities, including lasers, modulators, filters, isolators, wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) transceivers, etc. Recently, non-Hermitian physics, which breaks the conventional scope of quantum mechanics based on Hermitian Hamiltonians, has been widely explored in the platform of silicon photonics.

ABSTRACT: Photonic structures offer unique opportunities for controlling light-matter interaction, including the photonic spin Hall effect associated with the transverse spin-dependent displacement of a light beam that propagates in specially designed optical media. However, due to small spin-orbit coupling, the photonic spin Hall effect is usually weak at the nanoscale. Here we suggest theoretically and demonstrate experimentally, in both optics and microwave experiments, the photonic spin Hall effect enhanced by topologically protected edge states in subwavelength arrays of resonant dielectric particles. Based on direct near-field measurements, we observe the selective excitation of the topological edge states controlled by the handedness of the incident light. Additionally, we reveal the main requirements to the symmetry of photonic structures to achieve the topology-enhanced spin Hall effect, and also analyse the robustness of the photonic edge states against the long-range coupling.

ABSTRACT: Topological insulators have become a hot research area in the field of acoustics in recent years, particularly the recently-appearing higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs) that support low-dimensional corner states. However, most HOTIs reported are implemented in tetragonal lattices, and only support single-frequency operation, which enables the higher-order states to be fixed at specific corners and at specific frequencies, lacking the multiband response and flexibility of switching. Herein, the experimental realization of flexibly valley-switchable topological corner states in multiple frequency bands with acoustic metamaterials in the triangular lattice are reported in a 2D system. The designed topological metamaterials, whose second-order topology is characterized by nontrivial bulk polarization, exhibit diverse topological valley-switchability in different bandgaps, as verified by simulation and experiments. Furthermore, an arbitrary structure containing complex patterns with various crossing angles is designed and experimentally implemented, where selected corners can be switched on or off by valley switching, and the switching modes are distinct in different bandgaps. The reported valley topological metamaterials enrich the fundamental understanding of the interaction between multiband higher-order topology and valley degrees of freedom, which inspire potential applications for multiband communication devices and integrated acoustics and photonics.

ABSTRACT: This work investigates the real-world value of topological protection in reciprocal photonics. Measurements of propagation losses in the slow-light regime of valley-Hall topological waveguides yield no indications of topological protection against backscattering on structural defects. The unique properties of light underpin the visions of photonic quantum technologies, optical interconnects and a wide range of novel sensors, but a key limiting factor today is losses due to either absorption or backscattering on defects. Recent developments in topological photonics have fostered the vision of backscattering-protected waveguides made from topological interface modes, but, surprisingly, measurements of their propagation losses were so far missing. Here we report on measurements of losses in the slow-light regime of valley-Hall topological waveguides and find no indications of topological protection against backscattering on ubiquitous structural defects. We image the light scattered out from the topological waveguides and find that the propagation losses are due to Anderson localization. The only photonic topological waveguides proposed for materials without intrinsic absorption in the optical domain are quantum spin-Hall and valley-Hall interface states, but the former exhibit strong out-of-plane losses, and our work, therefore, raises fundamental questions about the real-world value of topological protection in reciprocal photonics.

ABSTRACT: Significance Modulating the motions of photons through topological structures plays a primarily vital role in both scientific research and practical applications, which leads to a new but thriving study direction, namely topological photonics. Flexible topological phases and robust topological states provide an unprecedented perspective to the abundant physics phenomena generated by vector electromagnetic fields with spin-1. On the other hand, photonic artificial microstructures, such as metamaterials and photonic crystals, can be gradually perceived as substitutes and even upgrades of some complex topological models in condensed matter physics, which mainly rely on their rich state control mechanisms and highly customized design degrees of freedom. In this research process, some properties of optical topological states are utilized to overcome some engineering problems, including exploiting robustness to eliminate the scattering losses caused by defects and disorders. In view of the early success of Hermitian topological systems, recent focus has been laid on non-Hermitian topological systems described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. Especially, when the Hamiltonian of the system satisfies the parity-time (PT) symmetry, its eigenvalues are pure real, which corresponds to a unique non-Hermitian system with highly sensitive exceptional points (EPs) in the parameter space and novel skin effects in edge modes. In the past decade, wireless power transfer (WPT) and sensing become a hotspot, which triggers immense research interest in practical applications, including mobile phones, logistic robots, medical-implanted devices, and electric vehicles. For a standard WPT system, it is mainly composed of two coupled coil resonators, which are placed on the source and receiver sides, respectively. However, there are some aspects of these conventional WPT applications that should be noted. For example, the limitation of the coupling of evanescent waves and the inherent sensitivity to the transmission distance or structural disturbance restrict the structure sizes and application scenarios. With the development of WPT devices, efficient long-range and robust WPT is highly desirable but challenging. Recently, the non-Hermitian topological edge mode provides a powerful tool for near-field robust control of WPT. Therefore, it is critical to review recent works on high-performance near-field wireless power transfer and sensing systems with topological protection characteristics inspired by non-Hermitian topological effects. Progress Topological edge states of dimers can provide a suitable platform for the study of robust WPT in the radio frequency (RF) regime. On the one hand, similar to the Domino structure composed of coupled resonators for long-range WPT, the topological dimer chain can be used to realize efficient long-range WPT. On the other hand, the edge modes in nontrivial dimer chains are topologically protected, and thus the corresponding WPT is robust against the disorders and fluctuations (Figs. 3-8). At the same time, a long-range WPT can be realized through a finite quasiperiodic Harper chain based on the ultra-subwavelength coil resonators. In addition, the distribution of the asymmetric topological edge states (TESs) in the Harper chain is observed from the local density of states (LDOS) spectrum (Fig. 10). Especially, using the asymmetric topological edge states, two Chinese characters composed of light-emitting diode (LED) lamps are selectively lighted up at both ends of the chain, which intuitively show the directional WPT in the topological Harper chain (Fig. 11). Moreover, in view of the robustness of topological edge states, the designed WPT device can be robust to the disorder perturbation inside the structure. The topological edge states for directional WPT not only extend previous research work on long-range WPT but also have a circuit structure that is easier to integrate and for active control. As a result, by adding electrical variable capacitance diodes into the system, the actively tuned transmission direction by modulating the external voltages applied in variable capacitance diodes (VCDs) is experimentally observed (Fig. 12). Moreover, the properties of the EP exist in a finite non-Hermitian topological circuit-based dimer chain (Fig. 13). The coupling between two edge states is presented, which is particularly relevant to the realization of second-order EPs. By adding loss and gain to both ends of the dimer chain, the non-Hermitian topological chain and the EP that satisfies PT symmetry (Fig. 14) can be obtained. In similar systems, topological edge states are highly sensitive to disturbances in the environment before and after the EP, which lead to new highly sensitive sensors with topological protection (Fig. 15). In sharp contrast to traditional sensors, this new sensor based on non-Hermitian and topological characteristics has unique advantages. It is immune from disturbances of site-to-site couplings in the internal part of the structure and is sensitive to the perturbation of on-site frequency at the end of the structure. Conclusions and Prospect In summary, high-performance near-field WPT and sensing systems are realized with topological protection characteristics inspired by non-Hermitian topological effects. Especially, the one-dimensional system composed of resonant coils provides a simple but efficient platform to utilize the advantages of topological and non-Hermitian effects in practical applications. In addition, new topology structures with higher dimensions and higher orders are promising candidates to realize multifunctional WPTs in the future.

ABSTRACT: Optical hotspots underpin a wide variety of photonic devices ranging from sensing, nonlinear generation to photocatalysis, taking advantage of the strong light-matter interaction at the vicinity of photonic nanostructures. While plasmonic nanostructures have been widely used for strongly localized electromagnetic energy on surfaces, they suffer from high loss and consequently a low quality factor. Resonance-based dielectric structures provide an alternative solution with a larger quality factor, but there is a mismatch between the maximum values of the light confinement (quality factor) and the leakage (intensity in the near-field). Here, we propose to apply the concept of topological photonics to the formation of hotspots, producing them in both topological edge states and topological corner states. The topology secures strong light localization at the surface of the nanostructures where the underlying topological invariant shows a jump, generating a field hotspot with simultaneous increment of quality factor and light intensity. Meanwhile, it leverages a good robustness to fabrication imperfection including fluctuation in shape and misalignment. After a systematic investigation and comparison of the robustness between 1D and 2D topological structures, we conclude that the hotspots from 1D topological edge states promise a fertile playground for emerging applications that require both enhanced light intensity and high spectral resolution.

ABSTRACT: If a vortex propagation-invariant beam is given by all its intensity nulls, then its topological charge (TC) can be defined easily: its TC is equal to the sum of topological charges of all optical vortices in these intensity nulls. If, however, a propagation-invariant beam is given as a superposition of several light fields, then determining its TC is a complicated task. Here, we derive the topological charges of four different types of propagation-invariant beams, represented as axial superpositions of Hermite-Gaussian beams with different amplitudes and different phase delays. In particular, topological charges are obtained for such beam families as the Hermite-Laguerre-Gaussian (HLG) beams and two-parametric vortex Hermite beams. We show that the TC is a quantity resistant to changing certain beam parameters. For instance, when the parameters theta and alpha of the HLG beams are altered, the beam intensity also changes significantly, but the TC remains unchanged.

ABSTRACT: The emergence of higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs) has greatly expanded the family of topological materials. While the co-dimensional bulk-boundary correspondence is observed in platforms, such as acoustics and photonics, realizing three-dimensional (3D) photonic HOTIs is relatively challenging due to the complex properties of electromagnetic waves such as polarizations, scattering, and refractive index. In this paper, a photonic HOTI with a simple multilayer structure that supports higher-order hinge states is proposed. By inserting a central metallic pillar in the unit cell, the 3D bandgap can be well extended, enabling pure and distinguishable surface and hinge modes. The lattice is reconfigurable and flexible, allowing for hinge and surface waves to be generated by controlling the geometrical length of sub-lattices. The idea of distinguished higher-order hinge modes is also extended to enlarged higher-orbital bandgaps. Furthermore, by introducing a central disclination in this photonic model, the one-dimensional (1D) vertical disclination mode is obtained which is not seen in existing photonic HOTIs. The findings open the door for a high-performance topological optical apparatus that features efficient one-way light propagation and energy concentration. A photonic higher-order topological insulator with a piling framework hosting hinge states is proposed. By inserting a metallic pillar in the lattice, the three-dimensional bandgap is extended, enabling distinguishable topological modes at lower- and higher-orbital bandgaps. Also, the introduction of geometrical defects makes this reconfigurable architecture supporting vertical disclination state, allowing for multimode waves to be generated at varying dimensions.image

ABSTRACT: Photonic topological materials with a broken time-reversal symmetry are characterized by nontrivial topological phases, such that they do not support propagation in the bulk region but forcibly support a nontrivial net number of unidirectional edge-states when enclosed by an opaque-type boundary, e.g., an electric wall. The Haldane model played a central role in the development of topological methods in condensed-matter systems, as it unveiled that a broken time-reversal symmetry is the essential ingredient to have a quantized electronic Hall phase. Recently, it was proved that the magnetic field of the Haldane model can be imitated in photonics with a spatially varying pseudo-Tellegen coupling. Here, we use Green's function method to determine from first principles  the band diagram and the topological invariants of the photonic Haldane model, implemented as a Tellegen photonic crystal. Furthermore, the topological phase diagram of the system is found, and it is shown with first principles calculations that the granular structure of the photonic crystal can create nontrivial phase transitions controlled by the amplitude of the pseudo-Tellegen parameter.

ABSTRACT: The topological features of optical vortices have been opening opportunities for free-space and on-chip photonic technologies, e.g., for multiplexed optical communications and robust information transport. In a parallel but disjoint effort, polar anisotropic van der Waals nanomaterials supporting hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HP2s) have been leveraged to drastically boost light-matter interactions. So far HP2 studies have been mainly focusing on the control of their amplitude and scale features. Here we report the generation and observation of mid-infrared hyperbolic polariton vortices (HP2Vs) associated with reconfigurable topological charges. Spiral-shaped gold disks coated with a flake of hexagonal boron nitride are exploited to tailor spin-orbit interactions and realise deeply subwavelength HP2Vs. The complex interplay between excitation spin, spiral geometry and HP2 dispersion enables robust reconfigurability of the associated topological charges. Our results reveal unique opportunities to extend the application of HP2s into topological photonics, quantum information processing by integrating these phenomena with single-photon emitters, robust on-chip optical applications, sensing and nanoparticle manipulation.

ABSTRACT: After more than 70 years of development, holography has become an essential tool of modern optics in many applications. In fact, for various applications of different kinds of holographic techniques, stability and antijamming ability are very important. Here, optical topological structures are introduced into holographic technology, and an entirely new concept of optical topological holography is demonstrated to solve stability and antijamming problems. Based on the optical knots and links, the topological holography is not only developed in theory, but also demonstrated experimentally. In addition, a new topological holographic coding is established by regarding each knotted/linked topological structure as an information carrier. Due to the variety of knotted and linked structures and their characteristics of topological protection, such coding can have high capacity as well as robust properties. Furthermore, with writing the hologram into the liquid crystal, robust information storage of 3D topological holography is realized.

ABSTRACT: Originating from the investigation of condensed matter states, the concept of quantum Hall effect and quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE) has recently been expanded to other field of physics and engineering, e.g., photonics and phononics, giving rise to strikingly unconventional edge modes immune to scattering. Here, we present the plasmonic analog of QSHE in graphene plasmonic crystal (GPC) in mid-infrared frequencies. The band inversion occurs when deforming the honeycomb lattice GPCs, which further leads to the topological band gaps and pseudospin features of the edge states. By overlapping the band gaps with different topologies, we numerically simulated the pseudospin-dependent one-way propagation of edge states. The designed GPC may find potential applications in the fields of topological plasmonics and trigger the exploration of the technique of the pseudospin multiplexing in high-density nanophotonic integrated circuits.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics is an incipient research area where the well-developed theory and applications of so-called topological insulators is applied to photonic systems. In that vein, specially-designed ring waveguides, arranged in a periodic structure and evanescently coupled, have shown the ability to propagate edge states that are robust against defects in the lattice. Here, we propose the application of photonic topologically-protected edge states (TPES) in the anomalous Floquet photonic topological insulator structures to develop a device that is able to behave as OR, AND, and XOR logic gates, depending on the characteristics of the excitation field. Materials and dimensions of the device are amenable to conventional fabrication methods, opening the possibility for implementation in on-chip photonic communication technology. We conclude by applying our results to the implementation of an all-optical two bit calculator based on TPES, a potential building block for future computational technology.

ABSTRACT: Nanomaterials with outstanding optical properties are widely used in ultrafast photonics. Especially, metal nanomaterials have attracted increasing attention in recent years owing to the surface plasmon resonance that further enhances their nonlinear optical response, making them suitable for generating ultrafast pulses in a wide range of wavebands.

ABSTRACT: We derive the continuous-time limit of discrete quantum walks with topological phases. We show the existence of a continuous-time limit that preserves their topological phases. We consider both simple-step and split step walks, and derive analytically equations of motion governing their behavior. We obtain simple analytical solutions showing the existence of bound states at the boundary of two phases, and solve the equations of motion numerically in the bulk.

ABSTRACT: Robust multiband photonic topological edge states are of great importance for photonic applications, including nonlinear wavelength conversion. In particular, higher-order photonic topological states provide the realizability of photonic nanoresonators with high robustness against structural disorder of photonic crystals. This work reveals that multiband photonic topological valley-Hall edge states and second-order corner states can be observed in square lattice photonic crystals consisting of triangular dielectric rods. For small sizes of the triangles, multiband gapless edge modes propagate through the photonic topological waveguide. Their transmission characteristics and robustness against the structural defects have been evaluated for linear and Z-shaped interfaces. When the size of the triangles increases, most of edge bands become gapped and one can obtain disorder-immune multiband second-order topological corner states, which is the core result of this report. The results obtained in this work can find important applications for nonlinear topological frequency conversion.

ABSTRACT: The nature of spin transport in the bulk and side surface of three-dimensional topological insulator thin film geometry is a relatively unexplored subject, compared to the extensively studied top and bottom surface states. Here we employ time-and space-resolved helicity-dependent photocurrent measurements to investigate the effect of optically excited bulk carriers on the spin-polarized topological side surface conduction. Time-resolved femtosecond double-pulse excitation reveals that the spin current toward the side surface arises from the bulk-originated spin Hall effect (SHE), whose microscopic origin is governed by an Elliott Yafet-type spin relaxation mechanism via an extrinsic side jump process. Bias-and temperature-dependent measurements further confirm that the spin scattering in Bi2Se3 has multiple sources including impurity and electron phonon scattering. The SHE-assisted side surface spin conduction shows an exceptionally high charge-to-spin conversion efficiency of 35% at 77 K, which may offer new spintronic applications of topological insulators such as spin orbit torque or spin-flip controlled light-emitting devices.

ABSTRACT: A novel design of the Fabry-Perot optical cavity is proposed, utilizing both the topological interface state structures and photonic bandgap materials with a controllable reflection phase. A one-to-one correspondence between the traditional Fabry-Perot cavity and optical topological cavity is found, while the tunable reflection phase of the photonic crystal mirrors provides an extra degree of freedom on cavity mode selection. The relationship between the Zak phase and photonic bandgap provides theoretical guidance to the manipulation of the reflection phase of photonic crystals. The dispersions of interface states with different topology origins are explored. Linear interfacial dispersion emerging in photonic crystals with the valley-spin Hall effect leads to an extra n = 0 cavity mode compared to the Zak phase-induced deterministic interface states with quadratic dispersion. The frequency of the n = 0 cavity mode is not affected by the cavity length, whose quality factor can also be tuned by the thickness of the photonic crystal mirrors. With the recent help of topology photonics in the tuning reflection phase and dispersion relationship, we hope our results can provide more intriguing ideas to construct topological optical devices.

ABSTRACT: Here the authors provide the experimental observation of a topological rainbow in a silicon-based nanophotonic chip. The system is robust against disorders allows to separate and trap topological photonic states of different wavelength into different positions. The era of Big Data requires nanophotonic chips to have large information processing capacity. Multiple frequency on-chip nanophotonic devices are highly desirable for density integration, but such devices are more susceptible to structural imperfection because of their nano-scale. Topological photonics provides a robust platform for next-generation nanophotonic chips. Here we give an experimental report of an on-chip nanophotonic topological rainbow realized by employing a translational deformation freedom as a synthetic dimension. The topological rainbow can separate, slow, and trap topological photonic states of different frequencies into different positions. A homemade scattering scanning near-field optical microscope with high resolution is introduced to directly measure the topological rainbow effect of the silicon-based photonic chip. The topological rainbow based on synthetic dimension have no restrictions for optical lattice types, symmetries, materials, wavelength band, and is easy for on-chip integration. This work builds a bridge between silicon chip technologies and topological photonics.

ABSTRACT: Manipulating radiation is important for a variety of optoelectronic applications, such as on-chip lasers, energy-efficient grating couplers, and antennas for light detection and ranging. Although designing and optimizing those optoelectronic devices are usually believed to be an engineering-oriented task, recent research reveals that the principles underlying radiation manipulation are closely connected to the concept of topology-the study of properties that are invariant under continuous deformations. In this review, we summarize a series of advances of the physics, phenomena, and applications related to radiation manipulation, in which topological concepts were adopted. Radiation could carry energy escaping from the system, breaking the energy conservation. The non-Hermiticity of such systems brings quite different physical consequences when comparing with the Hermitian counterparts and, hence, also results in the emergence of many interesting and extraordinary phenomena. In particular, it is found that the perfect trapping of light can still be realized in such non-Hermitian systems because of the photonic realization of bound states in the continuum. The fundamental nature of bound states in the continuum has been identified to be topological: they are essentially topological defects of the polarization vector field in momentum space, depicted by a kind of topological invariant named topological charges. Therefore, manipulation of radiation channels can be realized by controlling the topological charge evolution in momentum space. It is also demonstrated that the photonic states accompanied with different topological charges generate vortex beams with unique far-field radiation patterns, and ultra-fast switching of such vortex beams is demonstrated according to this principle. The progresses of topological photonics upon light radiation show that the topology is not just mathematical convenience for depicting photonic systems, but has brought realistic consequences in manipulating light and will boost the applications of photonics and optoelectronics in many aspects.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonic systems provide a novel platform for controlling the flow of light. Recently, valley photonic crystals have been favored for their friendly of implement. Here, we demonstrate the chiral-selective terahertz transmission in a valley photonic crystal comprised of dielectric rods. The unidirectional propagation of chiral edge states indicated by the slope of energy band dispersion is numerically observed. The proposed regime has potential in multi-functional photonic broadband communication and other on-chip applications in the terahertz region, particularly for 6G communications.

ABSTRACT: In recent years, there has been considerable interest in the study of wave propagation in nonlinear photonic lattices. The interplay between nonlinearity and periodicity has led researchers to manipulate light and discover new and interesting phenomena such as new classes of localized modes, usually referred to as solitons, and novel surface states that propagate robustly. A field where both nonlinearity and periodicity arises naturally is nonlinear optics. But there are other areas where waves propagating on background lattices play an important role, including photonic crystal fibers and Bose-Einstein condensation. In this review article the propagation of wave envelopes in one and two-dimensional periodic lattices associated with additional potential in the nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation, termed lattice NLS equations, are studied. A discrete reduction, known as the tight-binding approxima-tion, is employed to find the linear dispersion relation and the equations governing nonlinear discrete envelopes for two-dimensional simple periodic lattices and two-dimensional non-simple honeycomb lattices. In the limit under which the envelopes vary slowly, continuous envelope equations are derived from the discrete system. The coefficients of the linear evolution system are related to the dispersion relation in both the discrete and continuous cases. For simple lattices, the continuous systems are NLS type equations. In honeycomb lattices, in certain cases, the continuous system is found to be nonlinear Dirac equations. Finally, it is possible to realize so-called topological insulator systems in an optical waveguide setting. The modes supported by these systems are associated with spectral topological invariants and, remarkably, can propagate without backscatter from lattice defects. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Topological edge states have attracted great attention for their exotic properties such as the asymmetrical light propagation, which can be exploited in many application areas especially in integrated photonics. In this work, we propose the design of a novel structure that supports topological edge states residing inside the bulk bands. The purely dielectric structure comprises two reversed two-dimensional photonic crystals (PCs) with the simplest triangular lattices. As the energy of the p and d orbits in the two PCs are reversed, the topologically trivial and non-trivial states can directly be formed without any intermediate transition required. The topological edge states occur at the interface between the two PCs, in analogy to the quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect in electronic systems. Due to the unique configuration, the edge states can extend themselves into the semi-bulk bands and become the embedded topological edge states, which breaks the constraint that the edge states can only exist inside the band gap. Our simulation results have demonstrated the existence of the pseudospin states and the spin-locked propagation with topological protection. A spin locked unidirectional transmission of topological edge states along the direction of Gamma K Gamma M or Gamma M Gamma K has also been demonstrated, respectively, in a compound structure.

ABSTRACT: Topology describes properties that remain unaffected by smooth distortions. Its main hallmark is the emergence of edge states localized at the boundary between regions characterized by distinct topological invariants. Because their properties are inherited from the topology of the bulk, these edge states present a strong immunity to distortions of the underlying architecture. This feature offers new opportunities for robust trapping of light in nano-and micrometre-scale systems subject to fabrication imperfections and environmentally induced deformations. Here, we report lasing in such topological edge states of a one-dimensional lattice of polariton micropillars that implements an orbital version of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Hamiltonian. We further demonstrate that lasing in these states persists under local deformations of the lattice. These results open the way to the implementation of chiral lasers in systems with broken time-reversal symmetry and, when combined with polariton interactions, to the study of nonlinear phenomena in topological photonics.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics and topological photonic states have opened up a new frontier for optical manipulation and robust light trapping. The topological rainbow can separate different frequencies of topological states into different positions. This work combines a topological photonic crystal waveguide (topological PCW) with the optical cavity. The dipole and quadrupole topological rainbows are realized through increasing cavity size along the coupling interface. The flatted band can be obtained by increasing cavity length due to interaction strength between the optical field and defected region material which is extensively promoted. The light propagation through the coupling interface is built on the evanescent overlapping mode tails of the localized fields between bordering cavities. Thus, the ultra-low group velocity is realized at a cavity length more than the lattice constant, which is appropriate for realizing an accurate and precise topological rainbow. Hence, this is a novel release for strong localization with robust transmission and owns the possibility to realize high-performance optical storage devices.

ABSTRACT: Far-field optical beam steering is a fast-growing technology for communications, spatial ranging, and detections. Nonmechanical optical phased arrays based on straight waveguides have been studied recently, where the beam emission angle to the propagation axis can be scanned by conveniently tuning the wavelength. However, the dispersion of the waveguide limits the wavelength sensitivity of beam steering and the deliberately created emitters inevitably introduce in-line backscattering on-chip. To overcome these limitations, here, we report a robust and back-reflection-free topological photonic integrated circuit, where different functionalities, such as beam splitting, routing, and far-field steering, are defined by strategic arrangements of lattices with different topological modulations simply controlled by a single lattice deformation parameter. Benefiting from the robust topological scheme, an extra band flattening is applied to achieve far-field steering with high wavelength sensitivity.

ABSTRACT: In recent years, the topological edge states (TESs) and topological corner states (TCSs) based on high-order topological photonic insulators have been researched and applied in various fields. Among them, the combination of topological photonics and waveguide-cavity coupling system has attracted much attention of researchers. In this paper, TESs and TCSs based on Kagome lattice photonic crystals (PCs) with rectangular dielectric columns are obtained. In addition, a topological waveguide-cavity coupling system is proposed, realizing the energy coupling between the TES waveguide and the TCS cavity. To further improve the performance of the system, a sandwich-like waveguide and an extended waveguide are used to replace the original TES waveguide. Interestingly, the proposed extended waveguide-cavity coupling system cannot only achieve the excitation of two TCSs at different frequencies, but also has stronger electric field intensity, narrower resonance bandwidth, and higher quality factor than the other structures. This work provides a new path to design high-performance micro-nanointegrated optical devices such as filters, lasers, and resonators. A topological waveguide-cavity coupling system is constructed, realizing the energy coupling between the waveguide and cavity, Fano resonance phenomenon can be observed in this system. Moreover, an extended waveguide-cavity coupling system is proposed, having stronger electric field intensity, narrower resonance bandwidth, and higher quality factor. This work provides a new path to design high-performance micro-nano-integrated optical devices.image

ABSTRACT: Metasurfaces refer to planarized ultrathin metamaterials which promise an effective approach to control not only waves in the free space hut also surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) which is an attractive form of electromagnetic waves propagating along the interface between typical metals and dielectrics. Topological transition metasurfaces have emerged as a fascinating platform to control SPPs. In this work, we propose topological transition metasurfaces for achieving anomalous terahertz surface wave propagation. Combining different complementary H-shape resonators, we observe anomalous wave propagation at the interface where eigenmode of the resonator experiences topological transition. The proposed metasurfaces open unprecedented venues for anomalous surface wave propagation and guidance which show great capabilities for designing photonic devices.

ABSTRACT: Valley-Hall phases, first proposed in 2D materials, originate from nontrivial topologies around valleys which denote local extrema in momentum space. Since they have been extended into classical systems, their designs draw inspirations from existing quantum counterparts, and their transports show similar topological protections. In contrast, it has been recently established in acoustics that layer pseudospins in valley-Hall phases can give rise to special valley-Hall edge states with fundamentally different transport behaviors at the interfaces compared with various 2D materials. Their realization in other classical systems, such as photonics, would allow to design topological insulators beyond quantum inspirations. Here, it is shown that layer pseudospins exist in photonic valley-Hall phases, using vertically coupled designer surface plasmon crystals, a nonradiative system in open environment supporting tightly confined propagating modes. The negligible thermal and radiative losses in the structure pave the way for the direct observations of the layer pseudospins and associated topological phenomena stem from them in both real and reciprocal spaces. Photonic devices that manipulate the signals based on the layer pseudospins of the topological phases, such as layer convertors and layer-selected delay lines, are experimentally demonstrated, confirming the potential applications of the layer pseudospins as a new degree of freedom carrying information.

ABSTRACT: Nonlinear topological photonics has been attracting increasing research interest, as it provides an exciting photonic platform that combines the advantages of active all-optical control offered by nonlinear optics with the unique features of topological photonic systems, such as topologically-protected defect-immune light propagation. In this paper, we demonstrate that topological interface modes and trivial edge modes of a specially designed graphene metasurface can be coupled in a tunable and optically controllable manner, thus providing an efficient approach to transfer optical power to topologically protected states. This is achieved in a pump-signal configuration, in which an optical pump propagating in a bulk mode of the metasurface is employed to tune the band structure of the photonic system and, consequently, the coupling coefficient and wave-vector mismatch between edge and topological interface modes. This tunable coupling mechanism is particularly efficient due to the large Kerr coefficient of graphene. Importantly, we demonstrate that the required pump power can be significantly reduced if the optical device is operated in the slow-light regime. We perform our analysis using both ab initio full-wave simulations and a coupled-mode theory that captures the main physics of this active coupler and observe a good agreement between the two approaches. This work may lead to the design of active topological photonic devices with new or improved functionality.

ABSTRACT: Since the mid- (2-20 mu m) and far-infrared (20-1000 mu m) regions cover the vibration and rotation characteristic fingerprint spectra of many gas molecules and three atmospheric transmission windows (2-2.5 mu m, 3.5-5 mu m and 8-14 mu m), the mid- and far-infrared pulsed laser sources and novel photonic devices have been widely applied, such as molecular spectroscopy, materials processing, gas sensing, free-space communications, and medicine. Low-dimensional materials exhibit great potential in mid- and far-infrared pulsed laser and photonic devices because of their high third-order nonlinear coefficient, ultrafast carrier dynamics, and excellent optics and electricity properties. However, relatively little is known of low-dimensional materials-based mid- and far-infrared photonics, and a review of the fabrication and properties of low-dimensional materials in mid- and far-infrared photonics has not been reported. In this contribution, this review starts with an introduction to the synthesis and optical response of low-dimensional materials. In the following sections, the developments of low-dimensional materials-based mid- and far-infrared photonics are comprehensively summarized, including pulsed lasers, optical modulators, and photodetectors. Finally, perspectives and challenges regarding the design of low-dimensional materials-based photonics are provided. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: We study a one-dimensional plasmonic system with nontrivial topology: a chain of metallic nanoparticles with alternating spacing, which in the limit of small particles is the plasmonic analogue to the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. Unlike prior studies we take into account long-range hopping with retardation and radiative damping, which is necessary for the scales commonly used in plasmonics experiments. This leads to a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian with frequency dependence that is notably not a perturbation of the quasistatic model. We show that the resulting band structures are significantly different, but that topological features such as quantized Zak phase and protected edge modes persist because the system has the same eigenmodes as a chirally symmetric system. We discover the existence of retardation-induced topological phase transitions, which are not predicted in the SSH model. We find parameters that lead to protected edge modes and confirm that they are highly robust under disorder, opening up the possibility of protected hotspots at topological interfaces that could have novel applications in nanophotonics.

ABSTRACT: Second-harmonic generation and third-harmonic generation have been widely investigated in nonlinear topological photonics. However, due to the weak nonlinear effect and the strict phase matching condition, it is a challenge to observe the high-order harmonic generation in general bulky or periodic structures. In this work, through the design of a binary one-dimensional photonic crystal, we obtain the topological edge states (TESs) with equal frequency spacing based on the electro-optic modulation effect. The designed structure has generated the high-order harmonic waves with the nonlinear effect excited by intense femtosecond laser pulses. The uniformly distributed TESs satisfy the request of phase matching. The nonlinear sum-frequency effect combined with the unique TESs leads to high-order harmonic waves. The presented work provides a feasible scheme to generate the high-order harmonic waves from the simple 1D structure.

ABSTRACT: Physical systems exhibiting topological invariants are naturally endowed with robustness against perturbations, as manifested in topological insulators-materials exhibiting robust electron transport, immune from scattering by defects and disorder. Recent years have witnessed intense efforts toward exploiting these phenomena in photonics. Here we demonstrate a nonmagnetic topological insulator laser system exhibiting topologically protected transport in the cavity. Its topological properties give rise to single-mode lasing, robustness against defects, and considerably higher slope efficiencies compared to the topologically trivial counterparts. We further exploit the properties of active topological platforms by assembling the system from S-chiral microresonators, enforcing predetermined unidirectional lasing without magnetic fields. This work paves the way toward active topological devices with exciting properties and functionalities.

ABSTRACT: The principles of topology in condensed matter physics have expanded to areas such as photonics, acoustics, electronics, and mechanics. Their extension to dynamic (soft) matter could enable the control and design of topological thermodynamic (micro)states and nonreciprocal dynamics, potentially leading to paradigmatic applications in molecular and thermal waveguiding, logics, and energy management. This Perspective explores distinct topological concepts for dynamic matter and prospective function. Topological tools are exemplified and discussed for the study of nonlocal order parameters or invariants in dynamic molecular matter, toward the engineering of assemblies, reactions, and system chemistry with unconventional global properties-a scope which has the potential to push the frontiers of physical chemistry and transform chemical topology from form to function.

ABSTRACT: Topological insulator materials have attracted greater attention in recent years due to their conducting surface state and insulating bulk state. The unique surface states in topological insulators offer potential applications in photonics and optoelectronics. Herein, topological insulators' near-infrared plasmonic behavior is utilized to demonstrate a tunable double-mode absorber that shows an electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT)-like effect. A composite structure is formed by sandwiching a photonic crystal heterostructure between topological insulator layers. The transfer matrix method is used to examine the optical response. The evolution of the modes with changes in layer thicknesses, grating period number, and propagating angle is also investigated. The study is further extended to multichannel optical absorption by making changes in the composite structure period, and the resultant absorption spectrum shows a multichannel EIT-like effect.

ABSTRACT: "Waveguides and resonators are core components in the large-scale integration of electronics, photonics and phononics, both in existing and future scenarios. In certain situations, there is critical coupling of the two components  i.e. no energy passes through the waveguide after the incoming wave couples into the resonator. The transmission spectral characteristics resulting from this phenomenon are highly advantageous for signal filtering, switching, multiplexing and sensing. In the present study, adopting an elastic-wave platform, we introduce topological insulator (TI), a remarkable achievement in condensed matter physics over the past decade, into a classical waveguide-ring-resonator configuration. Along with basic similarities with classical systems, a TI system has important differences and advantages, mostly owing to the spin-momentum locked transmission states at the TI boundaries. As an example, a two-port TI waveguide resonator can fundamentally eliminate upstream reflections while completely retaining useful transmission spectral characteristics, and maximize the energy in the resonator, with possible applications being novel signal processing, gyro/sensing, lasering, energy harvesting and intense wave-matter interactions, using phonons, photons or even electrons. The present work further enhances confidence in using topological protection for practical device performance and functionalities, especially considering the crucial advantage of introducing (pseudo)spins to existing conventional configurations. More in-depth research on advancing phononics/photonics, especially on-chip, is foreseen."

ABSTRACT: Parity-time (PT) symmetry, originally conceived for non-Hermitian open quantum systems, has opened an exciting avenue towards coherent control of light for significant applications. Here we propose a paradigm towards non-Hermitian photonics based on the charge-parity (CP) symmetry, in which the charge conjugation and parity symmetries are broken individually but preserved jointly. Such a symmetry-breaking scheme induces a transition from dielectric to hyperbolic dispersions in chiral dielectrics, leading to lossless all-dielectric hyperbolic metamaterials. More interestingly, the CP-symmetry transition represents a non-Hermitian topological phase transition that occurs at infinite energy and requires no explicit band gap closing. We further showcase broad applications of CP-symmetric photonics such as an all-angle polarization-dependent beam splitter and enhanced spontaneous emission. The CP symmetry opens an unexplored pathway for non-Hermitian topological photonics by bringing new physics into strong chiral metamaterials, therefore providing a powerful tool for engineering many promising applications in photonics and other related fields.

ABSTRACT: Recent advances in manipulating topological phases in quantum systems have promised integrated quantum devices with conspicuous functionalities, such as robustness against fabrication defects. At the same time, the introduction of quantum frequency combs enables extreme expansion of quantum resources. Here, it theoretically propose the generation of high-dimensional entangled quantum frequency combs via four-wave mixing processes in the valley-Hall topological resonators. Specifically, it demonstrates two irregular photonic crystal resonators supporting the whispering-gallery resonator modes that lead to coherent quantum frequency combs at telecommunication wavelengths. By using the Schmidt decomposition, It shows that the quantum frequency combs are frequency entangled, and it also concludes that the effective dimensions of quantum frequency combs in these two resonators are at least seven and six, respectively. Moreover, these quantum frequency combs inherit the topological protection of valley kink states, showing robustness against defects in the resonators. The topological quantum frequency combs have shown intriguing potentiality in the generation and control of topologically protected high-dimensional quantum states in integrated photonic crystal platforms. Topological quantum frequency comb is a burgeoning topic that combines topological phases and quantum systems, which inspires many intriguing sparks in topological quantum optics. Producing quantum frequency combs in valley photonic crystal topological resonators can introduce the robustness to quantum states in integrated photonic devices.image

ABSTRACT: Here we theoretically obtain values of the topological charge (TC) for vortex laser beams devoid of radial symmetry: asymmetric Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beams, Bessel-Gaussian (BG) beams, Kummer beams, and vortex Hermite-Gaussian (HG) beams. All these beams consist of conventional modes, namely, LG, BG, or HG modes, respectively. However, all these modes have the same TC equal to that of a single constituent mode n. Orbital angular momenta (OAM) of all these beams, normalized to the beam power, are different and changing differently with varying beam asymmetry. However, for arbitrary beam asymmetry, TC remains unchanged and equals n. Superposition of just two HG modes with the adjacent numbers (n, n + 1) and with the phase retardation of pi/2 yields a modal beam with the TC equal to - (2n + 1). Numerical simulation confirms the theoretical predictions.

ABSTRACT: Acoustic resonant cavities play a vital role in modern acoustical systems. The ultrahigh quality-factor resonances are highly desired for some applications such as high-resolution acoustic sensors and acoustic lasers. Here, a class of supercavity resonances is theoretically proposed and experimentally demonstrated in a coupled acoustic resonator system, arising from the merged bound states in the continuum (BICs) in geometry space. Their topological origin is demonstrated by explicitly calculating their topological charges before and after BIC merging, accompanied by charges annihilation. Compared with other types of BICs, they are robust to the perturbation brought by fabrication imperfection. Moreover, it is found that such supercavity modes can be linked with the Friedrich-Wintgen BICs supported by an entire rectangular (cuboid) resonator sandwiched between two rectangular (or circular) waveguides and thus more supercavity modes are constructed. Then, these coupled resonators are fabricated and such a unique phenomenon-moving, merging, and vanishing of BICs-is experimentally confirmed by measuring their reflection spectra, which show good agreement with the numerical simulation and theoretical prediction of mode evolution. The results may find exciting applications in acoustic and photonics, such as enhanced acoustic emission, filtering, and sensing.

ABSTRACT: In this work we analytically investigate the longitudinal optical conductivity of the C-2v symmetric topological insulator. The conductivity expressions at T = 0 are derived using the Kubo formula and expressed as a function of the ratio of the Dresselhaus and Rashba parameters that characterize the low-energy Hamiltonian. We find that the longitudinal inter-band conductivity vanishes when Dresselhaus and Rashba parameters are equal in strength, also called the persistent spin helix state. The calculations are extended to obtain the frequency-dependent real and imaginary components of the optical conductivity for the topological Kondo insulator SmB6 which exhibits C-2v symmetric and anisotropic Dirac cones hosting topological states at (X) over bar point on the surface Brillouin zone.

ABSTRACT: Following the realization of Weyl semimetals in quantum electronic materials, classical wave analogues of Weyl materials have also been theorized and experimentally demonstrated in photonics and acoustics. Weyl points in elastic systems, however, have been a much more recent discovery. In this study, we report on the design of an elastic fully-continuum three-dimensional material that, while offering structural and load-bearing functionalities, is also capable of Weyl degeneracies and surface topologically-protected modes in a way completely analogous to its quantum mechanical counterpart. The topological characteristics of the lattice are obtained byab initionumerical calculations without employing any further simplifications. The results clearly characterize the topological structure of the Weyl points and are in full agreement with the expectations of surface topological modes. Finally, full field numerical simulations are used to confirm the existence of surface states and to illustrate their extreme robustness towards lattice disorder and defects.

ABSTRACT: Photonic topological insulators provide a route for disorder-immune light transport, which holds promise for practical applications. Flexible reconfiguration of topological light pathways can enable high-density photonics routing, thus sustaining the growing demand for data capacity. By strategically interfacing non-Hermitian and topological physics, we demonstrate arbitrary, robust light steering in reconfigurable non-Hermitian junctions, in which chiral topological states can propagate at an interface of the gain and loss domains. Our non-Hermitian-controlled topological state can enable the dynamic control of robust transmission links of light inside the bulk, fully using the entire footprint of a photonic topological insulator.

ABSTRACT: Metasurfaces are subwavelength structured thin films consisting of arrays of units that allow the control of polarization, phase, and amplitude of light over a subwavelength thickness. Recent developments in topological photonics have greatly broadened the horizon in designing metasurfaces for novel functional applications. In this review, we summarize recent progress in the research field of topological metasurfaces, first from the perspectives of passive and active in the classical regime, and then in the quantum regime. More specifically, we begin by examining the passive topological phenomena in two-dimensional photonic systems, including both time-reversal broken systems and time-reversal preserved systems. Subsequently, we discuss the cutting-edge studies of active topological metasurfaces, including nonlinear topological metasurfaces and reconfigurable topological metasurfaces. After overviewing topological metasurfaces in the classical regime, we show how they could provide a new platform for quantum information and quantum many-body physics.

ABSTRACT: Three-dimensional (3D) topological insulators are a new state of quantum matter that are insulating in the bulk but have current-carrying massless Dirac surface states. Nanostructured topological insulators, such as quasi-two-dimensional (2D) nanoribbons, nanoplates, and ultrathin films with extremely large surface-to-volume ratios, distinct edge/surface effects, and unique physicochemical properties, can have a large impact on fundamental research as well as in applications such as electronics, spintronics, photonics, and the energy sciences. Few-layer topological insulator nanostructures have very large surface-to-volume ratios that can significantly enhance the contribution of exotic surface states, and their unique quasi-2D geometry also facilitates their integration into functional devices for manipulation and manufacturing. Here, we present our recent results on the controlled growth of quasi-2D nanostructures of topological insulators, as well as their novel functional devices. High quality quasi-2D nanostructures of Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3 topological insulators have been synthesized by vapor-phase growth. Ultra-thin nanoplates of the topological insulators with uniform thickness down to a single layer have been grown on various substrates, including conductive graphene. A facile, high-yield method has been developed for growing single-crystal nanoplate arrays of Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3 with well-aligned orientations, controlled thickness, and specific placement on mica substrates by van der Waals epitaxy. A systematic spectroscopic study, including angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), micro-Raman spectroscopy, and micro-infrared spectroscopy, was carried out to investigate the quasi-2D nanostructures of topological insulators. Pronounced Aharonov-Bohm (AB) interference effects were observed in the topological insulator nanoribbons, providing direct transport evidence of the robust, conducting surface states. Transport measurements of a single nanoplate device, with a high-k dielectric top gate, showed a significant decrease in the carrier concentration and a large tuning of the chemical potential with electrical gating. We also present the first experimental demonstration of near-infrared transparent flexible electrodes based on few-layer topological insulator Bi2Se3 nanostructures that was epitaxially grown on a mica substrate by van der Waals epitaxy. Topological insulator nanostructures show promise as transparent flexible electrodes because of their good near-infrared transparency and excellent conductivity, which is robust against surface contamination and bending. Our studies suggest that quasi-2D nanostructures of topological insulators show promise for future electronic and optoelectronic applications.

ABSTRACT: Photonic crystals have become a very common and powerful concept in optics since its introduction in the 1980s by Eli Yablonovitch and Sajeev John. It is in fact a concept borrowed from condensed matter physics. The discussion of photonic bands and bandgaps allows us to manipulate light on an optical chip, along a photonic crystal fiber and even in the quantum optics regime. Now, we are witnessing another round of concept translation again from condensed matter physics to optics about topology. Describing photonic bands by using their topology in the reciprocal space gives us a new tool to understand wave propagation and to design optical components. Topology is also an important aspect in light-matter interaction in the field of metamaterials and 2D materials.

ABSTRACT: Under the Born-Markov approximation, a qubit system, such as a two-level atom, is known to undergo a memoryless decay of quantum coherence or excitation when weakly coupled to a featureless environment. Recently, it has been shown that unavoidable disorder in the environment is responsible for non-Markovian effects and information backflow from the environment into the system owing to Anderson localization. This turns disorder into a resource for enhancing non-Markovianity in the system-environment dynamics, which could be of relevance in cavity quantum electrodynamics. Here we consider the decoherence dynamics of a qubit weakly coupled to a two-dimensional bath with a nontrivial topological phase, such as a two-level atom embedded in a two-dimensional coupled-cavity array with a synthetic gauge field realizing a quantum-Hall bath, and show that Markovianity is protected against moderate disorder owing to the robustness of chiral edge modes in the quantum-Hall bath. Interestingly, switching off the gauge field, i.e., flipping the bath into a topological trivial phase, allows one to re-introduce non-Markovian effects. Such a result indicates that changing the topological phase of a bath by a tunable synthetic gauge field can be harnessed to control non-Markovian effects and quantum information backflow in a qubit-environment system.

ABSTRACT: The valley topological edge states (VTESs) have become a new research hotspot in topological photonics because of its flexibility and diversity. The major challenge for them comes from the dynamical modulation and the weak ability of direction-locked. In this paper, a triangular lattice made of rotatable dielectric rods with three circular holes is designed. Through the rotation of rod, the lifting of the valley points leads to double nontrivial bandgaps and double-band VTESs. The spin-locked excitation of the VTESs, is dependent on whether the nontrivial bandgaps is closed by the VTESs. The reconfigurable VTESs have been achieved with the idea of programmable coding, which provides potential applications in on-chip photon routing.

ABSTRACT: There is a recent surge of interest to the bound states in the continuum (BICs) due to their ability to provide high-quality resonances in open photonic systems. They are usually observed in perturbed systems possessing Fano resonances in their spectra. We argue that, generally speaking, the Fano resonances should not be considered as a proxy for BICs (as it is often done) due to their fundamentally different topological properties. This difference is illustrated with the non-Hermitian layered structure supporting both topologically nontrivial quasi-BIC and topologically trivial Fano resonances. Non-Hermiticity can also be a source of additional topological features of these resonant responses. Moreover, the lasing mode associated with BIC in this structure also possesses nonzero topological charge that can be useful for producing unconventional states of light. This paper contributes to the discussion of BIC physics and raises new questions concerning topological properties of non-Hermitian systems.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics provides a robust platform for the study of nanophotonic devices. The topological rainbow can be used to separate, slow, and trap topological photonic states of different frequencies at different positions. Although numerous reports have investigated the construction of traditional rainbow devices, limited methods have been proposed to realize topological rainbow phenomena and devices. In this Perspective, we provide an overview of the basic concept and mechanisms of rainbow trapping. A topological rainbow is discussed in terms of the implementation of synthetic dimensions. Additionally, recent advances of the topological rainbow are presented for elastic and acoustic waves. We introduce current physical methods of realizing the topological rainbow and discuss potential applications in physics and engineering.

ABSTRACT: Topological polarization selection devices, which can sep-arate topological photonic states of different polarizations into different positions, play a key role in the field of integrated photonics. However, there has been no effective method to realize such devices to date. Here, we have real-ized a topological polarization selection concentrator based on synthetic dimensions. The topological edge states of dou-ble polarization modes are constructed by introducing lattice translation as a synthetic dimension in a completed pho-tonic bandgap photonic crystal with both TE and TM modes. The proposed device can work on multiple frequencies and is robust against disorders. This work provides a new,to the best of our knowledge, scheme to realize topological polarization selection devices, and it will enable practical applications such as topological polarization routers, optical storage, and optical buffers.

ABSTRACT: Topological plasmonics provide insights for the manipulation of light. Analogous to the exotic nature of topological edge states in topological photonics, topological plasmonics combine concepts from topology and plasmonics. By utilizing topological protection, plasmons can be made to propagate without significant scattering or decay, even in the presence of nano- or mesoscale defects or disorders. Herein, we present a study of the design, characterization, and manipulation of topological plasmonic chains of nanodiscs based on the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model made into a ring geometry. The investigation focuses on exploring the unique properties of these resonators and their potential to support topologically protected edge modes within the continuum of rotationally symmetric optical modes of a ring. To observe the topological edge modes in rotationally symmetric chains, we employed a symmetry-breaking excitation technique based on electron beams. It analyzes the influence of parameters, such as dimerization and loop numbers, on the presence of topological modes. Additionally, we explore the manipulation of electron impact positions to control the direction of propagation and selectively excite specific bulk or edge modes. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of topological effects by numerically investigating their design principles and exploring techniques to manipulate topological edge modes. The insights gained from this study have implications for the development of nanoscale plasmonic systems with customized functionalities. These findings potentially impact various areas, including nanophotonics, nanosensing (e.g., biosensors and chemical detection), as well as nanooptical communication components, such as nanowaveguides, resonators, modulators, and quantum information processing.

ABSTRACT: The properties of topological edge states of resonant photonic lattices are reported. The canonical 1D lattice embodies all chief qualities necessary for a complete comprehension of the variety of fundamental physical processes at play. Radiating topological edge states are understood in terms of leaky-mode resonance stimulated by counter-propagating Bloch modes. As a free-space electromagnetic wave illuminates the junction between band-flipped photonic lattices, quasi-leaky resonant light is localized at the interface, which embodies the characteristics of the closed-band state of the composite lattice. Rigorous numerical examples with Ge/ZnSe-based lattices with a finite number of periods and having homogeneous sublayers illustrate the resonance properties of the constituent lattices, the band-closed lattice, and the composite lattice hosting the radiant edge state. The topological interface is seen to radiate effectively near the wavelength where the band closes. With the insight gained from the 1D analysis, a representative 2D lattice is similarly treated. As orthogonal leaky modes are supported by 2D lattices, the interface-bound energy flow picture is more intriguing. Thus, lateral TE and TM modes can be excited to run along the topological interface or normal to it. Versatile power flow, energy density, and radiation characteristics are then available at the 2D topological interface.

ABSTRACT: We have studied diverse vector and hybrid light fields, including those with multiple polarization singularities, and have derived relationships for polarization singularity indices based on the familiar Berry formula, which is normally utilized to find the topological charge of a scalar vortex light field. The fields with pure polar-angle-dependent polarization in the beam cross-section are shown to feature either polarization singularity lines outgoing from the center or a single polarization singularity point at the beam center. The fields with pure radial-variable-dependent polarization are shown to have no polarization singularities and zero polarization index. The vector fields with both polar-angle- and radial-variable-dependent polarization are shown to have multiple polarization singularity points that are scattered across the cross-section. A vector field with higher-order radial polarization and a real parameter was also studied and was shown to feature either several polarization singularity lines outgoing from the center or a central singular point, depending on the parameter value. Notably, at different parameter values, the polarization singularity index of such a field can take half-integer, integer, or zero values.

ABSTRACT: Photonic topological insulators supporting unidirectional topologically protected edge states represent an attractive platform for the realization of disorder- and backscattering-immune transport of edge excitations in both linear and nonlinear regimes. While the properties of the edge states at unclosed interfaces of two bulk media with different topologies are known, the existence of edge states in practical finite-dimensional topological insulators fully immersed in a nontopological environment remains largely unexplored. In this work, using realistic polariton topological insulators built from small-size honeycomb arrays of microcavity pillars as an example, it is shown how topological properties of the system build up upon gradual increase of its dimensionality. To account for the dissipative nature of the polariton condensate forming in the array of microcavity pillars, the impact of losses and resonant pump leading to rich bistability effects in this system is considered. The mechanism is described in accordance with which trivial-phase pump selects and excites specific nonlinear topological edge states circulating along the periphery of the structure in the azimuthal direction, dictated by the direction of the external applied magnetic field. The possibility of utilization of vortex pump with different topological charges for selective excitation of different edge currents is also shown.

ABSTRACT: Leveraging topological properties in the response of electromagnetic systems can greatly enhance their potential. Although the investigation of singularity-based electromagnetics and non-Hermitian electronics has considerably increased in recent years in the context of various scattering anomalies, their topological properties have not been fully assessed. In this work, it is theoretically and experimentally demonstrated that non-Hermitian perturbations around bound states in the continuum can lead to singularities of the scattering matrix, which are topologically nontrivial and comply with charge conservation. The associated scattering matrix poles, zeros, and pole-zero pairs delineate extreme scattering events, including lasing, coherent perfect absorption, and absorber-lasers. The presented framework enables a recipe for generation, annihilation, and addition of these singularities in electric circuits, with potential for extreme scattering engineering across a broad range of the electromagnetic spectrum for sensing, wireless power and information transfer, polarization control, and thermal emission devices.

ABSTRACT: In this work, we report a ubiquitous presence of topological Floquet time crystal (TFTC) in one-dimensional periodically driven systems. The rigidity and realization of spontaneous discrete time-translation symmetry (DTS) breaking in our TFTC model require necessarily coexistence of anomalous topological invariants (0 modes and pi modes), instead of the presence of disorders or many-body localization. We found that in a particular frequency range of the underlying drive, the anomalous Floquet phase coexistence between 0 and pi modes can produce the period doubling (2T, two cycles of the drive) that breaks the DTS spontaneously, leading to the subharmonic response (omega/2, half the drive frequency). The rigid period-2T oscillation is topologically protected against perturbations due to both nontrivially opening of 0 and pi gaps in the quasienergy spectrum, thus, as a result, can be viewed as a specific Rabi oscillation between two Floquet eigenstates with certain quasienergy splitting pi/T. Our modeling of the time-crystalline ground state can be easily realized in experimental platforms such as topological photonics and ultracold fields. Also, our work can bring significant interest to explore topological phase transition in Floquet systems and to bridge the gap between Floquet topological insulators and photonics, and period-doubled time crystals.

ABSTRACT: Topological insulators (TIs) have attracted significant attention in photonics and acoustics due to their unique physical properties and promising applications. Electronics has recently emerged as an exciting arena to study various topological phenomena because of its advantages in building complex topological structures. Here, we explore TIs on an integrated circuit (IC) platform with a standard complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology. Based on the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, we design a fully integrated topological circuit chain using multiple capacitively-coupled inductor-capacitor resonators. We perform comprehensive post-layout simulations on its physical layout to observe and evaluate the salient topological features. Our results demonstrate the existence of the topological edge state and the remarkable robustness of the edge state against various defects. Our work shows the feasibility and promise of studying TIs with IC technology, paving the way for future explorations of large-scale topological electronics on the scalable IC platform.

ABSTRACT: Dirac cones (DCs) are an important band structure in topological insulators (TIs) for realizing topological phase transition, and they provide unique ways to artificially regulate wave transport. Herein, we proposed a simple method to achieve Dirac hierarchy in three-dimensional (3D) acoustic TIs with rich and controllable topological phase transitions. The split of multifold DCs in each bulk Dirac hierarchy induced boundary Dirac hierarchy, including topological surface states and topological hinge states. We successfully realized 3D higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs) that exhibited two-fold boundary Dirac hierarchy with hinge states and achieved energy transport along three independent directions based on hinge-to-hinge channels. The proposed method is not limited to single hinges, and it provides a new design idea for multidimensional sound transport, serving as the basis for controllable acoustic functional devices.

ABSTRACT: Non-Hermitian physics has been a newly emerging research front in many branches of physics, like quantum systems, photonics and ultracold atoms. Considering the energy exchange to the environment, the non-Hermitian system can exhibit many intriguing states that have no Hermitian counterparts. Besides, the topological state of matter is another hot topic to many researchers. Topological insulators can be metallic at the surface while keep isolated in the interior. This intriguing property is robust to backscattering and many external disorders, under the topological protection. After being introduced to the field of condensed matter physics to explain the integer quantum hall effect, topological physics has been extended to classical physics rapidly. By combining the non-Hermiticity and topology, the non-Hermitian topological insulator has its unique properties and gives rise to many novel phenomena that can hardly be realized in purely non-Hermitian or topological systems. Owing to the large macroscopic dimension and flexible fabrication, acoustic systems can be regarded as an ideal platform to study the interaction between the non-Hermiticity and topology. The information of the fields, i.e., energy distribution, phase response and frequency response, can be easily detected in many approaches. Also, the gain effect can be mimicked by flow sound interactions, electric acoustic conversion and thermoacoustic effects in acoustics. In this paper, we mainly focused on three aspects of non-Hermitian topological acoustics. First, we introduce the cases that on-Hermitian modulation is imposed on the topological system. Under this circumstance, the degenerated topological states will be divided into two groups. One is related to the amplified mode, the other one is related to the attenuated mode. Second, we introduce the cases that the topological phases are induced by non-Hermiticity solely. Non-Hermiticity can play the role of coupling that changes the real part of eigen-spectra. Thus, with the appropriate non-Hermitian modulation, the acoustic system can be changed from trivial phases into non-trivial phases, associated with the rich topological states. Finally, we introduce the non-Hermitian skin effect, which is a unique feature of non-Hermitian systems. By constructing non-reciprocal couplings or introducing gain and loss modulations to the on-site potential, the conventional bulk-boundary-correspondence breaks and all the bulk modes will be driven to the boundaries of the system. The band structure obtained from periodical boundary conditions is not consistent with that obtained from open boundary conditions, which finally indicates a point gap in the complex eigen-spectra. In acoustics, we can utilize the technique of signal processing to realize the non-reciprocal coupling in an active way. Also, we can employ the coupled ring structure to decouple the clockwise and counterclockwise modes to construct pseudo-spin degree. By introducing asymmetric non-Hermitian modulation to the linking ring, the reciprocity can be broken effectively for the modes with specific pseudo-spin degree. Throughout this paper, we have discussed the methods that introduce the non-Hermitian modulation during the simulations and calculations, the versatile approaches to demonstrate the characteristics of non-Hermitian topological phases and the experimental skills in fabrications and measurements. We hope this paper can be useful to the readers who are interested in non-Hermitian topological acoustics.

ABSTRACT: "Topological crystalline insulators, topological insulators whose properties are guaranteed by crystalline symmetry, can potentially provide a promising platform for terahertz optoelectronic devices, as their properties can be tuned on demand when layered in heterostructures. We perform the first optical-pump terahertz-probe spectroscopy of topological crystalline insulators, using them to study the dynamics of Pb1-xSnxSe as a function of temperature. At low temperatures, excitation of Dirac fermions leads to an increase in terahertz transmission  from this negative photoconductivity, the intrasubband relaxation rate of 6 ps is extracted. At high temperatures, where only massive Fermions exist, the free-carrier losses induced by the pump reduce the terahertz transmission for the duration of the 27 ps interband lifetime. Both effects are present at temperatures near the topological-to-trivial transition. Our experimental observations provide critical details for potential applications of Pb1-xSnxSe and provide a direct measurement of the topological character of Pb1-xSnxSe heterostructures."

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics has emerged as a route to robust optical circuitry protected against disorder(1,2) and now includes demonstrations such as topologically protected lasing(3-5) and single-photon transport(6). Recently, nonlinear optical topological structures have attracted special theoretical interest(7-11), as they enable tuning of topological properties by a change in the light intensity(7,12) and can break optical reciprocity(13-15) to realize full topological protection. However, so far, non-reciprocal topological states have only been realized using magneto-optical materials and macroscopic set-ups with external magnets(4,16), which is not feasible for nanoscale integration. Here we report the observation of a third-harmonic signal from a topologically non-trivial zigzag array of dielectric nanoparticles and the demonstration of strong enhancement of the nonlinear photon generation at the edge states of the array. The signal enhancement is due to the interaction between the Mie resonances of silicon nanoparticles and the topological localization of the electric field at the edges. The system is also robust against various perturbations and structural defects. Moreover, we show that the interplay between topology, bianisotropy and nonlinearity makes parametric photon generation tunable and non-reciprocal. Our study brings nonlinear topological photonics concepts to the realm of nanoscience.

ABSTRACT: Polaritons in polar biaxial crystals with extreme anisotropy offer apromising route to manipulate nanoscale light-matter interactions. Thedynamic modulation of their dispersion is of great significance for futureintegrated nano-optics but remains challenging. Here, we report tunabletopological transitions in biaxial crystals enabled by interface engineering. Wetheoretically demonstrate such tailored polaritons at the interface ofheterostructures between graphene and alpha-phase molybdenum trioxide (alpha-MoO3). The interlayer coupling can be modulated by both the stack ofgraphene and alpha-MoO3and the magnitude of the Fermi level in grapheneenabling a dynamic topological transition. More interestingly, we found that thewavefront transition occurs at a constant Fermi level when the thickness of alpha-MoO3is tuned. Furthermore, we also experimentallyverify the hybrid polaritons in the graphene/alpha-MoO3heterostructure with different thicknesses of alpha-MoO3. The interfaceengineering offers new insights into optical topological transitions, which may shed new light on programmable polaritonics, energytransfer, and neuromorphic photonics.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics has emerged as a novel approach to engineering the flow of light and provides unprecedented means for developing diverse photonic elements, including robust optical waveguides immune to structural imperfections. However, the development of nanoscale standing-wave cavities in topological photonics is rather slow, despite its importance when building densely integrated photonic integrated circuits. In this Letter, we report a photonic crystal nanocavity based on a topological corner state, supported at a 90-deg-angled rim of a two-dimensional photonic crystal. A combination of the bulk-edge and edge-corner correspondences guarantees the presence of the higher-order topological state in a hierarchical manner. We experimentally observe a corner mode that is tightly localized in space while supporting a high Q factor over 2,000, verifying its promise as a nanocavity. These results cast new light on the way to introduce nanocavities in topological photonics platforms. (C) 2019 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement

ABSTRACT: Topological physics provides a robust framework for strategically controlling wave confinement and propagation dynamics. However, current implementations have been restricted to the limited design parameter space defined by passive topological structures. Active systems provide a more general framework where different fundamental symmetry paradigms, such as those arising from non-Hermiticity and nonlinear interaction, can generate a new landscape for topological physics and its applications. Here, we bridge this gap and present an experimental investigation of an active topological photonic system, demonstrating a topological hybrid silicon microlaser array respecting the charge-conjugation symmetry. The created new symmetry features favour the lasing of a protected zero mode, where robust single-mode laser action in the desired state prevails even with intentionally introduced perturbations. The demonstrated microlaser is hybrid implemented on a silicon-on-insulator substrate, and is thereby readily suitable for integrated silicon photonics with applications in optical communication and computing.

ABSTRACT: Topological constant-intensity (TCI) waves are introduced in the context of non-Hermitian photonics. Unlike other known examples of topological defects, the proposed TCI waves exhibit a counterintuitive behavior because a phase difference occurs across space without any accompanying intensity variations. Such solutions exist only on non-Hermitian systems, because the associated nonzero phase difference is directly related to the real and imaginary parts of the potential. The free space diffraction and the existence of such waves in two spatial dimensions are also discussed in detail. (C) 2022 Optical Society of America

ABSTRACT: Topological phases of matter have been attracting significant attention across diverse fields, from inherently quantum systems to classical photonic and acoustic metamaterials. In photonics, topological phases offer resilience and bring novel opportunities to control light with pseudo-spins. However, topological photonic systems can suffer from limitations, such as breakdown of topological properties due to their symmetry-protected origin and radiative leakage. Here we introduce adiabatic topological photonic interfaces, which help to overcome these issues. We predict and experimentally confirm that topological metasurfaces with slowly varying synthetic gauge fields significantly improve the guiding features of spin-Hall and valley-Hall topological structures commonly used in the design of topological photonic devices. Adiabatic variation in the domain wall profiles leads to the delocalization of topological boundary modes, making them less sensitive to details of the lattice, perceiving the structure as an effectively homogeneous Dirac metasurface. As a result, the modes showcase improved bandgap crossing, longer radiative lifetimes and propagation distances. Smooth topological photonic interfaces lead to less localized boundary modes which improves their guiding characteristics in both spin- and valley Hall metasurfaces. The modes become insensitive to the lattice details, showcasing improved bandgap crossing and longer propagation distances.

ABSTRACT: Three-dimensional topological insulators possess various interesting properties that are promising for various modern applications, including in the recently emerging fields of ultrafast THz photonics and spintronics. Their gapless spin-momentum-locked topological surface states with the presence of chiral spin structure are relevant for the development of light helicity-sensitive THz emitters and detectors. In this paper, we report femtosecond excitation pulse wavelength and helicity-dependent response of Bi2Te3 and Bi2Se3 for an enhanced broadband THz pulse emission from the surface and bulk states. Specifically, the excitation wavelength has been varied in a large range from near UV to near IR, where it was observed that the photoexcitation at shorter wavelengths enhances the THz emission from both the surface and bulk states but more rapidly from the surface states. These results will be highly relevant for developing chirality-sensitive efficient THz emitters and detectors.

ABSTRACT: Topologically protected photonic edge states offer unprecedented robust propagation of photons that are promising for waveguiding, lasing, and quantum information processing. Here, we report on the discovery of a class of hybrid topological photonic crystals that host simultaneously quantum anomalous Hall and valley Hall phases in different photonic band gaps. The underlying hybrid topology manifests itself in the edge channels as the coexistence of the dual-band chiral edge states and unbalanced valley Hall edge states. We experimentally realize the hybrid topological photonic crystal, unveil its unique topological transitions, and verify its unconventional dual-band gap topological edge states using pump-probe techniques. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the dual-band photonic topological edge channels can serve as frequency-multiplexing devices that function as both beam splitters and combiners. Our study unveils hybrid topological insulators as an exotic topological state of photons as well as a promising route toward future applications in topological photonics. Owing to the nonequilibrium nature, photonic topological phenomena can involve multiple band gaps. Here the authors report on the discovery of a class of hybrid topological photonic crystals that host quantum anomalous Hall and valley Hall phases simultaneously.

ABSTRACT: Confinement of electromagnetic fields at the subwavelength scale via metamaterial paradigms is an established method to engineer light-matter interaction in most common material systems, from insulators to semiconductors and from metals to superconductors. In recent years, this approach has been extended to the realm of topological materials, providing a new avenue to access nontrivial features of their electronic band structure. In this review, we survey various topological material classes from a photonics standpoint, including crystal growth and lithographic structuring methods. We discuss how exotic electronic features such as spin-selective Dirac plasmon polaritons in topological insulators or hyperbolic plasmon polaritons in Weyl semimetals may give rise to unconventional magneto-optic, nonlinear, and circular photogalvanic effects in metamaterials across the visible to infrared spectrum. Finally, we dwell on how these effects may be dynamically controlled by applying external perturbations in the form of electric and magnetic fields or ultrafast optical pulses. Through these examples and future perspectives, we argue that topological insulator, semimetal and superconductor metamaterials are unique systems to bridge the missing links between nanophotonic, electronic, and spintronic technologies.

ABSTRACT: Ultrastrong confinement, long lifetime, and gate-tunability of graphene plasmon polaritons (GPPs) motivate wide-ranging efforts to develop GPP-based active nanophotonic platforms. Incorporation of topological phenomena into such platforms will ensure their robustness as well as enrich their capabilities as promising test beds of strong light-matter interactions. A recently reported approach suggests an experimentally viable platform for topological graphene plasmonics by introducing nanopatterned gatesmetagates. We propose a metagate-tuned GPP platform emulating a second-order topological crystalline insulator. The metagate imprints its crystalline symmetry onto graphene by modulating its chemical potential via field-effect gating. Depending on the gate geometry and applied voltage, the resulting two-dimensional crystal supports either one-dimensional chiral edge states or zero-dimensional midgap corner states. The proposed approach to achieving the hierarchy of nontrivial topological invariants at all dimensions lower than the dimension of the host material paves the way to utilizing higher-order topological effects for onchip and ultracompact nanophotonic waveguides and cavities.

ABSTRACT: The zero gap surface states of a 3D-topological insulator host Dirac fermions with spin locked to the momentum. The gap-less Dirac fermions exhibit electronic behaviour different from those predicted in conventional materials. While calculations based on a simple linear dispersion can account for observed experimental patterns, a more accurate description of the physics of these systems and a better agreement between experimental data theoretical results can be obtained by including higher order (k) over right arrow k terms in the Hamiltonian. In this work, in presence of a time reversal symmetry breaking external magnetic field and higher order warping term, alteration to the topologically ordained Berry phase of (2n + 1) pi, momentum relaxation time, and the magneto-conductivity tensors is established. The relation between scattering times and the deviations to topological Berry phase of pi is also emphasized.

ABSTRACT: Broadside radiation from Chern photonic topological insulators (PTIs) is studied in this work. The one-way dispersion of the topological edge mode is located in the fast wave region, making leaky-wave radiation possible. In this communication, design guidelines are presented and validated by full-wave simulations: the Berry curvature and the Chern number of photonic crystals are calculated to design a topological edge mode, then a leaky-wave antenna is proposed where a perturbation is utilized around the source location to eliminate open-stopband behavior and generate broadside radiation with high efficiency. It is demonstrated that leakage of the topological edge mode is capable of both frequency and bias scanning to generate a steerable beam across the broadside direction. Moreover, the mechanism behind the immunity of PTIs to defects is also investigated in detail. Although topological edge waves can bypass PEC-slab defects ideally, the phase change along the defect affects the radiation pattern. The switch between sum-difference beams by tuning the scale of the PEC-slab is direct evidence to verify our analysis. To sum up, the open-stopband behavior is overcome to realize broadside radiation, and the conditional robustness of PTIs in terms of antennas is clarified.

ABSTRACT: Low-dimensional (LD) materials demonstrate intriguing optical properties, which lead to applications in diverse fields, such as photonics, biomedicine and energy. Due to modulation of electronic structure by the reduced structural dimensionality, LD versions of metal, semiconductor and topological insulators (TIs) at the same time bear distinct nonlinear optical (NLO) properties as compared with their bulk counterparts. Their interaction with short pulse laser excitation exhibits a strong nonlinear character manifested by NLO absorption, giving rise to optical limiting or saturated absorption associated with excited state absorption and Pauli blocking in different materials. In particular, the saturable absorption of these emerging LD materials including two-dimensional semiconductors as well as colloidal TI nanoparticles has recently been utilized for Q-switching and mode-locking ultra-short pulse generation across the visible, near infrared and middle infrared wavelength regions. Beside the large operation bandwidth, these ultrafast photonics applications are especially benefit from the high recovery rate as well as the facile processibility of these LD materials. The prominent NLO response of these LD materials have also provided new avenues for the development of novel NLO and photonics devices for all-optical control as well as optical circuits beyond ultrafast lasers.

ABSTRACT: Topological insulators are unique devices supporting unidirectional edge states at their interfaces. Due to topological protection, such edge states persist in the presence of disorder and do not experience backscattering upon interaction with defects. Despite the topological protection and the fact that such states at the opposite edges of an insulator carry opposite currents, a physical mechanism exists allowing topological excitations propagating at opposite edges to be resonantly coupled. Such a mechanism uses weak periodic temporal modulations of the system parameters and does not affect the internal symmetry and topology of the system. This mechanism is illustrated in truncated honeycomb arrays of microcavity pillars, where topological insulation is possible for polaritons under the combined action of spin-orbit coupling and Zeeman splitting in the external magnetic field. The temporal modulation of the potential leads to a periodic switching between topological states with the same Bloch momentum, but located at the opposite edges. The switching rate is found to increase for narrower ribbon structures and for larger modulation depth, though it is changing nonmonotonically with the Bloch momentum of the input edge state. These results provide a promising realization of a coupling device based on topologically protected states.

ABSTRACT: The photonics topological state plays an important role in recent optical physics and has led to devices with robust properties. However, the design of optical structures with the target topological states is a challenge for current research. Here, we propose an approach to achieve this goal by exploiting machine learning technologies. In our work, we focus on Zak phases, which are the topological properties of one-dimensional photonics crystals. After learning the principle between the geometrical parameters and the Zak phases, the neural network can obtain the appropriate structures of photonics crystals by applying the objective Zak phase properties. Our work would give more insights into the application of machine learning on the inverse design of the complex material properties and could be extended to other fields, i.e., advanced phononics devices.

ABSTRACT: We report on the electrodynamics of MnBi2Te4 thin films, an intrinsic magnetic topological material. We study its optical conductivity from terahertz (THz) to ultraviolet (UV) frequencies as a function of the film thickness, highlighting the presence of surface topological states superimposed on the bulk electrodynamics response. For the thinnest film, where the charge transport is dominated by Dirac surface states, we investigate the effect of the phase transition from the high-temperature topological protected state to the low-temperature magnetic (time-reversal broken) state by measuring the optical conductivity across the Neel temperature. At low temperatures, the breaking of the time reversal symmetry affects the optical conductivity, indicating that a magnetic-induced gap opens below T-N.

ABSTRACT: In the last years there have been multiple proposals in nanophotonics to mimic topological condensed matter systems. Howe v e r , nanoparticles have degrees of freedom that atoms lack of, like dimensions or shape, which can be exploited to explore topology beyond electronics. Elongated nanoparticles can act like projectors of the electric field in the direction of the major axis. Then, by orienting them in an array the coupling between them can be tuned, allowing to open a gap in an otherwise gapless system. As a proof of the potential of the use of orientation of nanoparticles for topology, we study 1D chains of prolate spheroidal silver nanoparticles. We show that in these arrays spatial modulation of the polarization allows to open gaps, engineer hidden crysta l l i n e symmetries and to switch on/off or left/right edge states depending on the polarization of the incident electric field. This opens a path toward exploiting features of nanoparticles for topology to go beyond analogues of condensed matter systems.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics has attracted widespread research attention in the past decade due to its fundamental interest and unique manner in controlling light propagation for advanced applications. Paradigmatic approaches have been proposed to achieve topological phases including topological insulators in a variety of photonic systems. In particular, photonic lattices composed of evanescently coupled waveguide arrays have been employed conveniently to explore and investigate topological physics. In this article, we review our recent work on the demonstration of topological phenomena in reconfigurable photonic lattices established by site-to-site cw-laser-writing or multiple-beam optical induction in photorefractive nonlinear crystals. We focus on the study of topological states realized in the celebrated one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattices, including nonlinear topological edge states and gap solitons, nonlinearity-induced coupling to topological edge states, and nonlinear control of non-Hermitian topological states. In the two-dimensional case, we discuss two typical examples: universal mapping of momentum-space topological singularities through Dirac-like photonic lattices and realization of real-space nontrivial loop states in flatband photonic lattices. Our work illustrates how photorefractive materials can be employed conveniently to build up various synthetic photonic microstructures for topological studies, which may prove relevant and inspiring for the exploration of fundamental phenomena in topological systems beyond photonics.

ABSTRACT: A novel method is developed in this paper to characterize the band diagram and modal fields of gyromagnetic photonic crystals that support topolgoical one-way edge states. We exploy an integral equation based method that utilizes the broadband Green's function as the kernel. The broadband Green's function is a hybrid representation of the periodic lattice Green's function that includes an imaginary wavenumber component represented in exponentially decaying spatial series and a reminder in fast converging Floquet plane wave expansions. Special boundary conditions govern the fields across the interface of the gyromagnetic scatterers, leading to surface integral equations (SIEs) that involve three components including the pilot field, its normal derivative and its tangential derivative. To reduce the independent number of unknowns, roof-top basis functions and the Garlerkin's method are used to discretize the SIEs into matrix equations. The broadband Green's function allows converting the discretized SIEs into a linear eigenvalue problem of a small size. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the linear eigenvalue problem are directly related to the band solutions and modal fields of the photonic crystal. The proposed approach is an effective method to characterize wave interactions with periodic scatterers using integral equations. The solutions of the presented approach are compared against Comsol simulations for various cases to show its accuracy and efficiency.

ABSTRACT: Lasers are the pillars of modern photonics and sensing. Recent advances in microlasers have demonstrated its extraordinary lasing characteristics suitable for biosensing. However, most lasers utilized lasing spectrum as a detection signal, which can hardly detect or characterize nanoscale structural changes in microcavity. Here the concept of amplified structured light-molecule interactions is introduced to monitor tiny bio-structural changes in a microcavity. Biomimetic liquid crystal droplets with self-assembled lipid monolayers are sandwiched in a Fabry-Perot cavity, where subtle protein-lipid membrane interactions trigger the topological transformation of output vector beams. By exploiting Amyloid beta (A beta)-lipid membrane interactions as a proof-of-concept, it is demonstrated that vector laser beams can be viewed as a topology of complex laser modes and polarization states. The concept of topological-encoded laser barcodes is therefore developed to reveal dynamic changes of laser modes and A beta-lipid interactions with different A beta assembly structures. The findings demonstrate that the topology of vector beams represents significant features of intracavity nano-structural dynamics resulted from structured light-molecule interactions.

ABSTRACT: The rapid development of additive manufacturing has fueled a revolution in various research fields and industrial applications. Among the myriad of advanced 3D printing techniques, two-photon polymerization lithography (TPL) uniquely offers a significant advantage in nanoscale print resolution, and has been widely employed in diverse fields, for example, life sciences, materials sciences, mechanics, and microfluidics. More recently, by virtue of the optical transparency of most of the resins used, TPL is finding new applications in optics and photonics, with nanometer to millimeter feature dimensions. It enables the minimization of optical elements and systems, and exploration of light-matter interactions with new degrees of freedom, never possible before. To review the recent progress in the TPL related optical research, it starts with the fundamentals of TPL and material formulation, then discusses novel fabrication methods, and a wide range of optical applications. These applications notably include diffractive, topological, quantum, and color optics. With a panoramic view of the development, it is concluded with insights and perspectives of the future development of TPL and related potential optical applications.

ABSTRACT: Topological structures currently are of special interest in the integration of singular optics and topological photonics. In this article, the topological flowers and spider webs, which got less attention comparing to the lemon-, star- structures of the same category, are investigated in 3D vector fields. We show that by strongly focusing higher-order singular beams, both the spin density (SD) vectors and the polarization states of the transverse fields on the focal plane exhibit flowers and spider webs structures in topology with 2 vertical bar m - 1 vertical bar folds/sectors (in is the beam order), and the topological structures of the SD vectors are demonstrated to have a 90 degrees/vertical bar m -1 vertical bar rotation. On the other hand, the topological theory also needs to be developed according to the rapid growth of topological photonics. Here, by defining a 'relative topological charge', we have observed and analyzed the topological reactions of the loops (composed of SD singularities) rather than the 'point-type' singularities in conventional reactions. More specially, the 'radial index' and 'azimuthal index' are proposed to characterize the topological features of the flowers and spider webs, and have been verified that the 'radial index' is peculiar to 3D vector fields and proportional to 1/vertical bar m - 1 vertical bar in general. Our work provides a way to describe the topological behaviors of groups of singularities and supplies new parameters fbr measuring the topological patterns in 3D vector fields, which will rich the topological theory and may have applications in topological photonics.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonic nanocavities are considered to possess outstanding optical performance, and provide new platforms for realizing strong interaction between light and matter, due to their robustness to impurities and defects. Here hybrid plasmonic topological photonic nanocavities are proposed, by embedding various plasmon nanoantennas such as gold nanospheres, cylinders, and rectangles in a topological photonic crystal corner-state nanocavity. The maximum quality factor Q and minimum effective mode volume Veff of these hybrid nanocavities can reach the order of 104 and 10-4 (),/n)3 respectively, and the high figures of merit Q/Veff for all of these hybrid nanocavites are stable and on the order of 105 (),/n)-3. The relative positions of the plasmon nanoantennas will influence the coupling strength between the plasmon structures and the topological nanocavity. The hybrid nanocavity with gold nanospheres possesses much higher Q, but relatively large Veff. The presence of a gold rectangular structure can confine more electromagnetic energy within a smaller space, since its Veff is smallest, although Q is lowest among these structures. This work provides an outstanding platform for cavity quantum electrodynamics and has a wide range of applications in topological quantum light sources, such as single-photon sources and nanolasers.

ABSTRACT: On-chip topological nanophotonic filtering and routing devices are important components of integrated nanophotonic chip. The device filters topological photonic states with multiple frequencies and routes them into different output ports, respectively. However, there is no effective method to implement such devices to date. Here, an on-chip topological five-channel filtering and routing device is realized for the first time. Topological edge states are constructed based on synthetic dimension, which can use dielectric materials to construct topological photonic states without external magnetic field. This method has advantages including simple structure, easy integration, and high signal-to-noise ratio. The implementation of on-chip topological multichannel filtering and routing device is of great significance to the development of topological nanophotonic devices.

ABSTRACT: Strong light-matter interaction enriches topological photonics by dressing light with matter, which provides the possibility to realize active nonlinear topological devices with immunity to defects. Topological exciton polaritons-half-light, half-matter quasiparticles with giant optical nonlinearity-represent a unique platform for active topological photonics. Previous demonstrations of exciton polariton topological insulators demand cryogenic temperatures, and their topological properties are usually fixed. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a room temperature exciton polariton topological insulator in a perovskite zigzag lattice. Polarization serves as a degree of freedom to switch between distinct topological phases, and the topologically nontrivial polariton edge states persist in the presence of onsite energy perturbations, showing strong immunity to disorder. We further demonstrate exciton polariton condensation into the topological edge states under optical pumping. These results provide an ideal platform for realizing active topological polaritonic devices working at ambient conditions, which can find important applications in topological lasers, optical modulation, and switching.

ABSTRACT: Topological insulators have unconventional gapless edge states where disorder-induced back-scattering is suppressed. In photonics, such edge states lead to unidirectional waveguides which are useful for integrated photonic circuitry. Cavity modes, another type of fundamental component in photonic chips, however, are not protected by band topology because of their lower dimensions. Here we demonstrate that concurrent wavevector space and real-space topology, dubbed as dual-topology, can lead to light-trapping in lower dimensions. The resultant photonic-bound state emerges as a Jackiw-Rebbi soliton mode localized on a dislocation in a two-dimensional photonic crystal, as proposed theoretically and discovered experimentally. Such a strongly confined cavity mode is found to be robust against perturbations. Our study unveils a mechanism for topological light-trapping in lower dimensions, which is invaluable for fundamental physics and various applications in photonics.

ABSTRACT: Topological edge states exist at the interfaces between two topologically distinct materials. The presence and number of such modes are deterministically predicted from the bulk band topologies, known as the bulk-edge correspondence. This principle is highly useful for predictably controlling optical modes in resonators made of photonic crystals (PhCs), leading to the recent demonstrations of microscale topological lasers. Meanwhile, zero-dimensional topological trapped states in the nanoscale remained unexplored, despite its importance for enhancing light-matter interactions and for wide applications including single-mode nanolasers. Here, we report a topological PhC nanocavity with a near-diffraction-limited mode volume and its application to single-mode lasing. The topological origin of the nanocavity, formed at the interface between two topologically distinct PhCs, guarantees the existence of only one mode within its photonic bandgap. The observed lasing accompanies a high spontaneous emission coupling factor stemming from the nanoscale confinement. These results encompass a way to greatly downscale topological photonics.

ABSTRACT: Optical computing holds significant promise of information processing with ultrahigh speed and low power consumption. Recent developments in nanophotonic structures have generated renewed interests due to the prospects of performing analog optical computing with compact devices. As one prominent example, spatial differentiation has been demonstrated with nanophotonic structures and directly applied for edge detection in image processing. However, broadband isotropic two-dimensional differentiation, which is required in most imaging processing applications, has not been experimentally demonstrated yet. Here, we establish a connection between two-dimensional optical spatial differentiation and a nontrivial topological charge in the optical transfer function. Based on this connection, we experimentally demonstrate an isotropic two-dimensional differentiation with a broad spectral bandwidth, by using the simplest photonic device, i.e. a single unpatterned interface. Our work indicates that exploiting concepts from topological photonics can lead to new opportunities in optical computing. Spatial differentiation is a form of optical computation which has applications in image processing. Here, the authors exploit nontrivial topological charges in the transfer function to realise broadband isotropic two-dimensional differentiation.

ABSTRACT: We study the localization of plasmonic modes on topological dislocations obtained by an abrupt change in the geometry of unit cells in a plasmonic metasurface comprised of a nanoscale array of rectangular apertures. We experimentally demonstrate mode localization in line defects and point singularities in the topology. These results are confirmed by numerical simulations of the near field distributions along the topology boundaries. We present structures with line dislocations supporting dark and bright modes. Moreover, we show that in structures with point dislocations the localization strength can be further manipulated by modifying the topological order of the structure.

ABSTRACT: Drive engineering in optical systems can be used to stabilize new nonlinear phases in topological systems. Dissipatively stabilized gap solitons in a polariton lattice establish drive engineering as a resource for nonlinear topological photonics. Nonlinear topological photonics is an emerging field that aims to extend the fascinating properties of topological states to a regime where interactions between the system constituents cannot be neglected. Interactions can trigger topological phase transitions, induce symmetry protection and robustness properties for the many-body system. Here, we report the nonlinear response of a polariton lattice that implements a driven-dissipative version of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. We first demonstrate the formation of topological gap solitons bifurcating from a linear topological edge state. We then focus on the formation of gap solitons in the bulk of the lattice and show that they exhibit robust nonlinear properties against defects, owing to the underlying sublattice symmetry. Leveraging the driven-dissipative nature of the system, we discover a class of bulk gap solitons with high sublattice polarization. We show that these solitons provide an all-optical way to create a non-trivial interface for Bogoliubov excitations. Our results show that coherent driving can be exploited to stabilize new nonlinear phases and establish dissipatively stabilized solitons as a powerful resource for topological photonics.

ABSTRACT: We demonstrate a non-Hermitian topological effect that is characterized by having complex eigenvalues only in the edge states of a topological material, despite the fact that the material is completely uniform. Such an effect can be constructed in any topological structure formed by two gapped subsystems, e.g., a quantum spin-Hall system, with a suitable non-Hermitian coupling between the spins. The resulting complex-eigenvalued edge state is robust against defects due to the topological protection. In photonics, such an effect can be used for the implementation of topological lasers, in which a uniform pumping provides gain only in the edge lasing state. Furthermore, such a topological lasing model is reciprocal and is thus compatible with standard photonic platforms.

ABSTRACT: Chaotic dynamics in microcavity have promoted massive discoveries and applications ranging from decoherence suppression to broadband optical devices. However, a chaotic light source on the chip is more likely to suffer from the ambient randomness and perturbations than its bulk counterparts, vanishing chaotic dynamics. To-pological protection provides a robust framework for manipulating the periodic wave dynamics, whereas the symmetric layout in topological protection poses a direct challenge to leveraging this notion in chaotic dynamics. Here, we discover that benefiting from an engineered exceptional point, the non-Hermitian-enhanced topological protection yields zero modes and switches the chaotic dynamics. As a result, this new effect significantly extends the topologically protected chaotic dynamics to a more general trivial phase beyond the constraint of the to-pological invariant. More importantly, the zero modes merit robust chaotic dynamics prevail with intentionally introduced perturbations. Moreover, we find that an extended photonics lattice composed of an increased number of microcavities not only offers a more robust topological protection but also can delay the chaos generation, providing a new degree of freedom to harness the chaos generation. This study presents a promising approach for robust on-chip chaotic light sources and advances various explorations on multibody non-Hermitian physics.

ABSTRACT: In this article we report the magneto-optical (MO) and electro-optical (EO) modulation, in the terahertz regime, of the photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE) of reflected light from the surface of the topological silicene-substrate quantum systems subjected to external electric and magnetic fields. The prominent feature of these 2D materials is the tunable band gap that can be controlled by an external electric field or by irradiating circular polarized light beam. We demonstrate that the in-plane and transverse spatial spin dependent shifts are quantized due to the Landau level (LL) quantization of the MO conductivities. By controlling the staggered electric potential, we can drive the system through several topological quantum phase transitions. The magnitude of the giant PSHE in these materials is several times larger than the incident Gaussian beam wavelength. Furthermore, the PSHE shifts are extremely sensitive to the spin and valley indices of the Dirac fermions in these materials promising potential in the design of surface sensors, spin-dependent beam splitters, precision meteorology and quantum information processing.

ABSTRACT: The Fraunhofer diffraction pattern of a vortex beam by an annular triangle aperture is analyzed theoretically and experimentally. It is found that the pattern of the far-field diffraction intensity distribution exhibits a triangular lattice array, which becomes much clearer with the increase of the ratio of the inner to the outer side of the annular triangle aperture. The number of spot points of any external side of the triangular lattice array minus one is just equal to the topological charge value of the measured optical vortex. For the vortex beam with negative topological charge, the triangular diffraction pattern after the annular triangle aperture will be rotated by 1800 in relation to the case of the positive topological charge. Based on the above properties, we propose a simple and feasible method to determine the magnitude and sign of the topological charge of an optical vortex beam. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: On-chip optical communications are in increasingly demand for low-loss, small-footprint and power-efficient waveguiding solutions in the telecom band. However, most integrated optical circuits suffer from high propagation loss and low integration degree. Through manipulating the valley-dependent topological phase of light, we have experimentally demonstrated both robust optical transport and electrical modulation of lightwaves at telecom wavelengths in the valley photonic crystals. With the adoption of valley kink states, the 25 Gbit/s optical signal at 1550 nm is successfully transmitted through a highly twisted interface. Furthermore, an extreme high data rate of 100 Gbit/s is demonstrated with such topological waveguide by wavelength division multiplexing. The electrical tunability of the topological modulators based on thermo-optic effect is also verified, opening a novel route towards active valley kink photonic devices. Our study shows a great possibility of making use of the topological protection in building up high-speed datalinks on a chip.

ABSTRACT: Optical microcavities supporting exciton-polariton quasi-particles offer one of the most powerful platforms for the investigation of the rapidly developing area of topological photonics in general, and of photonic topological insulators in particular. Energy bands of the microcavity polariton graphene are readily controlled by a magnetic field and influenced by the spin-orbit (SO) coupling effects, a combination leading to the formation of linear unidirectional edge states in polariton topological insulators as very recently predicted. In this work we depart from the linear limit of non-interacting polaritons and predict instabilities of the nonlinear topological edge states resulting in the formation of the localized topological quasi-solitons, which are exceptionally robust and immune to backscattering wave packets propagating along the graphene lattice edge. Our results provide a background for experimental studies of nonlinear polariton topological insulators and can influence other subareas of photonics and condensed matter physics, where nonlinearities and SO effects are often important and utilized for applications.

ABSTRACT: The interplay of spin angular momentum and thermal radiation is a frontier area of interest to nanophotonics as well as topological physics. Here, we show that a thick planar slab of a nonreciprocal material, despite being at thermal equilibrium with its environment, can exhibit nonzero photon spin angular momentum and nonzero radiative heat flux in its vicinity. We identify them as the persistent thermal photon spin and the persistent planar heat current respectively. With a practical example system, we reveal that the fundamental origin of these phenomena is connected to the spin momentum locking of thermally excited evanescent waves. We also discover spin magnetic moment of surface polaritons that further clarifies these features. We then propose an imaging experiment based on Brownian motion that allows one to witness these surprising features by directly looking at them using a lab microscope. We further demonstrate the universal behavior of these near-field thermal radiation phenomena through a comprehensive analysis of gyroelectric, gyromagnetic and magneto-electric nonreciprocal materials. Together, these results expose a surprisingly little explored research area of thermal spin photonics with prospects for new avenues related to non-Hermitian topological photonics and radiative heat transport.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics in strongly coupled light-matter systems offer the possibility for fabricating tunable optical devices that are robust against disorder and defects. Topological polaritons, i.e., hybrid exciton-photon quasiparticles, have been proposed to demonstrate scatter-free chiral propagation, but their experimental realization to date has been at deep cryogenic temperatures and under strong magnetic fields. We demonstrate helical topological polaritons up to 200 kelvin without external magnetic field in monolayer WS2 excitons coupled to a nontrivial photonic crystal protected by pseudo time-reversal symmetry. The helical nature of the topological polaritons, where polaritons with opposite helicities are transported to opposite directions, is verified. Topological helical polaritons provide a platform for developing robust and tunable polaritonic spintronic devices for classical and quantum information-processing applications.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics aims to utilize topological photonic bands and corresponding edge modes to implement robust light manipulation, which can be readily achieved in the linear regime of light-matter interaction. Importantly, unlike solid-state physics, the common test bed for new ideas in topological physics, topological photonics provides an ideal platform to study wave mixing and other nonlinear interactions. These are well-known topics in classical nonlinear optics but largely unexplored in the context of topological photonics. Here, we investigate nonlinear interactions of one-way edge modes in frequency mixing processes in topological photonic crystals. We present a detailed analysis of the band topology of two-dimensional photonic crystals with hexagonal symmetry and demonstrate that nonlinear optical processes, such as second- and third-harmonic generation, can be conveniently implemented via one-way edge modes in this setup. Moreover, we demonstrate that more exotic phenomena, such as slow-light enhancement of nonlinear interactions and harmonic generation upon interaction of backward-propagating (left-handed) edge modes, can also be realized. Our work opens up new avenues towards topology-protected frequency mixing processes in photonics.

ABSTRACT: A great deal of attention has been paid to the topological phases engineered by photonics over the past few years. Here, we propose a topological quantum phase transition to a quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) phase induced by off-resonant circularly polarized light in a two-dimensional system that is initially in a quantum spin Hall phase or a trivial insulator phase. This provides an alternative method to realize the QAH effect, other than magnetic doping. The circularly polarized light effectively creates a Zeeman exchange field and a renormalized Dirac mass, which are tunable by varying the intensity of the light and drive the quantum phase transition. Both the transverse and longitudinal Hall conductivities are studied, and the former is consistent with the topological phase transition when the Fermi level lies in the band gap. A highly controllable spin-polarized longitudinal electrical current can be generated when the Fermi level is in the conduction band, which may be useful for designing topological spintronics.

ABSTRACT: We theoretically study a topological nanospaser, which consists of a silver nanospheroid and MoS2 monolayer flake of a circular shape. The metal nanospheroid acts as a plasmonic nanoresonator that supports two rotating modes, which are coupled to the corresponding valleys of MoS2. We apply external circularly polarized light that selectively pumps only one of the valleys of MoS2. The generated spaser dynamics strongly depends on the size (radius) of the MoS2 nanoflake. For a small radius, the system has only one spasing regime when only the chirally matched plasmon mode is generated, while at a larger size of MoS2, depending on the pump intensity, there are two regimes. In one regime, only the chirally matched plasmon mode is generated, while in the other regime both chirally matched and chirally mismatched modes exist. Different regimes of spaser operation also have opposite handedness of the far-field radiated spaser system. Such a topological nanospaser has potential applications in different areas of infrared spectroscopy, sensing, probing, and biomedical treatment.

ABSTRACT: The feasibility of realizing a photonic Floquet topological insulator (PFTI) in an atomic ensemble is demonstrated. The interference of three coupling fields will split energy levels periodically, to form a periodic refractive index structure with honeycomb profile that can be adjusted by different frequency detunings and intensities of the coupling fields. This in turn will affect the appearance of Dirac cones in momentum space. When the honeycomb lattice sites are helically ordered along the propagation direction, gaps open at Dirac points, and one obtains a PFTI in an atomic vapor. An obliquely incident beam will be able to move along the zigzag edge of the lattice without scattering energy into the PFTI, due to the confinement of edge states. The appearance of Dirac cones and the formation of a photonic Floquet topological insulator can be shut down by the third-order nonlinear susceptibility and opened up by the fifth-order one.

ABSTRACT: Some topological boundary states are symmetry protected. Experiments with photonic lattices now show that the protection via sub-symmetry is enough to ensure topological modes, even if the full symmetry and topological invariant are destroyed. A hallmark of symmetry-protected topological phases are topological boundary states, which are immune to perturbations that respect the protecting symmetry. It is commonly believed that any perturbation that destroys such a topological phase simultaneously destroys the boundary states. However, by introducing and exploring a weaker sub-symmetry requirement on perturbations, we find that the nature of boundary state protection is in fact more complex. Here we demonstrate that the boundary states are protected by only the sub-symmetry, using Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and breathing kagome lattice models, even though the overall topological invariant and the associated topological phase can be destroyed by sub-symmetry-preserving perturbations. By precisely controlling symmetry breaking in photonic lattices, we experimentally demonstrate such sub-symmetry protection of topological states. Furthermore, we introduce a long-range hopping symmetry in breathing kagome lattices, which resolves a debate on the higher-order topological nature of their corner states. Our results apply beyond photonics and could be used to explore the properties of symmetry-protected topological phases in the absence of full symmetry in different physical contexts.

ABSTRACT: The appearance of topologically protected spin-momentum locked surface states in topological insulators gives rise to robust room temperature spin currents making them ideal candidates for the realization of spintronic devices. New methods are needed to access and manipulate such currents with timescales that are compatible with modern electronics. Here we reveal that an optically induced long-lived (similar to 10 ns), spin-polarized surface state excitation in topological insulators can be easily tuned in both magnitude and duration. Time-resolved angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, together with a quantitative model, reveals the ideal conditions for a surface photovoltage in two different topological insulators. Our model predicts that the reported effects are an intrinsic property of topological insulators, as long as the chemical potential falls within the band gap. This work demonstrates that persistent excited topological surface states are photon-accessible and easily tuned in both magnitude and duration, merging photonics- and spintronics-based devices in the same material.

ABSTRACT: "Both the collective (plasmon) and the single particle (Drude) excitations of an electron gas can be controlled and modified by an external magnetic field B. At finite B, plasmon gives rise to a magnetoplasmon mode and the Drude term to a cyclotron resonance. These magnetic effects are expected to be extremely strong for Dirac electrons with a linear energy-momentum dispersion, like those present in graphene and topological insulators (TIs). Here, we investigate both the plasmon and the Drude response versus B in Bi2Se3 topological insulator. At low B, the cyclotron resonance is still well separated in energy from the magnetoplasmon mode  meanwhile, both excitations asymptotically converge at the same energy for increasing B, consistently with a dynamical mass for Dirac carriers of m(D)* = 0.18 +/- 0.01 m, In TIs, one then achieves an excellent magnetic control of plasmonic excitations and this could open the way toward plasmon controlled terahertz magneto-optics."

ABSTRACT: Recently introduced field of topological photonics aims to explore the concepts of topological insulators for novel phenomena in optics. Here polymeric chains of subwavelength silicon nanodisks are studied and it is demonstrated that these chains can support two types of topological edge modes based on magnetic and electric Mie resonances, and their topological properties are fully dictated by the spatial arrangement of the nanoparticles in the chain. It is observed experimentally and described how theoretically topological phase transitions at the nanoscale define a change from trivial to nontrivial topological states when the edge mode is excited.

ABSTRACT: Generally speaking, a one-dimensional system requires chiral or particle-hole symmetry to be topologically nontrivial. In this Letter, we show that topological behavior can also be observed in a quasi-one-dimensional photonic system without the aforementioned symmetries. The results indicate that the quantized Zak phase is achieved in such a system even though the chiral and particle-hole symmetries are still absent. Further study shows that the system can support a topologically protected asymmetric near-zero mode on the right edge. Our work enriches the concepts of design of topological photonics and may have important applications in future quantum computations. (C) 2019 Optical Society of America

ABSTRACT: The study of topological photonics has gained significant attention due to its potential application for robust and efficient light manipulation. In this work, we theoretically investigate a two-dimensional photonics crystal that exhibits a topological edge state (TES) and a topological corner state (TCS). Furthermore, we also achieve a coupling between a topological corner state and a trivial cavity (TC), resulting in a phenomenon similar to the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) effect. To verify the stability of the EIT-like effect, disorders around TES and TCS are introduced, and the theoretical results show that this structure is immune to the disorders. The achievement of the coupling between topological states can have potential applications in the areas of waveguiding, sensing, and logic gates. It is hoped that this work will contribute to the ongoing efforts in the exploration and utilization of topological photonics.

ABSTRACT: We theoretically show that multiport photonic lattices emulating driven quantum harmonic oscillators give rise to Aharonov-Anandan geometric phase, which is proportional to the associated dynamic phase irrespective of the initial state. Consequently, the non-adiabatic geometric phase can be directly measured without the need of complex setups to remove the dynamic phase. Further, we propose the observation of such geometric phases in multiport photonic lattices via integrated interferometry. Our work provides insights into the potential development of integrated photonic platforms for modulation-based topological photonics.

ABSTRACT: The discovery of the topological phase of matter has largely influenced solid state physics, photonics and acoustics research in recent years, offering not only deep physical insights into a new generation of materials and light -matter interactions, but also new engineering tools to tailor signal transport with electrons, light and sound, providing unique features in terms of robustness to defects and disorder. In recent years, we have explored opportunities to enable topologically non -trivial propagation in periodic lattices of resonators based on mechanical motion, spatio-temporal modulation and nonlinearities in the realm of optics and photonics, electromagnetics, acoustics and mechanics. Here we review our recent theoretical and experimental progress in inducing topological transitions in nonlinear arrays of resonators, and triggering the topological nature of their band properties. These transitions are associated with unusual propagation properties, including the insurgence of nonlinear solitons guided by moving domain walls, edge modes, and broadband non -reciprocal responses. The emergence of these novel topological states opens the possibility of designing novel electronic, electromagnetic, acoustic and mechanical devices with new functionalities and responses highly tolerant to imperfections in fabrication and disorder, as well as to unwanted parasitic effects.

ABSTRACT: Designing metamaterials with the required band structure, topology and chirality using nano-fabrication technology revolutionise modern science. The approach of this work to the metamaterial theme is, however, different. We report that a periodic sequence, i.e., metacrystal, of the dissipative optical solitons rotating in a ring microresonator acts as an effective metamaterial in the radio to terahertz frequency range. The metacrystal unit cell consists of the bound pair of solitons, where the inter-soliton distance is used as a control parameter. We investigate the soliton metacrystal band structure and topological properties. The latter is confirmed by the pi steps experienced by the crystal phonons' geometrical (Zak) phase. Furthermore, we found the phononic edge states in the metacrystals with defects made by removing several solitons. Optical frequency combs corresponding to the soliton metacrystals hide the spectral butterfly pattern serving as a signature of the spatio-temporal chirality and bearing a resemblance to the natural occurrences of chirality. Topological photonics and time crystals push frontiers of modern physics and promise a host of applications. Here, we report the bandgap structure and topological properties of the soliton trains in Kerr microresonators.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics provides exceptional opportunities to control electromagnetic waves with a great potential for applications. Most of the proposed photonic systems support topological edge states with fixed parameters, thus hindering their practical applications. The study of nonlinear and tunable effects in topological systems enlarges applications of topological phenomena. Here, we propose an approach for the manipulation of photonic topological edge states based on temperature tuning. We design and demonstrate experimentally topological zigzag arrays composed of high-index resonators. The resonators are fabricated from ferroelectrics that brings an opportunity to dynamically change their permittivity by heating. We study the emergence of topological edge states in zigzag arrays of ferroelectric particles supporting the Mie resonances and demonstrate the topological transition induced by heating individual resonators in the array.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics provides a new platform to control and manipulate the flow of light in photonic devices that exhibit topological phase transitions. One way to introduce such transition of geometric phases in photonic waveguides is to modulate the structure of the photonic crystals, array waveguides, or the metamaterials in such a way that it eventually changes the bulk topology. Such topological waveguides localize the light at the boundary of the two distinct bulk systems with different topological invariant. Based on this fundamental physics, we demonstrate a robust and controlled propagation of light in a class of specialty optical fiber which exhibits the topological phase transition between a nontrivial one-dimensional (1D) periodic cylinder and its topologically trivial counterpart. The key idea is to explore the possibility of topological phase transition of 1D photonic bands over the momentum space by tuning the unit-cell dimension and its individual thicknesses. We have systematically computed the trivial and the nontrivial topological invariants, the Zak phase, of designed cylindrical 1D lattices with inversion symmetry over the first Brillouin zone. To establish the presence and the robustness of the localized edge mode, we have studied the reflectance of the geometry in the presence of disorder. Also, the simulated field profile and the back-reflectionless propagation of the edge mode through the fiber have been shown. Besides conventional fibers, such topological optical fibers are definitely a waveguide geometry for robust delivery of light and thus would be very significant to open up a new paradigm in guided wave photonics.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics offers enhanced control over electromagnetic fields by providing a platform for robust trapping and guiding of topological states of light. By combining the strong coupling between topological photons with phonons in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), we demonstrate a platform to control and guide hybrid states of light and lattice vibrations. The observed topological edge states of phonon-polaritons are found to carry nonzero angular momentum locked to their propagation direction, which enables their robust transport. Thus, these topological quasiparticles enable the funneling of infrared phonons mediated by helical infrared photons along arbitrary pathways and across sharp bends, thereby offering opportunities for applications ranging from Raman and vibrational spectroscopy with structured phonon-polaritons to directional heat dissipation.

ABSTRACT: We introduce topological vector edge solitons in a Floquet insulator, consisting of two honeycomb arrays of helical waveguides with opposite directions of rotation in a focusing nonlinear optical medium. Zigzag edges of two arrays placed in contact create a zigzag-zigzag interface between two structures with different topology. A characteristic feature of such a photonic insulator is that, in the linear limit, it simultaneously supports two topologically protected chiral edge states at the interface between the two arrays. In the presence of nonlinearity, either bright or dark scalar Floquet edge soliton can bifurcate from a linear topological edge state. Such solitons are unidirectional and are localized in both directions, along the interface due to nonlinear self-action, and across the interface as being an edge state. The presence of two edge states with equal averaged group velocities enables the existence of stable topological vector edge solitons. In our case, these are nonlinearly coupled bright and dark solitons bifurcating from different branches of the topological Floquet edge states. Here we put forward a new mathematical description of scalar and vector small-amplitude Floquet envelope solitons in the above-mentioned continuous system. Importantly for the design of future photonic devices based on Floquet edge solitons, we find that the latter can be described by nonlinear Schrodinger equations for the mode envelopes obtained by averaging over one rotation period in the evolution coordinate.

ABSTRACT: The synergy between topology and non-Hermiticity in photonics holds immense potential for next-generation optical devices that are robust against defects. However, most demonstrations of non-Hermitian and topological photonics have been limited to super-wavelength scales due to increased radiative losses at the deep-subwavelength scale. By carefully designing radiative losses at the nanoscale, we demonstrate a non-Hermitian plasmonic-dielectric metasurface in the visible with non-trivial topology. The metasurface is based on a fourth order passive parity-time symmetric system. The designed device exhibits an exceptional concentric ring in its momentum space and is described by a Hamiltonian with a non-Hermitian Z(3) topological invariant of V = -1. Fabricated devices are characterized using Fourier-space imaging for single-shot k-space measurements. Our results demonstrate a way to combine topology and non-Hermitian nanophotonics for designing robust devices with novel functionalities.

ABSTRACT: Second-order photonic topological insulators (SPTIs) with topologically protected corner states provide a unique platform for realizing the robust manipulation of light in lower dimensions. Previous SPTIs proposed in C (4v )-symmetric lattices are mainly based on the two-dimensional (2D) Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model consisting of an even number of sites in the unit cell. Moreover, second-order topological phases within high-order band gaps are rarely explored. Here, we propose a new principle of SPTIs beyond the 2D SSH model, which is realized in C (4v)-symmetric lattices consisting of an odd number of sites in the unit cell. The midgap-gap-ratios of these odd-order band gaps, from the first-order to the nineteenth-order with step of two-order, are maximized by the method of topology optimization. Second-order topological phases are successfully created within these sizeable band gaps and highly localized corner states are observed. Our work offers a new route for exploring high-order topological states in photonics and other classical systems.

ABSTRACT: Tunability of topological photonic structures opens a new avenue for photonics research. The rich physical characteristics of the topological photonics have great significance in practical implementations. In this paper, multi-type topological states are demonstrated in higher-order photonic topological insulators based on Kagome metal lattices. By stretching or rotating Kagome metal lattices, two types of topological insulators are obtained, and multi-type topological states are observed. By stretching Kagome metal lattices, a 1D topological edge state and two types of higher-order topological corner states (corresponding to a traditional higher-order topological corner state based on nearest-neighbor coupling and a new higher-order corner state caused by long-range interactions) are obtained in a classical quantization of dipole moments higher-order topological insulators. By rotating Kagome metal lattices, dual-band higher-order valley-Hall topological insulators are achieved with nodal ring degeneracy. Odd-type and even-type topological states are obtained. Achieving reconfigurable, multi-type, and multi-band topological insulators by using a single structural unit provides interesting insights into topological photonics and provides an unconventional approach to explore photonic systems and condensed matter physics.

ABSTRACT: The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model is likely the simplest one-dimensional concept to study nontrivial topological phases and topological excitations. Originally developed to explain the electric conductivity of polyacetylene, it has become a platform for the study of topological effects in electronics, photonics, and ultracold atomic systems. Here, we propose an experimentally feasible implementation of the SSH model based on coupled one-dimensional acoustic nanoresonators working in the gigahertz-terahertz range. In this simulator it is possible to implement different signs of the nearest-neighbor interaction terms, showing full tunability of all parameters in the SSH model. Based on this concept we construct topological transition points generating nanophononic edge and interface states and propose an easy experimental scheme to directly probe their spatial complex amplitude distribution by well-established optical pump-probe techniques.

ABSTRACT: Exceptional points are branch point singularities in the parameter space of a system at which two or more eigenvalues, and their corresponding eigenvectors, coalesce and become degenerate. Such peculiar degeneracies are distinct features of non-Hermitian systems, which do not obey conservation laws because they exchange energy with the surrounding environment. Non-Hermiticity has been of great interest in recent years, particularly in connection with the quantum mechanical notion of parity-time symmetry, after the realization that Hamiltonians satisfying this special symmetry can exhibit entirely real spectra. These concepts have become of particular interest in photonics because optical gain and loss can be integrated and controlled with high resolution in nanoscale structures, realizing an ideal playground for non-Hermitian physics, parity-time symmetry, and exceptional points. As we control dissipation and amplification in a nanophotonic system, the emergence of exceptional point singularities dramatically alters their overall response, leading to a range of exotic optical functionalities associated with abrupt phase transitions in the eigenvalue spectrum. These concepts enable ultrasensitive measurements, superior manipulation of the modal content of multimode lasers, and adiabatic control of topological energy transfer for mode and polarization conversion. Non-Hermitian degeneracies have also been exploited in exotic laser systems, new nonlinear optics schemes, and exotic scattering features in open systems. Here we review the opportunities offered by exceptional point physics in photonics, discuss recent developments in theoretical and experimental research based on photonic exceptional points, and examine future opportunities in this area from basic science to applied technology.

ABSTRACT: Recent developments in topological photonics have shown that the introduction of disorders can yield the innovative and striking transport phenomena. Here, we theoretically investigate topological one-way edge states in radius-fluctuated photonic Chern topological insulators (PCTIs), which are composed of two-dimensional gyromagnetic photonic crystals with cylinder site fixed but with cylinder radius fluctuated. We use a fluctuation index to characterize the degree of radius fluctuation, employ two empirical parameters to inspect the evolution of topological one-way edge states, and verify the stability of topological one-way edge states by calculating massive samples with various random numbers. We find that as the radius-fluctuation strength increases, there arises a competition between topological one-way edge state, Anderson localization state and trivial bulk state. We reveal that the Anderson localization state appears far more easily in the radius-fluctuation PCTI with even a weak strength compared with the position-perturbed PCTI with a strong randomness. We also demonstrate that the topological one-way edge states are protected against a strong fluctuation much larger than the fabrication errors in practical experiments. Our results show that the PCTIs consisting of gyromagnetic photonic crystals have a high-tolerance for the material and sample fabrication errors, and this would provide a deeper understanding of fundamental topology physics.

ABSTRACT: Here, we theoretically demonstrate that if a Gaussian optical vortex is distorted by a random phase screen (diffuser) then the average intensity distribution in the focus of a spherical lens has a form of a ring with a nonzero value on the optical axis. The radius of the average-intensity ring depends on both the topological charge of an optical vortex and on the diffusing power of the diffuser. Therefore, the value of the topological charge cannot be unambiguously determined from the radius of the average intensity ring. However, the value of the topological charge of the optical vortex can be obtained from the number of points of phase singularity that can be determined using a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor. It is also shown that if we use a linear combination of two optical vortices, then the average intensity distribution has local maxima, the number of which is equal to the difference of the topological charges of the two original vortices. The number of these maxima no longer depends on the scattering force of the diffuser and can serve as an indicator for optical vortex identification. Modeling and experiments confirm the theoretical conclusions.

ABSTRACT: Controlling and manipulating surface waves is highly beneficial for imaging applications, nanophotonic device design, and light-matter interactions. While deep-subwavelength structuring of the metal-dielectric interface can influence surface waves by forming strong effective anisotropy, it disregards important structural degrees of freedom such as the interplay between corrugation periodicity and depth and its effect on the beam transport. Here, we unlock these degrees of freedom, introducing weakly modulated metasurfaces, structured metal-dielectric surfaces beyond effective medium. We utilize groove-structuring with varying depths and periodicities to demonstrate control over the transport of surface waves, dominated by the depth-period interplay. We show unique backward focusing of surface waves driven by an umklapp process-momentum relaxation empowered by the periodic nature of the structure and discover a yet unexplored, dual-stage topological transition. Our findings can be applied to any type of guided wave, introducing a simple and versatile approach for controlling wave propagation in artificial media.

ABSTRACT: Plasmonics is a technology aiming at light modulation via collective charge oscillations. Topological insulators, where Dirac-like metallic surfaces coexist with normal insulating bulk, have recently attracted great attention in plasmonics due to their topology-originated outstanding properties. Here, we introduce a new methodology for controlling the interaction of a plasmon with a phonon in topological insulators, which is a key for utilizing the unique spectral profiles for photonic applications. By using both static and ultrafast terahertz spectroscopy, we show that the interaction can be tuned by controlling the chemical composition of (Bi1-xInx)(2)Se-3 microribbon arrays. The topological quantum-phase transition induced by varying the composition drives a dramatic change in the strength of the plasmon phonon interaction. This was possible due to the availability of manipulating the spatial overlap between topological surface plasmonic states and underlying bulk phonons. Especially, we control the laser-induced ultrafast evolution of the transient spectral peaks arising from the plasmon-phonon interaction by varying the spatial overlap across the topological phase transition. This study may provide a new platform for realizing topological insulator-based ultrafast plasmonic devices.

ABSTRACT: Coupled optical waveguide arrays, in which the wave tunnelling dynamics resembles that of electrons in crystals, have been utilized as a versatile tool to demonstrate topological phenomena. So far, the study of topological phases in waveguide arrays mostly focused on the supermodes constituted by the fundamental modes of single waveguide while the high-order modes with orbital angular momentum (OAM) are rarely considered. Here the topological bound modes are investigated in a zigzag chain composed of evanescently coupled waveguides that support OAM modes. We show the topological propagation is aroused by OAM without discovering any bound modes generated by fundamental modes. The reason lies in the coupling of OAM modes between adjacent waveguides naturally gives rise to synthetical gauge fields, significantly different from fundamental modes. Furthermore, we study the coupling mechanism of elliptical waveguides and show the orientation angle of ellipses serves as gauge fields as well, which provides an additional degree of freedom to control topological bound modes.

ABSTRACT: The topological invariants of a periodic system can be used to define the topological phase of each band and determine the existence of topological interface states within a certain bandgap. Here, we propose a scheme based on the full phase diagrams, and design the topological interface states within any specified bandgaps. As an example, here we propose a kind of one-dimensional phononic crystals. By connecting two semi-infinite structures with different topological phases, the interface states within any specific bandgap or their combinations can be achieved in a rational manner. The existence of interface states in a single bandgap, in all odd bandgaps, in all even bandgaps, or in all bandgaps, are verified in simulations and experiments. The scheme of full phase diagrams we introduce here can be extended to other kinds of periodic systems, such as photonic crystals and designer plasmonic crystals.

ABSTRACT: The nonlinear optical (NLO) materials are playing a crucial role in almost all aspects of photonics including imaging frequency, manipulation, photon generation, transmission and detection. The nonlinear optics aims to investigate light response in NLO media, in which the NLO response is normally weak and low energy efficient. A comprehensive summary, discussion, and correlation of the light-matter interaction in the 2D nano-platform, like graphene and TMDCs, would be inspirational and timely needed. In this contribution, a broad overview and discussion about recent experimental evolution regarding the NLO response and its corresponding applications in various 2D materials are presented. A wide material library including graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides, black phosphorus, MXenes, semimetals, polymer materials, and hybrid structures (0D, 1D, 3D) are discussed. In this review, the qualitative description of NLO is firstly illustrated, followed by various fundamental NLO processes being highlighted. Fundamental limits of nonlinear optics and some of NLO applications are prospected. It is hoped that this comprehensive review will shed a light on the development of nonlinear optics with 2D materials to be applied in the field of photonics and optoelectronics.

ABSTRACT: The protected electron states at the boundaries or on the surfaces of topological insulators (TIs) have been the subject of intense theoretical and experimental investigations. Such states are enforced by very strong spin-orbit interaction in solids composed of heavy elements. Here, we study the composite particles-chiral excitons-formed by the Coulomb attraction between electrons and holes residing on the surface of an archetypical 3D TI, Bi2Se3. Photoluminescence (PL) emission arising due to recombination of excitons in conventional semiconductors is usually unpolarized because of scattering by phonons and other degrees of freedom during exciton thermalization. On the contrary, we observe almost perfectly polarization-preserving PL emission from chiral excitons. We demonstrate that the chiral excitons can be optically oriented with circularly polarized light in a broad range of excitation energies, even when the latter deviate fromthe (apparent) optical band gap by hundreds of millielectronvolts, and that the orientation remains preserved even at room temperature. Based on the dependences of the PL spectra on the energy and polarization of incident photons, we propose that chiral excitons are made from massive holes and massless (Dirac) electrons, both with chiral spin textures enforced by strong spin-orbit coupling. A theoretical model based on this proposal describes quantitatively the experimental observations. The optical orientation of composite particles, the chiral excitons, emerges as a general result of strong spin-orbit coupling in a 2D electron system. Our findings can potentially expand applications of TIs in photonics and optoelectronics.

ABSTRACT: Incorporating topological physics into the realm of quantum photonics holds the promise of developing quantum light emitters with inherent topological robustness and immunity to backscattering. Nonetheless, the deterministic interaction of quantum emitters with topologically nontrivial resonances remains largely unexplored. Here we present a single photon emitter that utilizes a single semiconductor quantum dot, deterministically coupled to a second-order topological corner state in a photonic crystal cavity. By investigating the Purcell enhancement of both single photon count and emission rate within this topological cavity, we achieve an experimental Purcell factor of Fp = 3.7. Furthermore, we demonstrate the on-demand emission of polarized single photons, with a second-order autocorrelation function g(2)(0) as low as 0.024 +/- 0.103. Our approach facilitates the customization of light-matter interactions in topologically nontrivial environments, thereby offering promising applications in the field of quantum photonics. We achieve the first deterministic coupling of a topological corner state with a single quantum dot, observing Purcell enhancement and polarized single-photon emission. This extends the effect of higher-order topological phase into the quantum realm.

ABSTRACT: Topological phonon polaritons (TPhPs) are localized boundary modes arising from the combination of topological photonics and phonon polaritons in micro/nanostructures made of polar dielectrics, which are capable of mediating long-range radiative heat transfer and infrared sensing in a robust manner. This work shows TPhPs can be sustained in a family of one-dimensional quasiperiodic silicon carbide nanopar-ticle (NP) chains, and can significantly improve radiative heat transfer for these arrays. This family of 1D quasiperiodic lattices is a continuous interpolation between the two paradigmatic limits, viz., the off -diagonal Aubry-Andre-Harper (AAH) chain and the Fibonacci chain. For different interpolation parameters tau, the band structures are calculated with respect to the modulation phase phi as the wavenumber in a synthetic dimension, where a series of gaps and midgap edge states can be observed. These edge states are shown to be topologically protected by applying the gap-labeling theorem and the principle of bulk -boundary correspondence. By means of many-body radiative heat transfer theory for a group of electric dipoles, it is shown quasiperiodicity and topological property can have an important impact on radiative heat transfer. These results can give useful insights on the interplay among topological order, long-range quasiperiodic order, near-field electromagnetic interactions and radiative heat transfer.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics has emerged recently as a smart approach for realizing robust optical circuitry, and the study of nonlinear effects is expected to open the door for tunability of photonic topological states. Here we realize experimentally nonlinearity-induced spectral tuning of electromagnetic topological edge states in arrays of coupled nonlinear resonators in the pump-probe regime. When nonlinearity is weak, we observe that the frequencies of the resonators exhibit spectral shifts concentrated mainly at the edge mode and affecting only weakly the bulk modes. For a strong pumping, we describe several scenarios of the transformation of the edge states and their hybridization with bulk modes, and also predict a parametrically driven transition from topological stationary to unstable dynamic regimes.

ABSTRACT: Second-order topological insulators (SOTIs) have recently attracted much attention due to their capability to support lower-dimensional topological states, namely, the corner states. Here, we demonstrate that properly designed supercell metasurfaces can support photonic corner states, meanwhile further serving as an ideal platform for the implementations of topological polaritons and dynamically reconfigurable corner states by assembling two-dimensional materials. Such metasurfaces consist of an array of finite-sized SOils mimicking the two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. We reveal that the topological transition happens in unit cells without the bandgap, and nondegenerate multipolar corner states emerge in the supercell metasurface due to the inter- and intrasupercell coupling effects. Especially since these corner states are above the light line of the metasurface, we realize the collective stimulation of the two dipolar corner states and their superposition state via far-field excitation. By stacking monolayer hexagonal boron nitride film onto the metasurface, we further achieve the topological phonon polaritons through the strong coupling between the corner state and the phonon, which is confirmed by the Rabi splitting as well as anticrossing behavior emerging in the transmission spectra. Furthermore, we reveal the robustness of the corner state and strong coupling by introducing defects into the metasurface. Finally, tunable corner state and strong coupling with on-demand control are realized by assembling monolayer graphene onto the metasurface. Our theoretical study proposes a unique hybrid-material platform for topological polaritonics and reconfigurable topological photonics, which can promote large-area topological applications in practice.

ABSTRACT: Recent technological advances in integrated photonics have spurred on the study of topological phenomena in engineered bosonic systems. Indeed, the controllability of silicon ring-resonator arrays has opened up new perspectives for building lattices for photons with topologically nontrivial bands and integrating them into photonic devices for practical applications. Here, we push these developments even further by exploiting the different modes of a silicon ring resonator as an extra dimension for photons. Tunneling along this synthetic dimension is implemented via an external time-dependent modulation that allows for the generation of engineered gauge fields. We show how this approach can be used to generate a variety of exciting topological phenomena in integrated photonics, ranging from a topologically-robust optical isolator in a spatially one-dimensional (1D) ring-resonator chain to a driven-dissipative analog of the 4D quantum Hall effect in a spatially 3D resonator lattice. Our proposal paves the way towards the use of topological effects in the design of novel photonic lattices supporting many frequency channels and displaying higher connectivities.

ABSTRACT: A higher-order topological photonic crystal GaAs/AlGaAs/GaAs nanowire array laser based on 0D corner modes is proposed and analyzed. The structure is composed of a nanowire trivial photonic crystal sandwiched by two topological photonic crystals. Compared with the conventional deformed honeycomb lattice photonic crystal structure, an additional mode selection mechanism is introduced by adjusting the coupling strength of topo-logical cavities formed at two topological interfaces. By optimizing the structure parameters, a large side-mode suppression ratio of 24 dB and a high-quality factor of 7935 are obtained. Due to the strong mode confinement, lasing is achievable at an ultrasmall diameter of 86 nm, with a high confinement factor of 7.96 and low threshold gain of 230 cm-1. Moreover, the laser exhibits a small beam divergence of 6.6 degrees. This work may pave a way for the development of low-threshold single-mode miniaturized lasers.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonic systems, with their ability to host states protected against disorder and perturbation, allow us to do with photons what topological insulators do with electrons. Topological photonics can refer to electronic systems coupled with light or purely photonic setups. By shrinking these systems to the nanoscale, we can harness the enhanced sensitivity observed in nanoscale structures and combine this with the protection of the topological photonic states, allowing us to design photonic local density of states and to push towards one of the ultimate goals of modern science: the precise control of photons at the nanoscale. This is paramount for both nanotechnological applications and fundamental research in light matter problems. For purely photonic systems, we work with bosonic rather than fermionic states, so the implementation of topology in these systems requires new paradigms. Trying to face these challenges has helped in the creation of the exciting new field of topological nanophotonics, with far-reaching applications. In this article, we review milestones in topological photonics and discuss how they can be built upon at the nanoscale. (C) 2019 Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Strong spin momentum coupling in topological insulators gives rise to topological surface states, protected against disorder scattering by time reversal symmetry. The study of these exotic quantum states not only provides an opportunity to explore fundamental phenomenon in condensed matter physics, such as the spin Hall effect, but also lays the foundation for applications in quantum computing to spintronics. Conventional electrical measurements suffer from substantial bulk interference, making it difficult to clearly identify topological surface state from the bulk. We use terahertz time-domain spectroscopy to study the temperature-dependent optical behavior of a 23-quintuple-thick film of bismuth selenide (Bi2Se3), allowing the deconvolution of the surface state response from the bulk. The signatures of the topological surface state at low temperatures (<30 K) with the optical conductance of Bi2Se3 exhibiting a metallic behavior are observed. Measurement of carrier dynamics results in an optical mobility exceeding 2000 cm(2)/V-s at 4 K, indicative of a surface-dominated response. A scattering lifetime of similar to 0.18 ps and a carrier density of 6 x 10(12) cm(-2) at 4 K were obtained from the terahertz time domain spectroscopy measurement. The terahertz conductance spectra reveal characteristic features at 1.9 THz, attributed to the optical phonon mode, which becomes less prominent with falling temperature. The electrical transport measurements reveal weak antilocalization behavior in our Bi2Se3 sample, consistent with the presence of a topological surface state.

ABSTRACT: We exploit topological edge states in resonant photonic crystals to attain strongly localized resonances and demonstrate lasing in these modes upon optical excitation. The use of virtually lossless topologically isolated edge states may lead to a class of thresholdless lasers operating without inversion. One needs, however, to understand whether topological states may be coupled to external radiation and act as active cavities. We study a two-level topological insulator and show that self-induced transparency pulses can directly excite edge states. We simulate laser emission by a suitably designed topological cavity and show that it can emit tunable radiation. For a configuration of sites following the off-diagonal Aubry-Andre-Harper model, we solve the Maxwell-Bloch equations in the time domain and provide a first-principles confirmation of topological lasers. Our results open the road to a class of light emitters with topological protection for applications ranging from low-cost energetically effective integrated laser sources, also including silicon photonics, to strong-coupling devices for studying ultrafast quantum processes with engineered vacuum.

ABSTRACT: Square-root topology is one of the newest additions to the ever expanding field of topological insulators (TIs). It characterizes systems that relate to their parent TI through the squaring of their Hamiltonians. Extensions to 2 n -root topology, where n is the number of squaring operations involved in retrieving the parent TI, were quick to follow. Here, we go one step further and develop the framework for designing general n-root TIs, with n any positive integer, using the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model as the parent TI from which the higher-root versions are constructed. The method relies on using loops of unidirectional couplings as building blocks, such that the resulting model is non-Hermitian and embedded with a generalized chiral symmetry. Edge states are observed at the n branches of the complex energy spectrum, appearing within what we designate as a ring gap, shown to be irreducible to the usual point or line gaps. We further detail on how such an n-root model can be realistically implemented in photonic ring systems. Near perfect unidirectional effective couplings between the main rings can be generated via mediating link rings with modulated gains and losses. These induce high imaginary gauge fields that strongly suppress couplings in one direction, while enhancing them in the other. We use these photonic lattices to validate and benchmark the analytical predictions. Our results introduce a new class of high-root topological models, as well as a route for their experimental realization.

ABSTRACT: We demonstrated the dual-wavelength simultaneously Q-switched Nd : Lu2O3 laser with a topological insulator Bi2Se3 as the Q-switcher. The continuous-wave Nd : Lu2O3 crystal laser with the slope efficiency of 31% was achieved, and the first Nd : Lu2O3 pulsed laser operation was reported, as far as we know. By using the wavelength-insensitive saturable absorption of topological insulators, the dual wavelength of the Nd : Lu2O3 crystal laser can be Q-switched simultaneously without the frequency selection of the saturable absorber, since the emission cross-sections of Nd : Lu2O3 at the wavelengths of 1077 and 1081 nm are comparable. The results indicate that the topological insulator is wavelength-insensitive and should be suitable for the dual-wavelength simultaneously Q-switched laser as a passive Q-switcher. It can be proposed that this work would provide an efficient technology for the dual-wavelength simultaneously Q-switched laser, which has promising applications in many regimes.

ABSTRACT: Recent development of topological photonics has enabled photonic energy flow robust against disorders. On the other hand, waveguiding in substrate-integrated planar platforms is significant for microwave and mm-wave technology. Here, we propose substrate-integrated topological photonic crystals (PhCs) that support robust pseudospin-dependent edge states. We verify the robustness of pseudospin-dependent electromagnetic-wave (EM-wave) energy transport through sharply twisted corners, random defects, or a channel intersection both numerically and experimentally at microwave frequencies. The present topological PhCs with planar forms, small thicknesses, and excellent electrical shielding pave the way toward manipulation of EM topological pseudospins in an integrated platform.

ABSTRACT: The sixth generation (6 G) communication standard is expected to include support for very-high data rates (over 100 Gbit/s) and device electronics will require processors with on-chip communications able to support such high bandwidths. Although the terahertz band possesses ample bandwidth, conventional THz waveguides suffer from high bending losses and are sensitive to process defects. The recent revelation of the topological valley photonic crystal (VPC), which exhibits near zero-loss bends, zero back-scattering and zero junction-area, holds much promise for future high speed inter-device communications. Low dispersion in the photonic bandgap region as the number of bends increase is demonstrated through simulation and experiment of the transmission and group delay characteristics. Through comprehensive communications experiments we demonstrate online results below the forward error correction level including an 108-Gbit/s bit rate using multi-level modulation for a 10 mm straight VPC waveguide and a 62.5-Gbit/s bit-rate for a ten sharp bended structure.

ABSTRACT: Recent advances in non-Hermitian topological phases have exploited the unusual features in photonics systems. In particular, the coupling effect and parity-time (PT) symmetry have been found to jointly determine the transition of topological edge states, which have yet to be detected directly in coupled PT-symmetric waveguides. In this work, we use a finite waveguide array described by the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model to explicitly reveal the relation between the topological states and PT symmetry and unveil the condition for the coexistence of topological edge states and PT phases. Microwave-near-field experiments have revealed non-trivial edge states in both exact- and broken-PT phases in ultrathin corrugated metallic coupled waveguide arrays. This work thus establishes an integrated microwave waveguide platform based on which more interesting physics and functional devices related to topological photonics and PT symmetry may be developed.

ABSTRACT: There are two prominent applications of the mathematical concept of topology to the physics of materials: band topology, which classifies different topological insulators and semimetals, and topological defects that represent immutable deviations of a solid lattice from its ideal crystalline form. Although these two classes of topological phenomena have generally been treated separately, recent experimental advancements have begun to probe their intricate and surprising interactions, in solid-state materials as well as in metamaterials. Topological lattice defects in topological materials offer a platform to explore a diverse range of phenomena, such as robust topological-bound states, fractional charges, topological Wannier cycles, chiral and gravitational anomalies, topological lasers and topological-defect-induced pumping and non-Hermitian skin effects. In this Perspective article, we survey the developments in this rapidly moving field from both theoretical and experimental perspectives, with an emphasis on the latter. We also give an outlook on the potential impact of these phenomena on condensed matter physics, photonics, acoustics and materials science. Topological lattice defects in topological materials offer a platform to explore a diverse range of phenomena, including fractional charges, chiral and gravitational anomalies, topological lasers and non-Hermitian skin effects.

ABSTRACT: An array of linear resonators with alternating linear nonlinear bonds can transition from a topologically trivial to a nontrivial band structure as a function of the applied intensity. Here, we demonstrate that edge modes supported by the topology of the band diagram in such arrays can evolve into solitons, sustained by propagating domain walls induced by the local intensity distribution. The character of the nonlinear response is related to intensity-induced topological transitions in band theory, and it can be successfully captured by a continuum model. Our findings open up opportunities for self-reconfigurable topologically protected signal transport in various wave systems from optics to acoustics.

ABSTRACT: Photonics: finding one-way pathways in unlikely places Optical circuits that provide high-speed data traffic even in the presence of unexpected defects can now be fabricated from materials with less than perfect crystallinity. In photonic topological insulators, interactions between crystal energy bands produce unique 'edge states' that enable photons to move in one direction. Yidong Chong and Baile Zhang from Nanyang Technological University in Singapore and colleagues have investigated how disorder impacts the formation of these edge states. The team placed gyromagnetic cylindrical rods into a waveguide and arranged them in patterns ranging from periodic to completely unstructured. Probing the waveguide with microwave radiation revealed that short-range interactions enabled the one-way states to persist in amorphous structures until the lattice transformed into a liquid-like structure. The amorphous edge states proved robust enough to pass photons around rectangular obstacles and across large air gaps. The current understanding of topological insulators and their classical wave analogs, such as photonic topological insulators, is mainly based on topological band theory. However, standard band theory does not apply to amorphous phases of matter, which are formed by non-crystalline lattices with no long-range positional order but only short-range order, exhibiting unique phenomena such as the glass-to-liquid transition. Here, we experimentally investigate amorphous variants of a Chern number-based photonic topological insulator. By tuning the disorder strength in the lattice, we demonstrate that photonic topological edge states can persist into the amorphous regime prior to the glass-to-liquid transition. After the transition to a liquid-like lattice configuration, the signatures of topological edge states disappear. This interplay between topology and short-range order in amorphous lattices paves the way for new classes of non-crystalline topological photonic bandgap materials.

ABSTRACT: Introduction of a diffractive axicon in a pulse shaper enables imparting topological-spectral correlation to ultrafast pulses over 200 nm in the visible region and with topological charges up to 80. The synthesis of ultrashort pulses with simultaneously tailored spatial and temporal properties opens new horizons in multimode photonics, especially when the spatial degree of freedom is controlled by robust topological structures. Current methods to shape space-time beams with correlations between their topological charges and spectral components have yielded fascinating phenomena. However, shaping is currently limited to narrow topological and/or spectral bands, greatly constraining the breadth of achievable spatiotemporal dynamics. Here we introduce a Fourier space-time shaper for ultrabroadband pulses, covering nearly 50% of the visible spectrum and carrying a wide range of topological charges with values up to 80. Instead of relying on a conventional grating with linear geometry, our approach employs a diffractive axicon with circular geometry that allows to impart azimuthal phase modulations to beams carrying orbital angular momentum. We retrieve the spatiotemporal field by introducing a characterization technique based on hyperspectral off-axis holography. The tailoring of linear topological-spectral correlations enables the control of several properties of wave packets, including their chirality, orbital radius and number of intertwined helices, whereas complex correlations allow us to manipulate their dynamics. Our space-time beams with broadband topological content will enable a host of novel applications in ultrafast light-matter excitations, microscopy and multiplexing.

ABSTRACT: "For all-optical communication and information processing, it is necessary to develop all-optical logic gates based on photonic structures that can directly perform logic operations. All-optical logic gates have been demonstrated based on conventional waveguides and interferometry, as well as photonic crystal structures. Nonetheless, any defects in those structures will introduce high scattering loss, which compromises the fidelity and contrast ratio of the information process. Based on the spin-valley locking effect that can achieve defect-immune unidirectional transmission of topological edge states in valley photonic crystals (VPCs), we propose a high-performance all-optical logic OR gate based on a VPC structure. By tuning the working bandwidth of the two input channels, we prevent interference between the two channels to achieve a stable and high-fidelity output. The transmittance of both channels is higher than 0.8, and a high contrast ratio of 28.8 dB is achieved. Moreover, the chirality of the logic gate originated from the spin-valley locking effect allows using different circularly polarized light as inputs, representing 1 or 0, which is highly desired in quantum computing. The device's footprint is 18 & mu m x 12 & mu m, allowing high-density on-chip integration. In addition, this design can be experimentally fabricated using current nanofabrication techniques and will have potential applications in optical communication, information processing, and quantum computing."

ABSTRACT: Passively harmonic mode locking (HML) operation had been demonstrated in an erbium-doped fiber laser with a microfiber-based topological insulator (TI) Bi2Te3 saturable absorber (SA). It was found that the pulse train possessed different orders of HML (with a tunable repetition rate from 232 to 390 MHz) due to different incident pump powers. The spectra exhibited typical features of conventional solitons (perfect Gaussian profile with Kelly sidebands) with no continuous wave component. The measured signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) reached 60 dB, whereas the pulse duration was kept around 1.32 ps without significant change. The experimental observation revealed that the microfiber-based TI device could indeed be employed as a high-performance SA for further applications in ultrafast photonics.

ABSTRACT: Floquet topological insulators (FTIs) have richer topological properties than static systems. In this work, we designed different domain wall (DW) structures consisting of a Floquet photonic lattice with opposite helical directions. We investigated the existence and types of edge states in three shared coupling structures and the impact of these shared coupling structures on edge states. When two opposite helical lattices share a straight waveguide array coupling, the edge states are localized on the straight waveguide. When two opposite helical lattices share a clockwise (or anticlockwise) helical waveguide array coupling, the DWs consist of zigzag and bearded edges, but the positions of the zigzag and bearded edges of the shared clockwise waveguide array are different from those of the shared anticlockwise waveguide array. The slope and transmission rate of the edge states both vary with the degree of coupling between the shared waveguides. The characteristics of these edge states, such as transmission speed and band gap width, are also affected by the incidence angle, modulation phase factor, and helical radii, and the methods for controlling the edge states in different shared coupling structures are provided. This will help deepen our understanding of how topological structures influence the electronic and photonic properties of materials. This could also lead to combining topology with metasurface-based structured light, which would highlight many novel properties with great application potential for various fields, such as imaging, metrology, communication, quantum information processing, and light-matter interaction.

ABSTRACT: The precise control of multicomponent complex topological configurations integrating more than one compound or one crystal phase with high spatial and angular precision is extremely challenging due to anisotropic noncovalent interaction and undesirable phase separation. Herein, we present a superstacking self-assembly approach via noncovalent interaction strength (vertical bar EBGP-TCNB (-3.14 kcal mol(-1))vertical bar > |EBGP-TFP (-2.84 kcal mol(-1))vertical bar > |EBGP-OFN (-2.15 kcal mol(-1))vertical bar > vertical bar E-BGP (-1.33 kcal mol(-1))vertical bar) adjustment for the fine synthesis of molecular heterostructures with various photophysical properties and lowdimensional morphologies, as well as phase heterostructures with multifunctional optoelectrical characteristics and multidimensional morphologies. Notably, the anisotropic noncovalent interaction and lattice matching principle facilitate the sequential crystallization and horizontal/longitudinal growth in the crystal-puzzle process, respectively. This super-stacking self-assembly approach is amenable to precise design and fine synthesis of desirable organic multicomponent complex topological configurations for integrated optoelectronics.

ABSTRACT: Second-order topological corner states are of great importance in the field of topological photonics. In particular, for realizing disorder-immune coherent nanosources based on nonlinear processes one needs multiband topological corner states. This work reports dual band second-order topological corner states in the structure of valley-Hall hexagonal photonic crystals. When the ratio between the radii of dielectric cylinders in the unit cells continuously increases, bulk gap opening, appearance of edge states, edge gap opening, and generation of second-order corner states successively occur in the first and third bandgaps. By changing the structural parameters, the eigenfrequencies of the corner states in both edge gaps can be flexibly adjusted. Compared with square-lattice valley-Hall systems, large difference of eigenfrequencies of corner states in dual bandgaps can be obtained with hexagonal photonic crystals, which is the key advantage of the proposed systems for applications in nonlinear coherent generations such as second-harmonic generation. The numerical results show that the dual band second-order corner states clearly exhibit robustness against structural defects, significantly distinguished from the defect states. The results presented in this work pave the way toward topologically protected coherent nanosources by nonlinear frequency conversion which are robust against structural disorder or defects.

ABSTRACT: Zero-energy topological states, which are protected by chiral symmetry against certain perturbations topologically, localize at interfaces between trivial and non-trivial phases in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain model. Here, we propose and demonstrate a method to manipulate chiral symmetry itself to improve the localized interfaces and enlarge the mode volume of topological states in the SSH model, thus optimizing the lasing performance of localized interfaces. As multiple defects corresponding to off-diagonal perturbations in an eigenmatrix are introduced, the topological state expands and extends to extra defects at the topological interface without breaking chiral symmetry. We apply the proposed method in electrical pumping semiconductor laser arrays to verify our theoretical prediction and optimize the output characteristics of the devices. The measured results of the proposed multi-defect SSH laser array show that the output power has been increased by 27%, and the series resistance and far-field divergence have been reduced by half compared to the traditional SSH laser array, establishing a high-performance light source for integrated silicon photonics, infrared light detection and ranging, and so on. Our work demonstrates that the proposed method is capable of improving topological localized interfaces and redistributing zero-energy topological states. Furthermore, our method can be applied to other platforms and inspire optimizations of more devices in broader areas. (c) 2023 Chinese Laser Press

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics provides a fundamental framework for robust manipulation of light, including directional transport and localization with built-in immunity to disorder. Combined with an optical gain, active topological cavities hold special promise for a design of light-emitting devices. Most studies to date have focused on lasing at topological edges of finite systems or domain walls. Recently discovered higher-order topological phases enable strong high-quality confinement of light at the corners. Here, we demonstrate lasing action of corner states in nanophotonic topological structures. We identify several multipole corner modes with distinct emission profiles via hyperspectral imaging and discern signatures of non-Hermitian radiative coupling of leaky topological states. In addition, depending on the pump position in a large-size cavity, we generate selectively lasing from either edge or corner states within the topological bandgap. Our studies provide the direct observation of multipolar lasing and engineered collective resonances in active topological nanostructures. Higher-order photonic topological states, such as corner states, could enable robust and high-quality confinement of light to a small mode volume. Here, the authors demonstrate lasing from topological multipole corner states and investigate their emission profiles via hyperspectral imaging.

ABSTRACT: Owing to their extraordinary physical and chemical properties, two-dimensional (2D) materials have aroused extensive attention and have been widely used in photonic and optoelectronic devices, catalytic reactions, and biomedicine. In particular, 2D materials possess a unique bandgap structure and nonlinear optical properties, which can be used as saturable absorbers in ultrafast lasers. Here, we mainly review the top-down and bottom-up methods for preparing 2D materials, such as graphene, topological insulators, transition metal dichalcogenides, black phosphorus, and MXenes. Then, we focus on the ultrafast applications of 2D materials at the typical operating wavelengths of 1, 1.5, 2, and 3 mu m. The key parameters and output performance of ultrafast pulsed lasers based on 2D materials are discussed. Furthermore, an outlook regarding the fabrication methods and the development of 2D materials in ultrafast photonics is also presented.

ABSTRACT: Topological insulators are states of quantum matter that have narrow topological nontrivial energy gaps and a large third-order nonlinear optical response. The optical absorption of topological insulators can become saturated under strong excitation. In this work, with Bi2Se3 as an example, it was demonstrated that a topological insulator can modulate the operation of a bulk solid-state laser by taking advantage of its saturable absorption. The result suggests that topological insulators are potentially attractive as broadband pulsed modulators for the generation of short and ultrashort pulses in bulk solid-state lasers, in addition to other promising applications in physics and computing.

ABSTRACT: The functionality of many nonlinear and quantum optical devices relies on the effect of optical bistability. Using microcavity exciton-polaritons in a honeycomb arrangement of microcavity pillars, we report the resonance response and bistability of topological edge states. A balance between the pump, loss, and nonlinearity ensures a broad range of dynamical stability and controls the distribution of power between counterpropagating states on the opposite edges of the honeycomb lattice stripe. Tuning energy and polarization of the pump photons, while keeping their momentum constant, we demonstrate control of the propagation direction of the dominant edge state. Our results facilitate the development of practical applications of topological photonics.

ABSTRACT: Topological insulators (TIs) have unique highly conducting symmetry-protected surface states while the bulk is insulating, making them attractive for various applications in condensed matter physics. Recently, topological insulator materials have been tentatively applied for both near- and far-field wavefront manipulation of electromagnetic waves, yielding superior plasmonic properties in the ultraviolet (UV)-to-visible wavelength range. However, previous reports have only demonstrated inefficient wavefront control based on binary metasurfaces that were digitalized on a TI thin film or non-directional surface plasmon polariton (SPP) excitation. Here, we numerically demonstrated the plasmonic capabilities of the TI Bi2Te3 as a material for gap-surface plasmon (GSP) metasurfaces. By employing the principle of the geometric phase, a far-field beam-steering metasurface was designed for the visible spectrum, yielding a cross-polarization efficiency of 34% at 500 nm while suppressing the co-polarization to 0.08%. Furthermore, a birefringent GSP metasurface design was studied and found to be capable of directionally exciting SPPs depending on the incident polarization. Our work forms the basis for accurately controlling the far- and near-field responses of TI-based GSP metasurfaces in the visible spectral range.

ABSTRACT: We show that Floquet topological insulating states can exist in two-dimensional photonic crystals made of time-variant optical materials. By arranging the modulating phases, it facilitates effective gauge fields that give rise to topological effects. The band structures demonstrate the existence of topologically non-trivial bandgaps, thereby leading to back-scattering immune unidirectional edge states owing to bulk-edge correspondence. With these first-principle numerical results, we then verify the topological order for every Floquet band via Wilson loop approach. In the final paragraph, the possible experimental implementation for Floquet topological photonics is also discussed.

ABSTRACT: "Objective The valley topological edge states (VTESs) and resonance loops are both important in optical communication systems, but they are usually two separate structures. In this paper, multi-layer nested valley photonic topological structures are designed. The energy transfer between loops is realized through the coupling of the evanescent field. By choosing its resonance frequency or changing the position of the light source, each loop has its own resonance frequency, and single loop or multiple-layer loops can be solely excited in the nested layered structure. Compared with similar studies, the loops do not design defects to form a resonant cavity and thus retain the integrity of the valley photonic crystal structures. This design has both the functionalities of resonance and waveguide transmission and increases the density of transmission channels. The results have application value in the reconfigurable photonic circuits. Methods Quantum valley Hall effects (QVHEs) are realized by introducing angular rotation of the electron wave function at points K and K' in the first Brillouin zone (BZ), which provides an intrinsic magnetic moment, analogous to that provided by the electron spin. Similarly, vortex chirality (i. e., pseudospin) of photonic energy flow provides a new degree of freedom for optical waves via the orbital angular momentum, which can be realized by reducing the lattice rotation symmetry. By constructing different types of domain walls via these structures, valley edge states can be achieved. Firstly, it is necessary to construct a two-dimensional photonic crystal unit cell. The design of the unit cell structure in this article takes into account that Bragg-scattering not only exists between lattices but also occurs between the various medium columns within the lattice. In order to obtain a wider bandgap, the method of rotating the medium columns is used to break the spatial symmetry of the photonic crystal so that the degeneracy at the high-symmetry point K in the first BZ of the reciprocal lattice is separated, thereby showing a complete bandgap in the energy band diagram. Subsequently, by analyzing the phase difference between the two lattices at point K after rotating the medium columns (i. e., the topological invariant), it is proved that the structure has opposite topological phases at the K point, thereby indicating that the edge mode is the topological boundary mode. Secondly, by periodically arranging the two lattices, a supercell can be formed. After the frequency domain simulation, the supercell in this article has two edge states, and the spin-locked properties of the VTESs can be studied. Based on the above studies, we construct a nested loop model to achieve energy exchange between photonic crystals in the form of loop coupling. The principle of this coupling is evanescent field coupling. Compared with most current coupling methods that use waveguides and cavities, evanescent field coupling does not require the construction of waveguides or other defects or cavities. The topological edge mode of the valley photonic crystal designed in this article has great local properties and does not require additional defects. Last but not least, based on the advantages of topological properties, the design can also achieve efficient transmission while maintaining the original structure. Results and Discussions We propose a new reconfigurable topological photonic structure model, which is a multi-layer nested photonic topological ring similar to Russian dolls. Based on the one-way transmission property of topological boundary states and the theory of coupling of electromagnetic waves, a three-layer nested loop (Fig. 7) is designed. The source position is at the center of any loop, and when the frequency is the same, different source positions will excite different transmission channels of the circuit. Furthermore, keeping the source position unchanged and changing the frequency of the source can excite multiple transmission channels. According to statistics (Fig. 8 and Fig. 9), the transmission channels in the structure will exhibit diverse forms such as single external loop, single inner loop, single middle loop, as well as double loops and triple loops. Compared with other similar schemes, the model design in this paper is intuitive, and there are no transmission channels connecting the loops. Energy transmission is entirely carried out by the coupling of the evanescent field to achieve reconfigurability. Its reconfigurability does not require any external conditions, which greatly reduces the complexity and difficulty of the design. Conclusions The VTES has become a new research hotspot in topological photonics because of its flexibility and diversity. In this paper, reconfigurable topological channels in the form of multiple-layer nested loops have been designed. By combining the topological edge states of the valley photonic crystal with the resonance loops, a variety of different channels can be excited. Although the reconfigurable topological waveguides have been widely studied, the unique value of our design is that the reconfigurable method does not rely on external conditions  instead, single or multilayer circuits can be selectively excited by setting the location and frequency of the source. This model can be used as a multi-channel frequency selector or optical resonator. Different from the general selector and resonator, the channel in the structure is a topological loop, which combines the common characteristics of topological protection and resonance, so as to reduce the loss as far as possible. It provides a new idea for the application of VTESs in optical devices."

ABSTRACT: Liquid crystals are starting to attract attention for applications beyond the display technology. Their high birefringence, softness, and possibility to form complex topological defect structures allow for easy light manipulation in systems ranging from cholesteric lasers to droplet resonators and wave guides. Recent interest in light-induced topological defects and light propagation along the defects stimulated us to develop a customized version of the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method for solving Maxwell's equations on a discrete time & space lattice. Here, we present an overview of our recent simulations, modeling the time-evolution of electromagnetic fields along birefringent structures in nematic liquid crystals, specifically light propagation along nematic defect lines. In the regime of high light intensity beams the modelling approach includes also a light induced modification of local nematic ordering obtained via a qtensor free energy minimization procedure. We show how topological invariants of the nematic and polarization fields combine and also affect the beam intensity profile. Finally, off-axis propagation of beams with respect to the defect lines is considered.

ABSTRACT: Chiral exceptional points (CEPs) have been shown to emerge in traveling wave resonators via asymmetric back scattering from two or more nano-scatterers. Here, we provide a new perspective on the formation of CEPs based on the coupled oscillator model. Our approach provides an intuitive understanding for the modal coalescence that signals the emergence of CEPs and emphasizes the role played by dissipation throughout this process. In doing so, our model also unveils an otherwise unexplored connection between CEPs and other types of exceptional points associated with parity-time symmetric photonic arrangements. In addition, our model also explains qualitative results observed in recent experimental work involving CEPs. Importantly, the tight-binding nature of our approach allows us to extend the notion of CEP to discrete photonics setups that consist of coupled resonator and waveguide arrays, thus opening new avenues for exploring the exotic features of CEPs in conjunction with other interesting physical effects such as nonlinearities and topological protections.

ABSTRACT: The introduction of topological concepts to the design of photonic crystal cavities holds great promise for applications in integrated photonics due to the prospect of topological protection. This study examines the signatures of topological light confinement in the leakage radiation of 2D topological photonic crystal cavities. The cavities are implemented in an all-dielectric platform that features the photonic quantum spin Hall effect at telecom wavelengths and supports helical edge states that are weakly coupled to the radiation continuum. The modes of resonators scaling down to single point defects in the surrounding bulk lattice are characterized via spectral position and multipolar nature of the eigenstates. The mode profiles in real and momentum space are mapped using far-field imaging and Fourier-spectropolarimetry, revealing how certain properties of the cavity modes reflect on their origin in the topological bandstructure. This includes band-inversion-induced confinement and inverted scaling of mode spectra for trivial and topological defect cavities. Furthermore, hallmarks of topological protection in the loss rates are demonstrated, which are largely unaffected by cavity shape and size. The results constitute an important step toward the use of radiative topological cavities for on-chip confinement of light, control of emitted wave fronts, and enhancement of light-matter interactions.

ABSTRACT: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) have attracted attention in photonics owing to their interesting properties. For example, BICs can effectively confine light in a counterintuitive way, and the far-field radiation of photonic structures that exhibit BICs has fascinating topological characteristics. Early research into photonic BICs was primarily focused on designing artificial structures to produce BICs. However, since the mid-2010s, exploring the potential applications of BICs has been a growing trend in research. In this Review, we detail the unique properties of BICs, including the ability to achieve enhanced light confinement, sharp Fano resonances and topological characteristics. We explore phenomena derived from BICs, including the generation of circularly polarized states and unidirectional guided resonances, and the impact of BICs on various applications such as lasing, nonlinear frequency conversion, waveguiding, sensing and wavefront control. We also discuss the insights provided by BICs in several emerging research frontiers, such as parity-time symmetric systems, higher-order topology, exciton-photon coupling and moire superlattices. Photonic systems provide a versatile platform to explore and use bound states in the continuum. This Review discusses the potential of these states for enhancing light-matter interactions in various applications and investigating the physics of emerging photonic systems. Photonics provides a versatile platform to study and exploit the properties of bound states in the continuum (BICs), leading to a wide range of applications.The ability of BICs to achieve highly efficient light confinement leads to the coherent field enhancement of both electric and magnetic fields, which can improve lasing performance, nonlinear conversion efficiency and waveguiding in photonic integrated circuits.Light scattered by photonic structures exhibiting BICs manifests the features of Fano resonances, leading to advanced functionalities in refractometric sensing and the identification of molecular fingerprints.BICs are characterized as topological polarization vortices in far-field radiation, in which the geometric phases in momentum space can be used to manipulate light, giving rise to polarization conversion, vortex beam generation and beam shifts.BICs have been integrated to explore several emerging frontiers, including parity-time-symmetric systems, higher-order topology, exciton-photon coupling and moire superlattices.

ABSTRACT: In recent years, topological states in photonic artificial structures have attracted great attention due to their robustness against certain disorders and perturbations. To readily understand the underlying principles, topological edge modes in one-dimensional (1D) system have been widely investigated, which bring about the discovery of novel optical phenomena and devices. In this article, we review our recent advances in topological edge modes. We introduce the connection between topological orders and effective electromagnetic parameters of photonic artificial structures in band gaps, discuss experimental demonstration of robust topological modes and their potential applications in wireless power transfer, sensing and field of optics, and give a brief introduction of future opportunities in 1D topological photonics.

ABSTRACT: We show theoretically that a photonic topological insulator can support edge solitons that are strongly self-localized and propagate unidirectionally along the lattice edge. The photonic topological insulator consists of a Floquet lattice of coupled helical waveguides, in a medium with local Kerr nonlinearity. The soliton behavior is strongly affected by the topological phase of the linear lattice. The topologically nontrivial phase gives a continuous family of solitons, while the topologically trivial phase gives an embedded soliton that occurs at a single power and arises from a self-induced local nonlinear shift in the intersite coupling. The solitons can be used for nonlinear switching and logical operations, functionalities that have not yet been explored in topological photonics. We demonstrate using solitons to perform selective filtering via propagation through a narrow channel, and using soliton collisions for optical switching.

ABSTRACT: Approaches to generate and manipulate Cherenkov radiation (CR) are challenging yet meaningful. Optical topological transition (OTT) in novel materials and metamaterials is also promising for modern photonics. We study the OTT of CR in graphene-based hyperbolic metamaterials (GHMs) for the first time. In GHMs, conventional and hyperbolic CR can be switched when crossing the topological transition frequency. This frequency can be altered by metamaterial components and external optical elements. For instance, external ultrafast optical pumps cause an ultrafast OTT from the elliptical to the hyperbolic state. Then, hyperbolic CR can be excited by low-energy electrons by leveraging the excellent photothermal properties of graphene. Hyperbolic CR vanishes when the GHM returns to its original state. Furthermore, graphene nonlocality occurs when the electron velocity is low enough, corresponding to a large wave vector. Concretely, when the electron velocity approaches the Fermi velocity of graphene, a nonlocality-induced OTT modifies the plasmonic properties of the GHM and brings a new lower velocity threshold of hyperbolic CR. Therefore, hyperbolic CR can only be induced in a limited velocity range. These findings pave the way for understanding CR properties in active plasmonic metamaterials and may be applied to complex photonic and polaritonic systems. (C) 2022 Chinese Laser Press.

ABSTRACT: Self-assembled architectures of soft matter have fascinated scientists for centuries due to their unique physical properties originated from controllable orientational and/or positional orders, and diverse optic and photonic applications. If one could know how to design, fabricate, and manipulate these optical microstructures in soft matter systems, such as liquid crystals (LCs), that would open new opportunities in both scientific research and practical applications, such as the interaction between light and soft matter, the intrinsic assembly of the topological patterns, and the multidimensional control of the light (polarization, phase, spatial distribution, propagation direction). Here, we summarize recent progresses in self-assembled optical architectures in typical thermotropic LCs and bio-based lyotropic LCs. After briefly introducing the basic definitions and properties of the materials, we present the manipulation schemes of various LC microstructures, especially the topological and topographic configurations. This work further illustrates external-stimuli-enabled dynamic controllability of self-assembled optical structures of these soft materials, and demonstrates several emerging applications. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and opportunities of these materials towards soft matter photonics, and envision future perspectives in this field.

ABSTRACT: Topological invariants characterizing filled Bloch bands underpin electronic topological insulators and analogous artificial lattices for Bose-Einstein condensates, photonics and acoustic waves. In bosonic systems, there is no Fermi exclusion principle to enforce uniform band filling, which makes measuring their bulk topological invariants challenging. Here we show how to achieve the controllable filling of bosonic bands using leaky photonic lattices. Leaky photonic lattices host transitions between bound and radiative modes at a critical energy, which plays a role analogous to the electronic Fermi level. Tuning this effective Fermi level into a bandgap results in the disorder-robust dynamical quantization of bulk topological invariants such as the Chern number. Our findings establish leaky lattices as a highly flexible platform for exploring topological and non-Hermitian wave physics. Topological materials are characterized by the topological invariants of filled bands, which cannot be used for bosonic systems. Instead, their topological invariants can be found via the transition from bound to leaky modes in photonic lattices.

ABSTRACT: In this article, we propose a simple method to generate purely transverse spin density in a high numerical aperture system, and it is realized by focusing an amplitude tailored beam with a dipole-like shape. Through our analytical analysis, it is found that in this focused field the purely transverse spin density is not only confined in the focal plane, but also can exist in two mutually perpendicular meridional planes. Especially, the fields with purely transverse spin density are also examined from the view of topology. Two typical topological events which usually happen in traditional two dimensional transverse fields are observed in the meridional plane with purely transverse spin density, and it shows that the 'photonic wheels' follow the rule of topological index in their topological reactions. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to test the topological behavior of the field with purely transverse spin density. Our finding not only supplies a simple way to generate 'photonic wheels' in three planes of the field, but also adds new features to the field containing 'photonic wheels'.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics has revolutionized our understanding of light propagation, providing a robust way to manipulate light. So far, most of studies in this field are focused on designing a static photonic structure. Developing a dynamic photonic topological platform to switch multiple topological functionalities at ultrafast speed is still a great challenge. Here we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate a reprogrammable plasmonic topological insulator, where the topological propagation route can be dynamically changed at nanosecond-level switching time, leading to an experimental demonstration of ultrafast multi-channel optical analog-digital converter. Due to the innovative use of electric switches to implement the programmability of plasmonic topological insulator, each unit cell can be encoded by dynamically controlling its digital plasmonic states while keeping its geometry and material parameters unchanged. Our reprogrammable topological plasmonic platform is fabricated by the printed circuit board technology, making it much more compatible with integrated photoelectric systems. Furthermore, due to its flexible programmability, many photonic topological functionalities can be integrated into this versatile topological platform. The development of fast and dynamic topological photonic platforms is an ongoing challenge. Here, the authors demonstrate a reprogrammable plasmonic topological insulator in which ultrafast electric switches allow for nanosecond-level switching time between different configurations.

ABSTRACT: Here we show theoretically that a superposition of two Bessel-Gaussian (BG) beams with different topological charges (TC) and different scaling factors (radial components of the wave vectors) has the TC equal to that of the BG beam with the larger scaling factor. If the scaling factors of the BG beams are equal, then TC of the whole superposition equals TC of the BG beam with the larger (in absolute value) weight coefficient in the superposition (i.e. with larger power). If the constituent BG beams are also same-power, TC of the superposition equals the average TC of the two BG beams. Therefore, if the sum of TCs of both beams is odd, TC of the superposition is a half-integer number. In practice, however, TC is calculated over a finite radius circle and, hence, the half-integer TC for the degenerated case cannot be obtained. Instead of the half-integer TC, the lower of the two integer TCs is obtained. Numerical simulation reveals that if the weight coefficients in the superposition are slightly different, TC of the superposition is not conserved on propagation. In the near field and in the Fresnel diffraction zone, TC is equal to the highest TC of the two BG beams, while in the far field it is equal to the lower TC. What is more, TC changes its value from high to low not instantly, but continuously at some propagation distance. In the intermediate zone TC is fractional.

ABSTRACT: We propose a simple realization of topological edge states in zigzag chains of plasmonic nanoparticles, mimicking the Kitaev model of Majorana fermions. We demonstrate the one-to-one correspondence between the coupled dipole equations in the zigzag plasmonic chain and the Bogoliubov-de-Gennes equations for the quantum wire on top of superconductor and support the analytical theory by the full-wave electromagnetic simulations. We reveal that localized plasmons can be excited selectively at both edges of the zigzag chain of plasmonic nanoparticles depending on the incident plane wave polarization.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics provide a novel platform to robustly manipulate the flow of light and design high-performance nanophotonic devices. To do this, a fundamental mechanism is the flexible control of optical transport based on topological boundary states on edges or corners. In this work, we design a multiport device to route the topologically optical transport by using both valley-dependent edge states (VDESs) and second-order corner states (SOCSs). The VDESs are derived from sublattice symmetry breaking in a honeycomb lattice, while SOCSs are induced by the lattice deformation of Kagome lattice. In terms of unit cell, we find that both configurations can be reconsidered as the same triangular-lattice photonic crystal, which consists of a hexagon-profile air hole array in silicon background. Therefore, a four-port device is designed based on the two configurations. In simulation, we observe the frequency-dependent routing effect of the topologically optical transport by merging of VDESs and SOCSs. This work not only shows a novel platform to explore various topological phases in the photonic system but also provides guidance in the development of topological photonic integrated circuits with mode division multiplexing.

ABSTRACT: The discovery of topological materials has motivated recent developments to export topological concepts into photonics to make light behave in exotic ways. Here, we predict several unconventional quantum optical phenomena that occur when quantum emitters interact with a topological waveguide quantum electrodynamics bath, namely, the photonic analog of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. When the emitters' frequency lies within the topological bandgap, a chiral bound state emerges, which is located on just one side (right or left) of the emitter. In the presence of several emitters, this bound state mediates topological, tunable interactions between them, which can give rise to exotic many-body phases such as double Neel ordered states. Furthermore, when the emitters' optical transition is resonant with the bands, we find unconventional scattering properties and different super/subradiant states depending on the band topology. Last, we propose several implementations where these phenomena can be observed with state-of-the-art technology.

ABSTRACT: A Q-switched Yb:KGW solid-state laser using topological insulator Bi2Se3 as a saturable absorber was demonstrated experimentally for the first time. The Bi2Se3 saturable absorber was fabricated in a film on a highly reflective mirror. By inserting this into a Yb:KGW laser, the Q-switched operation was obtained. The highest average output power was 439.4 mW and the corresponding repetition rate, pulse width and pulse energy were 166.7 kHz, 1.6 mu s and 2.64 mu J, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the highest output power among topological insulator-modulated lasers with topological insulator absorbers.

ABSTRACT: Topological insulator lasers (TILs) are a recently introduced family of lasing arrays in which phase locking is achieved through synthetic gauge fields. These single frequency light source arrays operate in the spatially extended edge modes of topologically non-trivial optical lattices. Because of the inherent robustness of topological modes against perturbations and defects, such topological insulator lasers tend to demonstrate higher slope efficiencies as compared to their topologically trivial counterparts. So far, magnetic and non-magnetic optically pumped topological laser arrays as well as electrically pumped TILs that are operating at cryogenic temperatures have been demonstrated. Here we present the first room temperature and electrically pumped topological insulator laser. This laser array, using a structure that mimics the quantum spin Hall effect for photons, generates light at telecom wavelengths and exhibits single frequency emission. Our work is expected to lead to further developments in laser science and technology, while opening up new possibilities in topological photonics. Topological insulator lasers offer robustness and efficiency due to their unique properties but usually require cryogenic temperatures or optical pumping. Here the authors demonstrate an electrically pumped topological insulator laser operating at room temperature.

ABSTRACT: Usually, when coupling in a background gauge field, topological zero modes would yield an anomalous current at the interface, culminating in the zero-mode anomaly inflow, which is ultimately conserved by extra contributions from the topological bulk. However, the anomaly inflow mechanism for guiding Floquet steady states is rarely explored in periodically driven systems. Here we synthesize a driven topological-normal insulator heterostructure and propose a Floquet gauge anomaly inflow, associated with the occurrence of arbitrary fractional charge. Through our photonic modeling, we experimentally observed a Floquet gauge anomaly as the system was driven into anomalous topological phases. Prospectively, we believe our findings could pave a novel avenue on exploring Floquet gauge anomalies in driven systems of condensed matter, photonics, and ultracold atoms.

ABSTRACT: Sources of quantum light, in particular correlated photon pairs that are indistinguishable for all degrees of freedom, are the fundamental resource for photonic quantum computation and simulation. Although such sources have been recently realized using integrated photonics, they offer limited ability to tune the spectral and temporal correlations between generated photons because they rely on a single component, such as a ring resonator. Here, we demonstrate a tunable source of indistinguishable photon pairs using dual-pump spontaneous four-wave mixing in a topological system comprising a two-dimensional array of resonators. We exploit the linear dispersion of the topological edge states to tune the spectral bandwidth (by about 3.5x), and thereby, to tune quantum interference between generated photons by tuning the two pump frequencies. We demonstrate energy-time entanglement and, using numerical simulations, confirm the topological robustness of our source. Our results could lead to tunable, frequency-multiplexed quantum light sources for photonic quantum technologies. Indistinguishable photon pairs are generated via four-wave mixing in a two-dimensional array of ring resonators that exhibit topological edge states. They show tunable spectral-temporal correlations and robustness against fabrication disorders.

ABSTRACT: Graphene hybrids, made of thin insulators, graphene, and metals can support propagating acoustic plasmons (AGPs). The metal screening modifies the dispersion relation of usual graphene plasmons leading to slowly propagating plasmons, with record confinement of electromagnetic radiation. Here, we show that a graphene monolayer, covered by a thin dielectric material and an array of metallic nanorods, can be used as a robust platform to emulate the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. We calculate the Zak's phase of the different plasmonic bands to characterize their topology. The system shows bulk-edge correspondence: strongly localized interface states are generated in the domain walls separating arrays in different topological phases. We find signatures of the nontrivial phase which can directly be probed by far-field mid-IR radiation, hence allowing a direct experimental confirmation of graphene topological plasmons. The robust field enhancement, highly localized nature of the interface states, and their gate-tuned frequencies expand the capabilities of AGP-based devices.

ABSTRACT: Three-dimensional (3D) micro-and nanostructures have played an important role in topological photonics, microfluidics, acoustic, and mechanical engineering. Incorporating biomimetic geometries into the design of metastructures has created low-density metamaterials with extraordinary physical and photonic properties. However, the use of surface-based biomimetic geometries restricts the freedom to tune the relative density, mechanical strength, and topological phase. The Steiner tree method inspired by the feature of the shortest connection distance in biological neural networks is applied, to create 3D metastructures and, through two-photon nanolithography, neuron-inspired 3D structures with nanoscale features are successfully achieved. Two solutions are presented to the 3D Steiner tree problem: the Steiner tree networks (STNs) and the twisted Steiner tree networks (T-STNs). STNs and T-STNs possess a lower density than surface-based metamaterials and that T-STNs have Young's modulus enhanced by 20% than the STNs. Through the analysis of the space groups and symmetries, a topological nontrivial Dirac-like conical dispersion in the T-STNs is predicted, and the results are based on calculations with true predictive power and readily realizable from microwave to optical frequencies. The neuron-inspired 3D metastructures opens a new space for designing low-density metamaterials and topological photonics with extraordinary properties triggered by a twisting degree-of-freedom.

ABSTRACT: "The topological charge of an optical vortex is a quantity rather stable against phase distortions, for example, turbulence. This makes the topological charge attractive for optical communications, but for many structured beams it is unknown. Here, we derive the topological charge (TC) of a coaxial superposition of spatially coherent Laguerre-Gaussian beams with different colors, each beam with its own wavelength and its own TC. It turns out that the TC of such a superposition equals the TC of the LG beam with a longer wavelength, regardless of the weight coefficient of this beam in the superposition and regardless of its TC. It is interesting that the instantaneous TC of such a superposition is conserved on propagation, whereas the time-averaged intensity distribution of the colored optical vortex changes its gamut  if, in the near field, the colors of the light rings arrange along the radius according to their TCs in the superposition from lower to greater, then, on space propagation, the colors of the light rings in the cross-section are arranged in reverse order from the greater TC to the lower TC. We also demonstrate that, by choosing appropriate wavelengths (blue, green, and red) in a three-color superposition of single-ringed LG beams, it is possible to generate, at some propagation distance, a time-averaged light ring of the white color. If all the beams in a three-color superposition of single-ringed LG beams have the same TC, then there is a single ring of nearly white light in the initial plane. Then, on propagation in space, light rings of different colors acquire different radii: a smaller ring radius for a shorter wavelength."

ABSTRACT: Utilizing the robust transport properties of the topological photonic crystal interface, we experimentally realize two-dimensional topological photonic crystal cavities, where discrete whispering gallery modes can propagate unidirectionally along the cavity circumference. Different from traditional cavities, these topological whispering galley modes are insensitive to cavity shapes. Our microwave demonstration has a good agreement with numerical simulations. Using pure dielectrics, by scaling down to the optical wavelength, an optical directional coupler based on the same topological photonic crystal scheme is also proposed. We here show that topological photonics can provide more novel designs for optical devices. (C) 2018 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement

ABSTRACT: The discovery of topological phases has introduced new perspectives and platforms for various interesting physics originally investigated in quantum contexts and then, on an equal footing, in classic wave systems. As a characteristic feature, nontrivial Fermi arcs, connecting between topologically distinct Fermi surfaces, play vital roles in the classification of Dirac and Weyl semimetals, and have been observed in quantum materials very recently. However, in classical systems, no direct experimental observation of Fermi arcs in momentum space has been reported so far. Here, using near-field scanning measurements, we show the observation of photonic topological surface-state arcs connecting topologically distinct bulk states in a chiral hyperbolic metamaterial. To verify the topological nature of this system, we further observe backscattering-immune propagation of a nontrivial surface wave across a three-dimension physical step. Our results demonstrate a metamaterial approach towards topological photonics and offer a deeper understanding of topological phases in three-dimensional classical systems.

ABSTRACT: The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model has been the subject of extensive experimental research in the context of topological photonics. Ideally, the on-site potential and hopping strength are sufficiently accurate for implementation in photonic coupled waveguide arrays. Here, two localized edge modes, the topological zero mode and trivial Tamm mode, are proposed and demonstrated in the modified SSH model using a microwave photonic waveguide array. The system used is composed of an array of evanescently coupled ultrathin corrugated metallic H-bar waveguides. Furthermore, the differences between the zero mode and Tamm mode are clearly demonstrated by microwave near-field experiments on the coupling behavior along the propagation direction for 40 cm at the excitation frequency of 17 GHz. These findings should deepen the understanding of localized edge mode confinement mechanisms, both in coupled waveguide array systems and other topological or quantum systems.

ABSTRACT: In a two-dimensional non-Hermitian topological photonic system, the physics of topological states is complicated, which brings great challenges for clarifying the topological phase transitions and achieving precise active control. Here, we prove the topological phase transition exists in a two-dimensional paritytime-symmetric coupled-resonator optical waveguide system. We reveal the inherent condition of the appearance of topological phase transition, which is described by the analytical algebraic relation of coupling strength and the quantity of gain-loss. In this framework, the system can be switched between the topological and trivial states by pumping the site rings. This work provides a new degree of freedom to control topological states and offers a scheme for studying non-Hermitian topological photonics.

ABSTRACT: Arbitrary manipulation of broadband terahertz waves with flexible polarization shaping at the source has great potential in expanding numerous applications, such as imaging, information encryption, and all-optical coherent control of terahertz nonlinear phenomena. Topological insulators featuring unique spin-momentum-locked surface state have already exhibited very promising prospects in terahertz emission, detection, and modulation, which may lay a foundation for future on-chip topological insulator-based terahertz systems. However, polarization-shaped terahertz emitters based on topological insulators with an arbitrarily manipulated temporal evolution of the amplitude and the electric-field vector direction have not yet been explored. We systematically investigated the terahertz radiation from topological insulator Bi2Te3 nanofilms driven by femtosecond laser pulses and successfully realized the generation of efficient chiral terahertz waves with controllable chirality, ellipticity, and principal axis. The convenient engineering of the chiral terahertz waves was interpreted by a photogalvanic effect (PGE)-induced photocurrent, while the linearly polarized terahertz waves originated from linear PGE-induced shift currents. Our work not only provides further understanding of femtosecond coherent control of ultrafast spin currents but also describes an effective way to generate spin-polarized terahertz waves at the source.

ABSTRACT: It is theoretically shown that the distribution of the average intensity of Gaussian optical vortex in the focal plane of a spherical lens scattered by random phase screen has the form of a ring with non-zero value on the optical axis. The radius of the ring depends on the topological charge of the optical vortex and the scattering power of the diffuser. Therefore the topological charge cannot be determined only by the radius of the formed ring. However, it can be determined by the number of points with phase singularity for which detection Shack-Hartmann sensor is used. It is also shown that when using a linear combination of two optical vortices than the distribution of the average intensity will have local maxima the quantity of which is equal to the difference of their topological charges. The number of these maxima does not depend on the degree of diffusion and can serve as an indicator for identifying an optical vortex. Numerical simulation and experiment confirm the theoretical conclusions.

ABSTRACT: Terahertz (THz)wave wireless communication technologies have been developed to increase transmission capacity in 6G communications. Although the realization of integrated waveguides in THz wave transmitters and receivers is essential, bending loss in THz waveguides is important as well. This study investigated a THz waveguide based on a valley photonic crystal (VPC) structure. We numerically investigated a THz waveguide with sharp bending and Mux/DeMux filters based on the oblique rectangular resonator of a bearded-type VPC waveguide.

ABSTRACT: Valley photonic crystals (VPCs) have provided a novel topological photonic platform to manipulate light. In this work, we construct zigzag and armchair domain walls using two-dimensional silicon VPCs, the edges between domains of opposite valley indices link to the corresponding topological invariant. We study the light transmission of these edges with defects and sharp bent corners. We design all-optical logic gates at telecommunication wavelength with both XOR and OR functions based on the valley-contrasting edges. Topologically protected waveguides own high transmission and backscattering-immune features, and the coupling process of different edge modes results in interference for logic functions. Compared with traditional photonic crystal logic gates, our device shows outstanding properties, including robust transmission, higher contrast ratio and more compact footprint. Furthermore, our work also shows the potential of topological photonics to be applied in optical logic circuits.

ABSTRACT: We propose simple and efficient way to control the propagation regime and direction of spoof surface plasmon-polaritons localized at bilayer hyperbolic metasurfaces. We demonstrate the photonic topological transition at the same frequency implemented with a mutual rotation of the metasurface layers. Finally, we show the tunable multidirectional in-plane canalization of surface waves adjusting by the interlayer coupling. These results discover new opportunities for the manipulation over surface waves at metasurfaces.

ABSTRACT: To reduce the influence of noise in infrared spectral signal measurement, a topological derivative improved partial differential equation method for infrared spectral data denoising is proposed. As an indicator function, topological derivative through a minimization process to find the best position to introduce disturbance, where are spectral edge points, then select the most excellent diffusion coefficient, so the cost of the minimum functional value. Based on the idea of topological optimization, it makes the lowest topological derivative to be optimum one. Then the diffusion is applied by using partial differential equation. Several simulated infrared spectral sequences are utilized to verify the performance of the proposed method. The experiment results show that our method is better in denoising.

ABSTRACT: Topology is an important degree of freedom in characterising electronic systems. Recently, it also brings new theoretical frontiers and many potential applications in photonics. However, the verification of the topological nature is highly nontrivial in photonic systems, as there is no direct analogue of quantised Hall conductance for bosonic photons. Here we propose a scheme of investigating topological photonics in superconducting quantum circuits by a simple parametric coupling method, the flexibility of which can lead to the effective in situ tunable artificial gauge field for photons on a square lattice. We further study the detection of the topological phases of the photons. Our idea uses the exotic properties of the edge state modes, which result in novel steady states of the lattice under the driving-dissipation competition. Through the pumping and the photon-number measurements of merely few sites, not only the spatial and the spectral characters but also the momentums and even the integer topological quantum numbers with arbitrary values of the edge state modes can be directly probed, which reveal unambiguously the topological nature of photons on the lattice.

ABSTRACT: A Dirac point is a linear band crossing point originally used to describe unusual transport properties of materials like graphene. In recent years, there has been a surge of exploration of type-II Dirac/Weyl points using various engineered platforms including photonic crystals, waveguide arrays, metasurfaces, magnetized plasma and polariton micropillars, aiming toward relativistic quantum emulation and understanding of exotic topological phenomena. Such endeavors, however, have focused mainly on linear topological states in real or synthetic Dirac/Weyl materials. We propose and demonstrate nonlinear valley Hall edge (VHE) states in laser-written anisotropic photonic lattices hosting innately the type-II Dirac points. These self-trapped VHE states, manifested as topological gap quasi-solitons that can move along a domain wall unidirectionally without changing their profiles, are independent of external magnetic fields or complex longitudinal modulations, and thus are superior in comparison with previously reported topological edge solitons. Our finding may provide a route for understanding nonlinear phenomena in systems with type-II Dirac points that violate the Lorentz invariance and may bring about possibilities for subsequent technological development in light field manipulation and photonic devices.

ABSTRACT: The quantum Zeno effect refers to the slowdown of the decay of a quantum system due to frequent measurements. It has been extended beyond quantum systems, manifesting itself in such phenomena as the suppression of output beam decay by sufficiently strong absorption introduced in guiding optical systems. In this case, the phenomenon is termed as macroscopic Zeno effect. Here the observation of the macroscopic Zeno effect in a topological photonic system is reported. The phenomenon is based on the suppression of decay for only a subspace of edge modes that can propagate in the system and does not rely on the existence of exceptional points. By introducing controlled losses in one of the arms of a topological insulator comprising two closely positioned Su-Schrieffer-Heeger arrays, the macroscopic Zeno effect is demonstrated, which manifests itself in an increase of the transparency of the system with respect to the topological modes created at the interface between two arrays. The phenomenon remains robust against disorder in the non-Hermitian topological regime. In contrast, coupling a topological array with a non-topological one results in a monotonic decrease in output power with increasing absorption. The macroscopic Zeno effect in a topological photonic system is demonstrated. It manifests itself as a counterintuitive increase of transmission in a topological edge state with an increase of the absorption in half of the structure. This effect strongly depends on the intricate topology of the system and remains robust against disorder, offering potential applications for light control in non-Hermitian systems. image

ABSTRACT: The low-decoberence regime plays a key role in constructing multi-particle quantum systems and has therefore been constantly pursued in order to build quantum simulators and quantum computers in a scalable fashion. Quantum error correction and quantum topological computing have been proved to be able to protect quantumness but have not yet been experimentally realized. Recently, topological boundary states are found to be inherently stable and are capable of protecting physical fields from dissipation and disorder, which inspires the application of such topological protection on quantum correlation. Here we present an experimental demonstration of topological protection of two-photon quantum states against the decoherence in diffusion on a photonic chip. By analyzing the quantum correlation of photons out from the topologically nontrivial boundary state, we obtain a high cross-correlation and a strong violation of Cauchy-Schwarz inequality up to 30 standard deviations. We further prepare different quantum sources and experimentally confirm that the topological protection is robust to the wavelength difference as well as distinguishability of two photons. Our results, together with our integrated implementation, provide an alternative way of protecting quantumness and may inspire many more explorations in quantum topological photonics, a crossover between topological photonics and quantum information.

ABSTRACT: The zero gap surface states of a 3D-topological insulator host highly mobile Dirac fermions with spin locked to the momentum. The high mobility attributed to the absence of back scattering is reduced in the presence of impurities on the surface. In particular, we discuss and compare scattering times for localised impurities on the surface, scattering between states of opposite helicity located on different surfaces coupled through a hybridisation potential and the role of magnetic impurities. Magnetic impurities give rise to an additional spin suppression factor. The role of warped bands and their influence on topological factors that can enhance the overall surface mobility is examined. Finally, employing a linearised Boltzmann equation approach, surface conductivity calculations for Dirac fermions in a 3D TI is outlined.

ABSTRACT: Although the spin-controlled vortex generation and photonic spin-Hall effect of spin-flipped abnormal mode have been widely studied recently, the traditional method based on the metasurface is difficult to fabricate, and the efficiency of the spin-flipped abnormal mode is rather low due to process errors and intrinsic material loss. Here, a new method is proposed based on the insights into the topological singularity and special Bragger reflections resonant (BRR) mode of one-dimensional (1D) finite photonic crystals (PhCs) with anisotropic material to realize nearly perfect (100%) spin-conversion efficiency. For a finite 1D PhC with cell number N, there are 3N complete spin-conversion (CSC) and complete spin-maintained (CSM) channels. Two mechanisms of these CSC and CSM channels are revealed. The working bandwidths and the angular ranges of these CSC and CSM are also studied. Based on these theoretical findings, multi-angles and multi-frequencies perfect spin-conversion (-maintained) devices can be designed. At last, these theoretical results are confirmed by the numerical experiments based on finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methods. This work paves the way to exploring the topological properties and polarization control of PhCs made of anisotropic dielectrics and provides a prospective method for the design of multi-channels spin optical devices. Multi-channels perfect spin-conversion and spin-maintaining are realized based on the topological singularity and Bragger reflections resonant mode of one-dimensional photonic crystals with anisotropic material. This work paves the way to exploring the topological properties and polarization control of photonic crystals made of anisotropic dielectrics and provides a prospective method to design a multi-channels spin optical device.image

ABSTRACT: The robust generation and propagation of multiphoton quantum states are crucial for applications in quantum information, computing, and communications. Although photons are intrinsically well isolated from the thermal environment, scaling to large quantum optical devices is still limited by scattering loss and other errors arising from random fabrication imperfections. The recent discoveries regarding topological phases have introduced avenues to construct quantum systems that are protected against scattering and imperfections. We experimentally demonstrate topological protection of biphoton states, the building block for quantum information systems. We provide clear evidence of the robustness of the spatial features and the propagation constant of biphoton states generated within a nanophotonics lattice with nontrivial topology and propose a concrete path to build robust entangled states for quantum gates.

ABSTRACT: "Recent progress in the Valley Hall insulator has demonstrated a nontrivial topology property due to the distinct valley index in 2D semiconductor systems. In this work, we propose a highly tunable topological phase transition based on valley photonic crystals. The topological phase transition is realized by the inversion symmetry broken due to the refractive index change of structures consisting of optical phase change material (OPCM) with thermal excitation of different sites in a honeycomb lattice structure. Besides, simulations of light propagation at sharp corners and pseudo-spin photon coupling are conducted to quantitatively examine the topological protection. Compared with other electro-optical materials based on reconfigurable topological photonics, a wider bandwidth and greater tunability of both central bandgap frequency and topological phase transition can happen in the proposed scheme. Our platform has great potential in practical applications in lasing, light sensing, and high-contrast tunable optical filters.& COPY  2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement"

ABSTRACT: Previous research processes on topological insulators were mainly based on the manual adjustment of a large number of fine parameters to achieve the desired properties. Here, we propose to treat the design process of photonic crystals as an objective function through topological optimization theory, allowing the desired properties to arise spontaneously with the optimization. Through topology optimization, we have designed and implemented three topological photonic crystals with different topological characteristics and dual-band protection common bandgap. The results show that functional edge modes with desired propagation properties can be generated within these two bandgaps by constructing domain walls between photonic crystal structures with different topological phases. The unidirectional transmission characteristics of the wave can also be observed, which provides an easy way to implement a wavelength division multiplexer.

ABSTRACT: The nontrivial and rigorous Heaviside phase jump behavior of phase singularities (PSs) empowers exotic topological modes and widely divergent nature compared to neighboring points, which has attracted great attention in condensed matter physics as well as applications in photonics and ultrasensitive sensors. Here we demonstrate the universal existence of a family of topologically protected PSs generated from exciton resonances of single-atom layers. We obtain the PSs by coating the transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) monolayers on a nonabsorptive semi-infinite substrate without surface plasmon effect or other assisted resonators, which exploits the benefits of both exciton-dominated enhancement and peculiarities of the singular phase. We show that a refractive indices matched transparent substrate enables TMDC monolayers to exhibit topologically protected zero reflection accompanied by a perfect Heaviside p-phase jump at strong light adsorptions, which can be utilized to radically reduce the thickness of PS-based devices to a single atomic layer. By using the TMDC monolayer-based PSs for refractive index biosensors, we demonstrate its superior phase sensitivity at a level of 10(4 )degrees per refractive index unit and detection of bioactive bacteria, respectively, which is comparable to the cutting-edge surface plasmon and Fabry-Perot resonance sensors. Our proof-of-concept results offer experimental and theoretical insights into a single atomic playground for flat singular optics and label-free biosensing technologies.

ABSTRACT: We report our design of a topological waveguide at the boundary of two adjacent magneto-optical photonic crystals with opposite magnetic biases which can simultaneously support symmetrical and anti-symmetrical topological edge states. In this non-reciprocal topological photonic model, the symmetrical and anti-symmetrical topological edge states possess the same direction of backscattering-immune chiral energy propagation. However, their directions of phase propagation are opposite, i.e., forward phase propagation for the symmetrical state while backward for the anti-symmetrical one. Using a finite-size structure, we can selectively couple one topological edge state to free space via oblique incidence to realize one-way transmission and reflection in a compact configuration. Furthermore, we design an all-photonic tunable splitter by hybridizing these two topological states. Based on manipulating the phase propagation of topological edge states, our work may offer promising applications in tunable topological photonics and extend the scope of topological photonics.

ABSTRACT: The control and enhancement of resonance energy transfer is highly desirable for a variety of applications ranging from solar cells to spectroscopic rulers. However, the process of direct resonance energy transfer is distance dependent and limited to similar to 10 nm for typical donor-acceptor pairs. Here we demonstrate long-range (similar to 160 nm) direct energy transfer between donor quantum dots and acceptor dye molecules through the use of an optical topological transition (OTT) in a metamaterial. The OTT in a metamaterial, modifies the density of states between the donor and acceptor, resulting in the long-range energy transfer with transfer efficiency of similar to 32%. Theoretical calculation based on master-equation formalism is used to model the system and is found to be in good agreement with the experimental observation. The use of OTTs in metamaterials to enhance and control energy transfer process can have wide array of potential applications ranging from organic solar cells to quantum entanglement.

ABSTRACT: We present a new method to measure the high-order topological charges (TCs) of Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) vortex beams by using a modified Mach-Zehnder interferometer. Counting the number of interference bright fringes between the LG beam and its conjugate beam determines integer and half-integer TCs through half of the bright fringe number. The proposed method can measure the order of the integer TC up to 90, which is higher than that achieved by previous methods. This technique opens up new applications for LG vortex beams.

ABSTRACT: Recently, the possibility of achieving one-way backscatter immune transportation of light by mimicking the topological properties of certain solid state systems, such as topological insulators, has received much attention. Thus far, however, demonstrations of nontrivial topology in photonics have relied on photonic crystals with precisely engineered lattice structures, periodic on the scale of the operational wavelength and composed of finely tuned, complex materials. Here we propose a novel effective medium approach towards achieving topologically protected photonic surface states robust against disorder on all length scales and for a wide range of material parameters. Remarkably, the nontrivial topology of our metamaterial design results from the Berry curvature arising from the transversality of electromagnetic waves in a homogeneous medium. Our investigation therefore acts to bridge the gap between the advancing field of topological band theory and classical optical phenomena such as the spin Hall effect of light. The effective medium route to topological phases will pave the way for highly compact one-way transportation of electromagnetic waves in integrated photonic circuits.

ABSTRACT: In crystals, two bands may cross each other and form degeneracies along a closed loop in the three-dimensional momentum space, which is called nodal line. Nodal line degeneracy can be designed to exhibit various configurations such as nodal rings, chains, links, and knots. Very recently, non-Abelian band topology was proposed in nodal link systems, where the nodal lines formed by consecutive pairs of bands exhibit interesting braiding structures and the underlying topological charges are described by quaternions. Here, we experimentally demonstrate non-Abelian nodal links in a biaxial hyperbolic metamaterial. The linked nodal lines threading through each other are formed by the crossings between three adjacent bands. Based on the non-Abelian charges, we further analyze various admissible nodal link configurations for the three-band system. On the interface between the metamaterial and air, surface bound states in the continuum are observed, which serves as the symmetry-enforced derivative of drumhead surface states from the linked nodal lines. Our work serves as a direct observation of the global topological structures of nodal links, and provides a platform for studying non-Abelian topological charge in the momentum space.

ABSTRACT: Chiral photonics deals with enantioselective polarization control of linear and nonlinear optical functions and holds a great promise for a wide range of applications including optical signal processing, biosensing and chiral bioimaging. Development of chiral materials with optical activity exceeding that of natural materials therefore becomes a prerequisite to,realizing the full potential of this field. Herein, we report on a study of structure-property relations of two chiral polymers with ester functional groups in lateral branch. To enhance rotational strength, the macroscopic measure of chirality, we employ a fluorene-quinoxaline motif in the monomer unit. To the best of our knowledge, we find the optical activity of one of the studied polymers to be the highest reported so far. Theoretical calculations reveal a correlation between the topological conformations and the simulated CD spectra in agreement with the experimental measurements and help clarify the mechanism of optical activity enhancement that could create insight for further enhancement of chirality.

ABSTRACT: Topological phases enable protected transport along the edges of materials, offering immunity against scattering from disorder and imperfections. These phases have been demonstrated for electronic systems, electromagnetic waves(1-5), cold atoms(6,7), acoustics(8) and even mechanics(9), and their potential applications include spintronics, quantum computing and highly efficient lasers(10-12). Typically, the model describing topological insulators is a spatial lattice in two or three dimensions. However, topological edge states have also been observed in a lattice with one spatial dimension and one synthetic dimension (corresponding to the spin modes of an ultracold atom(13-15)), and atomic modes have been used as synthetic dimensions to demonstrate lattice models and physical phenomena that are not accessible to experiments in spatial lattices(13,16,17). In photonics, topological lattices with synthetic dimensions have been proposed for the study of physical phenomena in high dimensions and interacting photons(18-22), but so far photonic topological insulators in synthetic dimensions have not been observed. Here we demonstrate experimentally a photonic topological insulator in synthetic dimensions. We fabricate a photonic lattice in which photons are subjected to an effective magnetic field in a space with one spatial dimension and one synthetic modal dimension. Our scheme supports topological edge states in this spatial-modal lattice, resulting in a robust topological state that extends over the bulk of a two-dimensional real-space lattice. Our system can be used to increase the dimensionality of a photonic lattice and induce long-range coupling by design, leading to lattice models that can be used to study unexplored physical phenomena.

ABSTRACT: Synthetic-space topological insulators are topological systems with at least one spatial dimension replaced by a periodic arrangement of modes, in the form of a ladder of energy levels, cavity modes, or some other sequence of modes. Such systems can significantly enrich the physics of topological insulators, in facilitating higher dimensions, nonlocal coupling, and more. Thus far, all synthetic-space topological insulators relied on active modulation to facilitate transport in the synthetic dimensions. Here, we propose dynamically invariant synthetic-space photonic topological insulators: a two-dimensional evolution-invariant photonic structure exhibiting topological properties in synthetic dimensions. This nonmagnetic structure is static, lacking any kind of modulation in the evolution coordinate, yet it displays an effective magnetic field in synthetic space, characterized by a Chem number of one. We study the evolution of topological states along the edge, and on the interface between two such structures with opposite synthetic-space chirality, and demonstrate their robust unidirectional propagation in the presence of defects and disorder. Such topological structures can be realized in photonics and cold atoms and provide a fundamentally new mechanism for topological insulators.

ABSTRACT: Topological phases have been explored in various fields in physics such as spintronics, photonics, liquid helium, correlated electron system, and cold-atomic system. This leads to the recent foundation of emerging materials such as topological band insulators, topological photonic crystals, and topological superconductors/superfluid. In this paper, we propose a topological magnonic crystal which provides protected chiral edge modes for magnetostatic spin waves. Based on a linearized Landau-Lifshitz equation, we show that a magnonic crystal with the dipolar interaction acquires a spin-wave volume-mode band with nonzero Chern integer. We argue that such magnonic systems are accompanied by the same integer numbers of chiral spin-wave edge modes within a band gap for the volume-mode bands. In these edge modes, the spin wave propagates in a unidirectional manner without being scattered backward, which implements novel fault-tolerant spintronic devices.

ABSTRACT: "Topological defects (TDs) manifest in many condensed matter systems. In liquid crystals (LCs), they occur as point or line singularities in the otherwise smooth director profile. Engineered and controllable TDs are of great interest for functional optoelectronic devices  however, the formation mechanism in patterned devices is not fully understood. In this work, electrically addressable TDs in doped mixtures of prototypical n-alkyl-cyanobiphenyl LCs 4-cyano-4 '-pentylbiphenyl (5CB) and 4-cyano-4 '-octylbiphenyl (8CB) are focused on. Doping concentrations of hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) are varied and the effect of varying the host LC properties (through binary 5CB:8CB mixtures) on defect formation is studied. In the results, a strong correlation between LC fluidity and the ease of defect array formation is presented, with 0.5 wt% CTAB-doped 5CB giving the best controllability/uniformity of TDs at low-threshold voltages. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the devices can be utilized as electrically switchable optical diffractive elements. In these findings, directions are mapped out that future studies can take in designing deterministic, electrically or magnetically tunable TD-based photonic devices using LC systems. Electrically induced, reconfigurable topological defect arrays can be generated in an ionic-doped liquid crystal medium. Time-varying electric fields applied to micropatterned devices induce electro-hydrodynamic instabilities that lead to ordered defect arrays with integer topological charge. The application of the devices as tunable, electrically addressable optical diffraction elements is demonstrated.image (c) 2023 WILEY-VCH GmbH"

ABSTRACT: We report on the generation of three types of bound states in a topological insulator-based mode-locked fiber laser. Benefiting from the excellent performance of the polyvinyl alcohol-based topological insulator saturable absorber (SA), we have achieved three types of bound solitons. The bound states exhibit different features both in spectra and autocorrelation traces, which was found to be caused by the different peak intensities and pulsewidths of two closed pulses within the bound states. The experimental phenomena were further confirmed by the numerical simulations. The results reveal an alternative method to roughly estimate the constructed solitons within bound states and indicate that the topological insulator could serve as a highly nonlinear SA for observing soliton dynamics in fiber lasers.

ABSTRACT: Visible wavelengths of light control the quantum matter of atoms and molecules and are foundational for quantum technologies, including computers, sensors, and clocks. The development of visible integrated photonics opens the possibility for scalable circuits with complex functionalities, advancing both science and technology frontiers. We experimentally demonstrate an inverse design approach based on the superposition of guided mode sources, allowing the generation and complete control of free-space radiation directly from within a single 150 nm layer Ta2O5, showing low loss across visible and near-infrared spectra. We generate diverging circularly polarized beams at the challenging 461 nm wavelength that can be directly used for magneto-optical traps of strontium atoms, constituting a fundamental building block for a range of atomic-physics-based quantum technologies. Our generated topological vortex beams and the potential for spatially varying polarization emitters could open unexplored light-matter interaction pathways, enabling a broad new photonic-atomic paradigm. Our platformhighlights the generalizability of nanoscale devices for visible-laser emission and will be critical for scaling quantum technologies.

ABSTRACT: Integrated photonic devices based on Si3N4 waveguides allow for the exploitation of nonlinear frequency conversion, exhibit low propagation loss, and have led to advances in compact atomic clocks, ultrafast ranging, and spectroscopy. Yet, the lack of Pockels effect presents a major challenge to achieve high-speed modulation of Si3N4. Here, microwave-frequency acousto-optic modulation is realized by exciting high-overtone bulk acoustic wave resonances (HBAR) in the photonic stack. Although HBAR is ubiquitously used in modern communication and superconducting circuits, this is the first time it has been incorporated on a photonic integrated chip. The tight vertical acoustic confinement releases the lateral design of freedom, and enables negligible cross-talk and preserving low optical loss. This hybrid HBAR nanophotonic platform can find immediate applications in topological photonics with synthetic dimensions, compact opto-electronic oscillators, and microwave-to-optical converters. As an application, a Si3N4-based optical isolator is demonstrated by spatiotemporal modulation, with over 17 dB isolation achieved. Here, the authors demonstrate acousto-optic modulation of silicon nitride microring resonators using high-overtone bulk acoustic wave resonances, allowing modulation in the GHz range via acoustic waves. As an application, an optical isolator is demonstrated with 17 dB non-reciprocity.

ABSTRACT: We theoretically demonstrate the realization of photonic topological insulators in photonic crystals made of circular cylinders with the Tellegen-type magnetoelectric coupling as a photospin-orbit interaction. Although the magnetoelectric coupling breaks the conventional (bosonic) time-reversal symmetry for photons, the electromagnetic duality between permittivity and permeability gives rise to a fermionic time-reversal symmetry. This symmetry along with the space-inversion symmetry enables us to imitate the Kane-Mele model of two-dimensional topological insulators in a photonics platform. Even if the space-inversion symmetry is broken, a photonic topological insulator can emerge owing to the photospin-orbit interaction. We present bulk and edge properties of the photonic topological insulators and discuss their possible realization.

ABSTRACT: Optical bound states in the continuum (BICs) have recently been realized in photonic crystal slabs, where the disappearance of out-of-plane radiation turns leaky resonances into guided modes with infinite lifetimes. We show that such BICs are vortex centers in the polarization directions of far-field radiation. They carry conserved and quantized topological charges, defined by the winding number of the polarization vectors, which ensure their robust existence and govern their generation, evolution, and annihilation. Our findings connect robust BICs in photonics to a wide range of topological physical phenomena.

ABSTRACT: Terahertz (THz) radiation is generally defined as the region of the electromagnetic spectrum in the range of 0.1 to 10 THz, between the millimeter and infrared frequencies. THz radiation is important from both scientific and application point of view. THz science and technology has been an active research area for a wide variety of applications: such as spectroscopy, imaging and sensing, biology and medical sciences, and security evaluation. The development of efficient, ultra-broadband, and low-cost THz photonic devices requires new materials and mechanisms, which is the key challenge for the field of THz science and technology. The discovery of THz electromagnetic pulse emission from ultrafast demagnetization by femtosecond laser pulses gave insight into the microscopic interactions that connect the ultrafast spintronics and the THz photonics. Based on our experimental observations, this paper reviews the recent developments and applications, the current understanding of the physical processes, and the perspectives of ultrafast spin-based THz photonics. Firstly, ultrashort THz pulses have been demonstrated as a promising tool to investigate the ultrafast spintronics. We review the fundamental physical processes and properties including THz-driven spin waves, THz spin transport probing, and ultrafast THz magnetometry. 1) The THz pulses are used to excite and control the antiferromagnetic spin waves in rare-earth orthoferrites with the THz time-domain spectroscopy. In addition, we observe the magnon-polariton, magnon-spin coupling, and magnon-magnon coupling in the condensed matter systems. 2) We demonstrate the magnetic modulation of THz waves, along with heat- and contact-free giant magnetoresistance, tunneling magnetoresistance and anisotropic magnetoresistance readout using ultrafast THz signals. We directly determine the spin-dependent densities and momentum scattering times of conduction electrons. The various magnetic configurations between the parallel state and antiparallel state of the magnetizations of the ferromagnetic layers in the magnetic tunnel junctions have the effect of changing the conductivity, making a functional modulation of the propagating THz electromagnetic fields. 3) We demonstrate a method of ultrafast THz magnetometry, which indicates the sub-picosecond demagnetization dynamics in a laser-excited iron film. The measurements reveal the contributions originating from magnetization quenching and acoustically-driven modulation of the exchange interaction. In addition, the ultrafast photoinduced spin transport can be extracted from the THz emission signals. We observe the transition of laser-induced THz spin currents from torque-mediated to conduction-electron-mediated transport in ferromagnetic/non-magnetic heterostructures. Secondly, by exploring the ultrafast THz spintronic effects, new applications in THz photonic devices emerge, including spintronic THz emitters, THz modulators and THz detectors. 1) The ferromagnetic/non-magnetic heterostructure under the excitation of femtosecond laser has proved to be a potential candidate for high-efficiency THz emission. The ultrafast spin-charge conversion based on the Inverse Spin Hall Effect (ISHE) is used to generate broadband THz radiation. We summarize the efforts that have been made to improve the performance of spintronics-based THz emitters. Up to date, the efficiency of spintronics-based THz emission has been enhanced to reach the same level of millimeter-thick ZnTe crystal. 2) The combined spintronic and photonic heterostructures are exploited to realize active modulation of THz radiation. In addition, it is demonstrated that the THz radiation can be mediated coherently through the charge current induced by the ISHE and the built-in transient current quasi-simultaneously created within the patterned heterostructures. 3) Using the ISHE, an antiferromagnet/heavy metal bilayer is theoretically promising for the realization of a resonant, compact, and tunable THz detector. In addition, a coherent and phase-locked coupling between a single-cycle THz transient and the magnetization of cobalt films suggests new opportunities for THz pulse detection. Finally, a brief summary and outlook are given. Looking to the future, we introduce the applications of ultrafast spin-based THz photonics, such as ultra-broadband measurements, magnetic structure detection and imaging, and THz near-field microscopy. In addition, topological materials bear a large potential for efficient spin-to-charge conversion due to the inherent spin-momentum locking. The topological insulator/ferromagnetic heterostructures are expected to present a high-performance THz radiation. In addition, the topological spintronic THz emitter will show a potential to generate arbitrary THz waveforms. One can anticipate that the research scope of ultrafast spin-based THz photonics will successfully be used to understand the fundamental physics in new materials and give rise to high-efficient THz photonic devices and spectroscopy applications. We hope that our work will stimulate more fundamental and technological developments in this new research field.

ABSTRACT: The optical properties of topological photonics have attracted much interest recently because its potential applications for robust unidirectional transmission that are immune to scattering at disorder. However, researches on topological series coupled ring resonators (T-SCRR) have been much less discussed. The existence of topological interface-states (TIS) in the T-SCRR is described for the first time in this article. An approach has been developed to achieve this goal via the band structure of dielectric binary ring resonators and the Zak phase of each bandgap. It is found that an ultra-high-Q with complete transmission is obtained by the conjugated topological series coupled ring resonators due to the excitation of conjugated topological interface-states, which is different from those in conventional TIS. Furthermore, the problem of transmission decreases resulting from high-Q increases in the traditional photonic system is significantly improved by this approach. These findings could pave a novel path for developing advanced high-Q filters, optical sensors, switches, resonators, communications and quantum information processors.

ABSTRACT: Topology has an increasingly important role in the physics of condensed matter, quantum systems, material science, photonics and biology, with spectacular realizations of topological concepts in liquid crystals. Here we report on long-lived hidden topological states in thermally quenched, chiral nematic droplets, formed from string-like, triangular and polyhedral constellations of monovalent and polyvalent singular point defects. These topological defects are regularly packed into a spherical liquid volume and stabilized by the elastic energy barrier due to the helical structure and confinement of the liquid crystal in the micro-sphere. We observe, for the first time, topological three-dimensional point defects of the quantized hedgehog charge q = -2, -3. These higher-charge defects act as ideal polyvalent artificial atoms, binding the defects into polyhedral constellations representing topological molecules.

ABSTRACT: The study of non-equilibrium properties in topological systems is of practical and fundamental importance. Here, we analyze the stationary properties of a two-dimensional bosonic Hofstadter lattice coupled to two thermal baths in the quantum open-system formalism. Novel phenomena appear like chiral edge heat currents that are the out-of-equilibrium counterparts of the zero-temperature edge currents. They support a new concept of dissipative symmetry-protection, where a set of discrete symmetries protects topological heat currents, differing from the symmetry-protection devised in closed systems and zero-temperature. Remarkably, one of these currents flows opposite to the decreasing external temperature gradient. As the starting point, we consider the case of a single external reservoir already showing prominent results like thermal erasure effects and topological thermal currents. Our results are experimentally accessible with platforms like photonics systems and optical lattices.

ABSTRACT: We propose a system that exploits the fundamental features of topological photonics and synthetic dimensions to force many semiconductor laser resonators to synchronize, mutually lock, and under suitable modulation emit a train of transform-limited mode-locked pulses. These lasers exploit the Floquet topological edge states in a 1D array of ring resonators, which corresponds to a 2D topological system with one spatial dimension and one synthetic frequency dimension. We show that the lasing state of the multielement laser system possesses the distinct characteristics of spatial topological edge states while exhibiting topologically protected transport. The topological synthetic-space edge mode imposes a constant-phase difference between the multifrequency modes on the edges, and together with modulation of the individual elements forces the ensemble of resonators to mode lock and emit short pulses, robust to disorder in the multiresonator system. Our results offer a proof-of-concept mechanism to actively mode lock a laser diode array of many lasing elements, which is otherwise extremely difficult due to the presence of many spatial modes of the array. The topological synthetic-space concepts proposed here offer an avenue to overcome this major technological challenge and open new opportunities in laser physics.

ABSTRACT: We propose a new method to trap sunlight in the active layer of thin-film solar cells. In this method, a photonic crystal, which realizes photonic topological insulators (PTI), is integrated inside the solar cell to trap sunlight in the active layer. PTIs with edge states in their boundaries, confine sunlight around their bulks and enhanced the absorption of the solar cell. The performance of the structure is investigated numerically using full-wave analysis. Numerical results show that the proposed method enhances the absorption of the solar cell in a wide range of wavelengths, as well as different angles of the incident light. The numerical calculations show that the short circuit current of the solar cell with PTI increases by 28 % in comparison with the simple solar cell.

ABSTRACT: In a number of theoretical (J. Opt. 6, 259 (2004)) and experimental (Opt Express 19, 5760 (2011)) works, an original fractional-TC optical vortex (with TC standing for topological charge) was shown to evolve into an integer optical vortex whose TC is equal to the nearest (i) smaller integer, if the fractional part is smaller than 1/2, and (ii) larger we show that the initial fractional optical vortex evolves into an integer optical vortex with TC equal to the nearest (i) smaller integer, if the fractional part is smaller than 0.12, and (ii) larger integer, if the fractional part is larger than 0.12. This can be explained by the fact that the additional center integer, if the fractional part is larger than 1/2. In this work, using numerical simulation, of singularity is generated on the beam periphery characterized by near zero-intensity (a millionth of the maximum), thus prohibiting the experimental detection, but allowing a numerical assessment.

ABSTRACT: Topological states of light open up exciting possibilities in quantum photonics, promising the topological protection of quantum entanglement. Here, we put forward an approach to realizing the topological states of photon pairs mediated by the effective density-dependent coupling, which is manifested as the dependence of the tunneling amplitude on the number of photons. As a specific platform, we investigate the arrays of nearest-neighbor coupled transmon qubits, where the effective density-dependent coupling is engineered by inserting auxiliary frequency-detuned resonators. We prove the topological origin of the designed model by the direct evaluation of the Zak phase, highlighting the feasibility of our proposal for state-of-the-art fabrication technologies.

ABSTRACT: Disordered systems play a central role in condensed matter physics, quantum transport, and topological photonics. It is commonly believed that a topological nontrivial phase would turn into a trivial phase where the transport vanishes under the effect of Anderson localization. Recent studies predict a counterintuitive result, that adding disorder to the trivial band structure triggers the emergence of protected edge states, the so-called topological Anderson phase. Here, we experimentally observe such a topological Anderson phase in a CMOS-compatible nanophotonic circuit, which implements the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model with incommensurate disorder in the intercell coupling amplitudes. The existence of the Anderson phase is verified by the spectral method, based on the continuous detection of the nanoscale light dynamics at the edge. Our results demonstrate the inverse transition between distinct topological phases in the presence of disorder, as well as offering a single-shot measurement technique to study the light dynamics in nanophotonic systems.

ABSTRACT: Maxwell electromagnetism, describing the wave properties of light, was formulated 150 years ago. More than 60 years ago it was shown that interfaces between optical media (including dielectrics, metals, negative-index materials) can support surface electromagnetic waves, which now play crucial roles in plasmonics, metamaterials, and nano-photonics. Here we show that surface Maxwell waves at interfaces between homogeneous isotropic media described by real permittivities and permeabilities have a topological origin explained by the bulk-boundary correspondence. Importantly, the topological classification is determined by the helicity operator, which is generically non-Hermitian even in lossless optical media. The corresponding topological invariant, which determines the number of surface modes, is a Z(4) number (or a pair of Z(2) numbers) describing the winding of the complex helicity spectrum across the interface. Our theory provides a new twist and insights for several areas of wave physics: Maxwell electromagnetism, topological quantum states, non-Hermitian wave physics, and metamaterials.

ABSTRACT: Time-reversal invariant topological insulator is widely recognized as one of the fundamental discoveries in condensed matter physics, for which the most fascinating hallmark is perhaps a spin-based topological protection, the absence of scattering of conduction electrons with certain spins on matter surface. Recently, it has created a paradigm shift for topological insulators, from electronics to photonics, phononics and mechanics as well, bringing about not only involved new physics but also potential applications in robust wave transport. Despite the growing interests in topologically protected acoustic wave transport, T-invariant acoustic topological insulator has not yet been achieved. Here we report experimental demonstration of anomalous Floquet topological insulator for sound: a strongly coupled metamaterial ring lattice that supports one-way propagation of pseudo-spin-dependent edge states under T-symmetry. We also demonstrate the formation of pseudo-spin-dependent interface states due to lattice dislocations and investigate the properties of pass band and band gap states.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics is rapidly expanding. However, discovering three-dimensional topological electromagnetic systems can be more challenging than electronic systems for two reasons. First, the vectorial nature of electromagnetic waves results in complicated band dispersions, and simple tight-binding-type predictions usually fail. Second, topological electromagnetic surface modes inside the light cone have very low quality factors (Q factors). Here, we propose the concept of scalar topological photonics to address these challenges. Our approach is experimentally validated by employing a nested meta-crystal configuration using connected coaxial waveguides. They exhibit scalar-wave-like band dispersions, making the search for photonic topological phases an easier task. Their surface states have skyrmion-like electric field distributions, resulting in a whole, bright surface state band inside the light cone continuum. As such, the topological surface states in our three-dimensional nested crystals can be exposed to air, making such systems well-suited for practical applications. Employing connected coaxial waveguides on a nested meta-crystal configuration, the authors design photonic crystals with scalar-wave-like band dispersions, facilitating the search for topological phases in three-dimensional photonic crystals.

ABSTRACT: Ultrafast lasers play an important role in a variety of applications ranging from optical communications to medical diagnostics and industrial materials processing. Graphene and other two-dimensional (2D) noncarbon materials, including topological insulators (TIs), transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), phosphorene, bismuthene, and antimonene, have witnessed a very fast development of both fundamental and practical aspects in ultrafast photonics since 2009. Their unique nonlinear optical properties enable them to be used as excellent saturable absorbers (SAs) that have fast responses and broadband operation, and can be easily integrated into lasers. Here, we catalog and review recent progress in the exploitation of these 2D noncarbon materials in this emerging field. The fabrication techniques, nonlinear optical properties, and device integration strategies of 2D noncarbon materials are first introduced with a comprehensive view. Then, various mode-locked/Q-switched lasers (e.g., fiber, solid-state, disk, and waveguide lasers) based on 2D noncarbon materials are reviewed. In addition, versatile soliton pulses generated from the mode-locked fiber lasers based on 2D noncarbon materials are also summarized. Finally, future challenges and perspectives of 2D materials-based lasers are addressed.

ABSTRACT: We provide a systematic study of non-Hermitian topologically charged systems. Starting from a Hermitian Hamiltonian supporting Weyl points with arbitrary topological charge, adding a non-Hermitian perturbation transforms the Weyl points to one-dimensional exceptional contours. We analytically prove that the topological charge is preserved on the exceptional contours. In contrast to Hermitian systems, the addition of gain and loss allows for a new class of topological phase transition: when two oppositely charged exceptional contours touch, the topological charge can dissipate without opening a gap. These effects can be demonstrated in realistic photonics and acoustics systems.

ABSTRACT: We propose a simple method, using the first singular value (FSV) of the spatial correlation of biphotons, to characterize topological phase transitions (TPTs) in one-dimensional (1D) topological photonic waveguide arrays (PWAs). After analyzing the spatial correlation of biphotons using the singular value decomposition, we found that the FSV of the spatial correlation of biphotons in real space can characterize TPTs and distinguish between the topological trivial and nontrivial phases in PWAs based on the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. The analytical simulation results were demonstrated by applying the coupled-mode theory to biphotons and were found to be in good agreement with those of the numerical simulation. Moreover, the numerical simulation of the FSV (of the spatial correlation of biphotons) successfully characterized the TPT in a PWA based on the Aubry-Andre-Har per and Rice-Mele models, demonstrating the universality of this method for 1D topological PWAs. Our method provides biphotons with the possibility of acquiring information regarding TPTs directly from the spatial correlation in real space, and their potential applications in quantum topological photonics and topological quantum computing as quantum simulators and information carriers.

ABSTRACT: Collective excitations at terahertz (THz) frequencies of thin films of Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te2.2Se0.8 topological insulators are investigated by a combination of hyperspectral nano-imaging and detectorless scattering-near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM). By mapping the THz near-field response, we provide first experimental evidence for the activation of bulk plasmons polaritons and hyperbolic phonon-polaritons coupled with the Dirac-plasmons associated with the topological surface-states. The unveiled low-loss, highly tunable and strongly confined terahertz electromagnetic modes prospect promising application in quantum nano-photonics.

ABSTRACT: Here, we study both theoretically and numerically a superposition of a Gaussian beam and a Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beam with zero radial index. Such field has several optical vortices (OV) that carry same-sign unity topological charge (TC) and are uniformly arranged on a circle. The circle with the OV centers can have arbitrary radius. We derive expressions to describe the orbital angular momentum (OAM) and topological charge (TC) of such field. It is known that, generally, the OAM of light a beam is not interconnected with the number of vortices (e.g. astigmatic beam does not contain any vortices but it has nonzero OAM). For the beam studied here though, it is shown that its OAM cannot exceed the number of vortices and decreases with increasing power of the Gaussian beam. On the contrary, the total TC is independent of this power, remaining equal to the number of constituent vortices. In addition to TC, other propagation-invariant quantities are constructed - we call them asymptotic phase invariants. These invariants are shown to be valid for a superposition of arbitrary number of LG beams or of Gaussian optical vortices. When propagated through a random phase screen (diffuser) or in free space, the multi-vortex beams can be identified using both the number of local intensity minima (shadow spots) and OAM with TC, which is verified via numerical simulation.

ABSTRACT: Unidirectional photonic edge states arise at the interface between two topologically distinct photonic crystals. Here, we demonstrate a micrometer-scale GaAs photonic ring resonator, created using a spin Hall-type topological photonic crystal waveguide. Embedded InGaAs quantum dots are used to probe the mode structure of the device. We map the spatial profile of the resonator modes and demonstrate the control of the mode confinement through tuning of the photonic crystal lattice parameters. The intrinsic chirality of the edge states makes them of interest for applications in integrated quantum photonics, and the resonator represents an important building block toward the development of such devices with embedded quantum emitters.

ABSTRACT: Chern-Simons theories have been very successful in explaining integer and fractional quantum Hall phases of matter, topological insulators, and Weyl semimetals. However, it remains an open question as to whether Chern-Simons theories can be adapted to topological photonics. We develop a viscous Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory to capture the fundamental physics of a topological electromagnetic phase of matter. We show the existence of a unique spin-1 skyrmion in the viscous Hall fluid arising from a photonic Zeeman interaction in momentum space. Our work bridges the gap between electromagnetic and condensed matter topological physics while also demonstrating the central role of photon spin-1 quantization in identifying new phases of matter.

ABSTRACT: Here we study theoretically and numerically a Gaussian beam with multiple optical vortices with unitary topological charge (TC) of the same sign, located uniformly on a circle. Simple expressions are obtained for the Gaussian beam power, its orbital angular momentum (OAM), and TC. We show that the OAM normalized to the beam power cannot exceed the number of vortices in the beam. This OAM decreases with increasing distance from the optical axis to the centers of the vortices. The topological charge, on the contrary, is independent of this distance and equals the number of vortices. The numerical simulation corroborates that after passing through a random phase screen (diffuser) and propagating in free space, the beams of interest can be identified by the number of local intensity minima (shadow spots) and by the OAM.

ABSTRACT: The Dirac semimetal cadmium arsenide (Cd3As2), a 3D electronic analog of graphene, has sparked renewed research interests for its novel topological phases and excellent optoelectronic properties. The gapless nature of its 3D electronic band facilitates strong optical nonlinearity and supports Dirac plasmons that are of particular interest to realize high-performance electronic and photonic devices at terahertz (1 THz = 4.1 meV) frequencies, where the performance of most dynamic materials are limited by the tradeoff between power-efficiency and switching speed. Here, all-optical, low-power, ultrafast broadband modulation of terahertz waves using an ultrathin film (100 nm, lambda/3000) of Cd3As2 are experimentally demonstrated through active tailoring of the photoconductivity. The measurements reveal the photosensitive metallic behavior of Cd3As2 with high terahertz electron mobility of 7200 cm(2) (Vs)(-1). In addition, optical fluence dependent ultrafast charge carrier relaxation (15.5 ps), terahertz mobility, and long momentum scattering time (157 fs) comparable to superconductors that invoke kinetic inductance at terahertz frequencies are demonstrated. These remarkable properties of 3D Dirac topological semimetal envision a new class of power-efficient, high speed, compact, tunable electronic, and photonic devices.

ABSTRACT: A high-sensitive refractive index sensor is proposed and demonstrated by utilizing merging bound states in the continuum, namely a set of integer topological charges in the momentum space. Through varying cladding refractive index n(c), the topological charges continuously depart from the merging state, and result in the robust and considerable high-Q factors (above 7 x 104) in a large detection range of 0.456. In such a range, sensing sensitivity of similar to 36 nm/RIU and figure-of-merit from similar to 5990 (air) to 1607 (n(c) = 1.456) are achieved. Meanwhile, the detection limit on the order of 10(-5) RIU is clearly distinguishable from the measured spectrum under tiny variation of cladding refractive index. Our work paves the way for promising integrated high-sensitive sensors in many biological and chemical applications.

ABSTRACT: In the processing of infrared small target image which has low signal-to-noise ratio and complex background, the target detection and recognition are very hard. So, how to suppress infrared complex background in low signal-to-clutter addition becomes the key problem in the detection of infrared small target image. The topological derivative can quantify the sensitivity of a problem when the domain under consideration is perturbed by changing its topology. Considering the idea of topology optimization, a modified topological derivative based background suppression method for infrared dim small target detection was proposed. An appropriate functional and variational problem is related to the cost function. Thus, the corresponding topological derivative can be used as an indicator function leads to the processed image through a minimization process. Firstly, introduce perturbations to each pixel of the infrared image. Secondly, calculate the corresponding topological derivative. These pixels also have the least cost function. Finally, using the modified optimal diffusion coefficient to diffuse the pixels where the topological derivative is negative to make its background smooth and achieve the purpose of removing the background clutter while enhancing the small target. Compared with other several experiment results of existing background suppressing methods in indexes, the method the paper proposed has innovative ideas and gets well effects of background suppressing and are practical methods. All of above have the important research value for the related work in future.

ABSTRACT: Up to now, Gaussian optical vortices (OVs) were investigated with the finite topological charge (TC). Here, we study an OV with the infinite TC. Such OVs have a countable number of phase singularities (isolated intensity nulls), which typically have the unitary TC and are located either equidistantly or not equidistantly on a straight line in the beam transverse cross section. Such OVs are structurally stable (form-invariant) and their transverse intensity is conserved on propagation, changing only in scale and rotation. Orbital angular momentum (OAM) of such OVs is finite, since only a finite number of screw dislocations are within the Gaussian beam in the area of notable intensity, whereas the other phase singularities are in the periphery (and in the infinity), where the intensity is very small. Increasing the Gaussian beam waist radius leads to the parabolic growth of the OAM of such beams. A unique feature of these beams is that their normalized OAM can be adjusted (both increased and decreased) by simple change of the waist radius of the Gaussian beam. In addition to the two form-invariant beams, we studied a Gaussian beam with a countable number of edge dislocations (zero-intensity lines), which is not form-invariant, but, after an astigmatic transform by a cylindrical lens, also becomes an infinite-topological-charge beam.

ABSTRACT: We experimentally demonstrate topological slow light waveguides in valley photonic crystals (VPhCs). We employed a bearded interface formed between two topologically-distinct VPhCs patterned in an air-bridged silicon slab. The interface supports both topological and non-topological slow light modes below the light line. By means of optical microscopy, we observed light propagation in the topological mode in the slow light regime with a group index n(g) over 30. Furthermore, we confirmed light transmission via the slow light mode even under the presence of sharp waveguide bends. In comparison between the topological and non-topological modes, we found that the topological mode exhibits much more efficient waveguiding than the trivial one, demonstrating topological protection in the slow light regime. This work paves the way for exploring topological slow-light devices compatible with existing photonics technologies.

ABSTRACT: Entangled multiphoton states lie at the heart of quantum information, computing, and communications. In recent years, topology has risen as a new avenue to robustly transport quantum states in the presence of fabrication defects, disorder, and other noise sources. Whereas topological protection of single photons and correlated photons has been recently demonstrated experimentally, the observation of topologically protected entangled states has thus far remained elusive. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the topological protection of spatially entangled biphoton states. We observe robustness in crucial features of the topological biphoton correlation map in the presence of deliberately introduced disorder in the silicon nanophotonic structure, in contrast with the lack of robustness in non-topological structures. The topological protection is shown to ensure the coherent propagation of the entangled topological modes, which may lead to robust propagation of quantum information in disordered systems.

ABSTRACT: After more than 10 years in development, the nonlinear topological photonics is emerging as a new branch of physics. One of the most interesting subjects in the nonlinear topological photonics are the topological edge solitons. These solitary structures move along the edges of photonic crystals with constant speed, are immune to disorders/defects along the way, and maintain their profiles unchanged during long-distance propagation. In this paper, we present bright and dark valley Hall edge solitons in the kagome photonic lattice. These solitons emerge at domain walls that exist between different types of kagome lattices. We are interested in the wall between two specific types: the squeezed and expanded kagome photonic lattices. The solitons move along the wall without change in their profiles, thanks to the self-action effect of nonlinearity, and can circumvent sharp corners, thanks to the topological protection. Advances achieved in this paper represent new progress in the nonlinear topological photonics and may lead to applications in the development of novel photonic chips.

ABSTRACT: This Review discusses the latest theoretical progress related to exceptional points in non-Hermitian physics and the associated implications for emerging technologies in nanophotonics. Exceptional points (EPs) arising in non-Hermitian systems have led to a variety of intriguing wave phenomena, and have been attracting increased interest in various physical platforms. In this Review, we highlight the latest fundamental advances in the context of EPs in various nanoscale systems, and overview the theoretical progress related to EPs, including higher-order EPs, bulk Fermi arcs and Weyl exceptional rings. We peek into EP-associated emerging technologies, in particular focusing on the influence of noise for sensing near EPs, improving the efficiency in asymmetric transmission based on EPs, optical isolators in nonlinear EP systems and novel concepts to implement EPs in topological photonics. We also discuss the constraints and limitations of the applications relying on EPs, and offer parting thoughts about promising ways to tackle them for advanced nanophotonic applications.

ABSTRACT: Here, we derive theoretically the topological charge (TC) of several vortex laser beams without the circular symmetry, namely asymmetric Laguerre-Gaussian (LG), asymmetric Bessel-Gaussian (BG), and asymmetric Kummer beams. Although such beams are obtained as superposition of respective conventional LG, BG, and Kummer beams, these beams have the same TC equal to that of a single mode, n. The induced asymmetry affects the normalized orbital angular momentum (OAM) of all these beams, and what is more, it affects the OAM of different beams differently. However, whatever the asymmetry degree, TC of the beams remains unchanged and equals n. Theoretical findings are validated via numerical simulation.

ABSTRACT: Topological rainbow concentrator based on synthetic dimensionality becomes an emerging topic as its bandwidth and operation frequency can be tuned by additional dimensions. Controlling geometric parameters and lattice translational parameters of the photonic crystal is usually designed by intuition and experience. In this letter, two deep neural networks are trained specially targeting at topological rainbow based on synthetic dimensionality. The first network is a tandem neural network that solves the non-uniqueness problem of inverse networks by being able to predict the geometric parameters of a photonic crystal with a given bandwidth as input, and another inverse network can predict the lattice translation translational parameter with geometric parameters and a given operation frequency, both of which can design the structure over 99% accuracy. Our results show that deep neural networks can quickly and accurately build topological rainbow concentrators with better results than linear modulation-based topological rainbow concentrators.

ABSTRACT: Electro-optic modulators are key components in data communication, microwave photonics, and quantum photonics. Modulation bandwidth, energy efficiency, and device dimension are crucial metrics of modulators. Here, we provide an important direction for the miniaturization of electro-optic modulators by reporting on ultracompact topological modulators. A topological interface state in a one-dimensional lattice is implemented on a thin-film lithium-niobate integrated platform. Due to the strong optical confinement of the interface state and the peaking enhancement of the electro-optic response, a topological cavity with a size of 1.6 x 140 mu m2 enables a large modulation bandwidth of 104 GHz. The first topological modulator exhibits the most compact device size compared to reported LN modulators with bandwidths above 28 GHz, to the best of our knowledge. 100 Gb/s non-return-to-zero and 100 Gb/s four-level pulse amplitude modulation signals are generated. The switching energy is 5.4 fJ/bit, owing to the small electro-optic mode volume and low capacitance. The topological modulator accelerates the response time of topological photonic devices from the microsecond order to the picosecond order and provides an essential foundation for the implementation of large-scale lithium-niobate photonic integrated circuits.

ABSTRACT: Valley polarization has recently been adopted in optics, offering robust waveguiding and angular momentum sorting. The success of valley systems in photonic crystals suggests a plasmonic counterpart that can merge topological photonics and topological condensed matter systems, for instance, two-dimensional materials with the enhanced light-matter interaction. However, a valley plasmonic waveguide with a sufficient propagation distance in the near-infrared (NIR) or visible spectral range has so far not been realized due to ohmic loss inside the metal. Here, we employ gap surface plasmons for high index contrasting and realize a wide-bandgap valley plasmonic crystal, allowing waveguiding in the NIR-visible range. The edge mode with a propagation distance of 5.3 mu m in the range of 1.31-1.36 eV is experimentally confirmed by visualizing the field distributions with a scanning transmission electron microscope cathodoluminescence technique, suggesting a practical platform for transferring angular momentum between photons and carriers in mesoscopic active devices.

ABSTRACT: Conventional Q-switched mid-infrared fiber lasers normally rely on bulk optical elements for assembling mid infrared resonators, which will possibly undermine the reliability and robustness of the fiber laser systems. Here, we address the challenge through demonstrating, for the first time, a miniaturized 3 tm Ho3+:ZBLAN fiber laser passively Q-switched by topological insulator Bi2Se3. The linear all-fiber cavity simply consists of a home-made 1153 nm fiber laser as pump source, a 2m Ho3 :ZBLAN fiber, and two fiber end-facet mirrors. By inserting the few-layer Bi2Se3 saturable absorber into the laser cavity, stable mid-infrared Q-switched pulses at 2920.6 nm were generated at a low threshold of 70 mW, and the pulse repetition rate can be linearly tuned from 24.97 to 56.13 kHz. The maximum average power obtained was 315 uW, corresponding to the narrowest pulse duration of 1.54 is and the maximum pulse energy of 6 nJ, relatively.

ABSTRACT: In various subdisciplines of optics and photonics, Mie theory has been serving as a fundamental language and playing indispensable roles widely. Conventional studies related to Mie scattering largely focus on local properties such as differential cross sections and angular polarization distributions. Though spatially integrated features of total cross sections in terms of both scattering and absorption are routine for investigations, they are intrinsically dependent on the specific morphologies of both the scattering bodies and the incident waves, consequently manifesting no sign of global invariance. Here, we propose a global Mie scattering theory to explore topological invariants for the characterization of scatterings by any obstacles of arbitrarily structured or polarized coherent light. It is revealed that, independent of distributions and interactions among the scattering bodies of arbitrary geometric and optical parameters, in the far field, inevitably, there are directions where the scatterings are either zero or circularly polarized. Furthermore, for each such singular direction, we can assign a half-integer index and the index sum of all those directions are bounded to be a global topological invariant of 2. The global Mie theory we propose, which is mathematically simple but conceptually penetrating, can render new perspectives for light scattering and topological photonics in both linear and nonlinear regimes and would potentially shed new light on the scattering of acoustic and matter waves of various forms.

ABSTRACT: Quantum cascade lasers are compact, electrically pumped light sources in the technologically important mid-infrared and terahertz region of the electromagnetic spectrum(1,2). Recently, the concept of topology(3) has been expanded from condensed matter physics into photonics(4), giving rise to a new type of lasing(5-8) using topologically protected photonic modes that can efficiently bypass corners and defects(4). Previous demonstrations of topological lasers have required an external laser source for optical pumping and have operated in the conventional optical frequency regime(5-8). Here we demonstrate an electrically pumped terahertz quantum cascade laser based on topologically protected valley edge states(9-11). Unlike topological lasers that rely on large-scale features to impart topological protection, our compact design makes use of the valley degree of freedom in photonic crystals(10,11), analogous to two-dimensional gapped valleytronic materials(12). Lasing with regularly spaced emission peaks occurs in a sharp-cornered triangular cavity, even if perturbations are introduced into the underlying structure, owing to the existence of topologically protected valley edge states that circulate around the cavity without experiencing localization. We probe the properties of the topological lasing modes by adding different outcouplers to the topological cavity. The laser based on valley edge states may open routes to the practical use of topological protection in electrically driven laser sources.

ABSTRACT: Realizing photonic analogs of the robust, unidirectional edge states of electronic topological insulators would improve our control of light on the nanoscale and revolutionize the performance of photonic devices. Here, we show that new symmetry-protected topological phases can be detected by reformulating energy eigenproblems as Berry curvature eigenproblems. The Berry bands span the same eigenspace as the original valence energy bands, but separate into pseudo-spinful and pseudo-spinless subspaces in C2T-symmetric crystals. We demonstrate the method on the well-known case of Wu and Hu [Phys. Rev. Lett 114, 223901 (2015)] and a recently discovered fragilely topological crystal, and show that both crystals belong to the same photonic analog of the quantum spin-Hall effect. This work helps unite theory and numerics, and is useful in defining and identifying new symmetry-protected phases in photonics and electronics.

ABSTRACT: Topological on-chip photonics based on tailored photonic crystals (PhCs) that emulate quantum valley-Hall effects has recently gained widespread interest owing to its promise of robust unidirectional transport of classical and quantum information. We present a direct quantitative evaluation of topological photonic edge eigenstates and their transport properties in the telecom wavelength range using phase-resolved near-field optical microscopy. Experimentally visualizing the detailed sub-wavelength structure of these modes propagating along the interface between two topologically non-trivial mirror-symmetric lattices allows us to map their dispersion relation and differentiate between the contributions of several higher-order Bloch harmonics. Selective probing of forward- and backward-propagating modes as defined by their phase velocities enables direct quantification of topological robustness. Studying near-field propagation in controlled defects allows us to extract upper limits of topological protection in on-chip photonic systems in comparison with conventional PhC waveguides. We find that protected edge states are two orders of magnitude more robust than modes of conventional PhC waveguides. This direct experimental quantification of topological robustness comprises a crucial step toward the application of topologically protected guiding in integrated photonics, allowing for unprecedented error-free photonic quantum networks.

ABSTRACT: Network-forming cluster approach is applied to As-Se and Ge-Se glasses to justify their tendency to self-organization. It is shown that reversibility windows determined by temperature-modulated differential scanning calorimetry using short-term aged or as-prepared samples do not necessary coincide with self-organized phase in these materials. The obtained results testify also pseudo-self-organization phenomenon in Ge-Se glasses: over-constrained outrigger raft structural units built of two edge- and four corner-shared tetrahedra are interconnected via optimally-constrained Ge-Se-Se-Ge bridges within the range of compositions identified previously as self-organized phase by temperature modulated differential scanning calorimetry technique.

ABSTRACT: Dirac semimetals are topological materials with degenerated Dirac points in their band structures. In particular, the Dirac points play a central role in the topologically protected phases. Recently, it was reported that the peculiar type-II Dirac points could be realized in photonics by means of photonic crystals (PCs). Nevertheless, the practical implementation is rather challenging. In this paper, we demonstrate that the nonlocal effect in the interior of a homogeneous photonic metamaterial (HPM) enables the existence of type-II Dirac points in the HPM's band structure. With theoretical formulations and numerical evaluations, we discuss the evolution of the HPM's band type and present the interesting transition between type-I and type-II Dirac degeneracy of the HPMs. Remarkably, a pair of the type-II Dirac points can be generated at two different frequencies, which is supported by the mode overlapping in the HPMs with weak nonlocality. The Fermi arc surface states connect the projections of the type-II Dirac points at the boundary between the vacuum and HPMs. The topological protection of the Fermi arc surface states is verified by the reflectionless transmission with sharp corners. Our paper provides a fundamental understanding of topological photonics by type-II Dirac points in HPMs.

ABSTRACT: Higher-order topological insulators, as newly found non-trivial materials and structures, possess topological phases beyond the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence. In previous studies, in-gap boundary states such as the corner states were regarded as conclusive evidence for the emergence of higher-order topological insulators. Here, we present an experimental observation of a photonic higher-order topological insulator with corner states embedded into the bulk spectrum, denoted as the higher-order topological bound states in the continuum. Especially, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a new way to identify topological corner states by exciting them separately from the bulk states with photonic quantum superposition states. Our results extend the topological bound states in the continuum into higher-order cases, providing an unprecedented mechanism to achieve robust and localized states in a bulk spectrum. More importantly, our experiments exhibit the advantage of using the time evolution of quantum superposition states to identify topological corner modes, which may shed light on future exploration between quantum dynamics and higher-order topological photonics.

ABSTRACT: Chiral nanophotonic components, such as waveguides and resonators coupled to quantum emitters, provide a fundamentally new approach to manipulate light-matter interactions. The recent emergence of topological photonics has provided a new paradigm to realize helical/chiral nanophotonic structures that are flexible in design and, at the same time, robust against sharp bends and disorder. Here we demonstrate such a topologically protected chiral nanophotonic resonator that is strongly coupled to a solid-state quantum emitter. Specifically, we employ the valley-Hall effect in a photonic crystal to achieve topological edge states at an interface between two topologically distinct regions. Our helical resonator supports two counterpropagating edge modes with opposite polarizations. We first show chiral coupling between the topological resonator and the quantum emitter such that the emitter emits preferably into one of the counterpropagating edge modes depending upon its spin. Subsequently, we demonstrate strong coupling between the resonator and the quantum emitter using resonant Purcell enhancement in the emission intensity by a factor of 3.4. Such chiral resonators could enable designing complex nanophotonic circuits for quantum information processing and studying novel quantum many-body dynamics.

ABSTRACT: Here, we investigate coaxial superpositions of Gaussian optical vortices that can be described by a geometric sequence. For all superpositions analyzed, a topological charge (TC) is derived. In the initial plane, the TC can be either integer or half-integer, acquiring an integer value upon freespace propagation of the light field. Generally, the geometric sequence of optical vortices (GSOV) has three integer parameters and one real parameter. Values of these four parameters define the TC of the GSOV. Upon free-space propagation, the intensity pattern of the GSOV is not conserved, but can have intensity petals whose number is equal to one of the four beam parameters. If the GSOV has a unit real parameter, all constituent angular harmonics in the superposition have the same weight. In this case, the TC of the superposition is equal to the average index of the constituent angular harmonics. For instance, if the TC of the first and of the last angular harmonics, respectively, equals k and n, then the total TC of the superposition in the initial plane will be (n + k) /2, becoming equal to n upon free-space propagation.

ABSTRACT: We theoretically study the topological optical properties in one-dimensional zigzag chains composed of metal nanoparticles. The topological phase transition in the system is realized by controlling the polarization of the external optical field, which is feasible in experiments in contrast with changing the structural parameters. The dipole responses of the system with different bond angles to the external field of arbitrary linear polarization are calculated. It is found that a wide domain of polarization angles is available for a given zigzag chain to observe the polarization-induced topological transition. Different topological phases in the system are checked, which further proves the effectiveness of polarization modulation. The system, an easily implemented platform to study phenomena in topological photonics, might have novel applications in nanoscale optical devices.

ABSTRACT: Photonics can be confined in real space with dispersion vanishing in the momentum space due to destructive interference. In this Letter, we report the experimental realization of flat bands with nontrivial topology in a self-complementary plasmonic metasurface. The band diagram and compact localized states are measured. In these nontrivial band gaps, we observe the topological edge states by near-field measurements. Furthermore, we propose a digitalized metasurface by loading controllable diodes with C3 symmetry in every unit cell. By pumping a digital signal into the metasurface, we investigate the interaction between incident waves and the dynamic metasurface. Experimental results indicate that compact localized states in the nontrivial flat band could enhance the wave-matter interactions to convert more incident waves to time-modulated harmonic photonics. Although our experiments are conducted in the microwave regime, extending the related concepts into the optical plasmonic systems is feasible. Our findings pave an avenue toward planar integrated photonic devices with nontrivial flat bands and exotic transmission phenomena.

ABSTRACT: The great potential of Dirac electrons for plasmonics and photonics has been readily recognized after their discovery in graphene, followed by applications to smart optical devices. Dirac carriers are also found in topological insulators (TIs)-quantum systems having an insulating gap in the bulk and intrinsic Dirac metallic states at the surface. Here, the plasmonic response of ring structures patterned in Bi2Se3 TI films is investigated through terahertz (THz) spectroscopy. The rings are observed to exhibit a bonding and an antibonding plasmon modes, which we tune in frequency by varying their diameter. An analytical theory based on the THz conductance of unpatterned films is developed, which accurately describes the strong plasmon-phonon hybridization and Fano interference experimentally observed as the bonding plasmon is swiped across the prominent 2 THz phonon exhibited by this material. This work opens the road for the investigation of plasmons in topological insulators and for their application in tunable THz devices.

ABSTRACT: Modern technological advances allow for the study of systems with additional synthetic dimensions. Higher-order topological insulators in topological states of matters have been pursued in lower physical dimensions by exploiting synthetic dimensions with phase transitions. While synthetic dimensions can be rendered in the photonics and cold atomic gases, little to no work has been succeeded in acoustics because acoustic wave-guides cannot be weakly coupled in a continuous fashion. Here, we formulate the theoretical principles and manufacture acoustic crystals composed of arrays of acoustic cavities strongly coupled through modulated channels to evidence one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) dynamic topological pumpings. In particular, the higher-order topological edge-bulk-edge and corner-bulk-corner transport are physically illustrated in finite-sized acoustic structures. We delineate the generated 2D and four-dimensional (4D) quantum Hall effects by calculating first and second Chern numbers and physically demonstrate robustness against the geometrical imperfections. Synthetic dimensions could provide a powerful way for acoustic topological wave steering and open up a platform to explore any continuous orbit in higher-order topological matter in dimensions four and higher. The authors create synthetic dimensions in acoustic crystals composed of cavity arrays, strongly coupled through modulated channels. They provide evidence for 1D and 2D dynamic topological pumping, and show that the higher-order topological sound transport is robust against the geometrical imperfections.

ABSTRACT: Non-Hermitian topological photonics possesses abundant and complicated physical effects and phenomena, which have great potential and important applications in integrated photonic devices. However, the light localization properties and approaches for active control of topological states have not been revealed sufficiently so far. Here we prove the phase transition exists in the interface between gain and loss domains of a parity-time symmetric C6v topological photonic crystal from its projected bands. The non-Hermitian topological cavity formed by closed gain-loss boundary has unique resonant responses and better light localization properties compared with the Hermitian counterpart. The cavity modes are composed of edge states and corner states whose eigenfrequencies change with gain-loss quantity in the same way as the projected band. The maximum value of the quality factor of non-Hermitian topological cavity reaches 104, which is enlarged by one order compared with the Hermitian counterpart. At the same time, the mode volume of non-Hermitian topological cavity is reduced by over tenfold compared with the Hermitian counterpart. The non-Hermitian induced edge states and corner states may open a new route for the design of the topologically protected and reconfigurable localized resonances. This work provides a new degree of freedom to control different topological states and offers a scheme for solving the contradiction between the flexibility of devices and the robustness of topological properties.

ABSTRACT: Assessing the nature of topological quantum materials, and in particular probing the existence of topological surface states, is a very challenging task. Terahertz (THz) frequency scattering near-field optical microscopy has emerged as an effective technique to investigate the presence of massless surface carriers by locally probing collective surface excitations, i.e., plasmon polaritons, whose dispersion critically depends on the density and nature of surface carriers. Here, thin (14-19 nm) films of Bi2Se3 are experimentally investigated through a combination of x-ray diffraction, Hall-bar magneto-transport, and near-field detectorless optical holography at THz frequencies, from 2 to 4.3 THz. The dispersion of surface plasmon polaritons are determined for different Bi2Se3 film thicknesses, proving the presence of massless surface carriers. The results open intriguing opportunities in THz nano-plasmonics and topological nano-photonics including the development of superlenses and metasurfaces, making use of plasmon polaritons.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics has recently emerged as a very general framework for the design of unidirectional edge waveguides immune to backscattering and deformations, as well as other platforms that feature extreme nonreciprocal wave phenomena. While the topological classification of time-invariant crystals has been widely discussed in the literature, the study of spacetime crystals formed by time-variant materials remains largely unexplored. Here, we extend the methods of topological band theory to photonic crystals formed by inclusions that are subject to a spacetime rotating-wave modulation that imitates a physical rotating motion. By resorting to an approximate nonhomogeneous effective description of the electromagnetic response of the inclusions, it is shown that they possess a bianisotropic response that breaks the time-reversal symmetry and may give rise to nontrivial topologies. In particular, we propose an implementation of the Haldane model in a spacetime modulated photonic crystal.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics offers the possibility of robust transport and efficiency enhancement of information processing. Terahertz (THz) devices, such as waveguides and beam splitters, are prone to reflection loss owing to their sensitivity to defects and lack of robustness against sharp corners. Thus, it is a challenge to reduce backscattering loss at THz frequencies. In this work, we constructed THz photonic topological insulators and experimentally demonstrated robust, topologically protected valley transport in THz photonic crystals. The THz valley photonic crystal (VPC) was composed of metallic cylinders situated in a triangular lattice. By tuning the relevant location of metallic cylinders in the unit cell, mirror symmetry was broken, and the degenerated states were lifted at the K and K' valleys in the band structure. Consequently, a bandgap of THz VPC was opened, and a nontrivial band structure was created. Based on the calculated band structure, THz field distributions, and valley Berry curvature, we verified the topological phase transition in such type of THz photonic crystals. Further, we showed the emergence of valley-polarized topological edge states between the topologically distinct VPCs. The angle-resolved transmittance measurements identified the bulk bandgap in the band structure of the VPC. The measured time-domain spectra demonstrated the topological transport of valley edge states between distinct VPCs and their robustness against bending and defects. Furthermore, experiments conducted on a topological multi-channel intersectional device revealed the valley-polarized characteristic of the topological edge states. This work provides a unique approach to reduce backscattering loss at the THz regime. It also demonstrates potential high-efficiency THz functional devices such as topologically protected beam splitters, low-loss waveguides, and robust delay lines.

ABSTRACT: Topological insulators host protected electronic states at their surface. These states show little sensitivity to disorder. For miniaturization one wants to exploit their robustness at the smallest sizes possible. This is also beneficial for optical applications and catalysis, which favor large surface-to-volume ratios. However, it is not known whether discrete states in particles share the protection of their continuous counterparts in large crystals. Here we study the protection of the states hosted by topological insulator nanoparticles. Using both analytical and tight-binding simulations, we show that the states benefit from the same level of protection as those on a planar surface. The results hold for many shapes and sustain surface roughness which may be useful in photonics, spectroscopy, and chemistry. They complement past studies of large crystals-at the other end of possible length scales. The protection of the nanoparticles suggests that samples of all intermediate sizes also possess protected states.

ABSTRACT: The topological corner state (TCS) and topological edge state (TES) have created new approaches to manipulate the propagation of light. The construction of a topological coupled cavity-waveguide (TCCW) based on the TCS and TES is worth looking forward to, due to its research prospects in realizing high-performance micro-nano integrated photonic devices. In this Letter, the TCCW is proposed in two-dimensional (2D) photonic crystal (PC), which possesses strong optical localization, high quality factor, and excellent robustness compared with the conventional coupled cavity-waveguide (CCCW). This work will pave the way toward designing high-performance logic gates, lasers, filters, and other micro-nano integrated photonics devices and expanding their applications.

ABSTRACT: An optical vortex passed through an arbitrary aperture (with the vortex center found within the aperture) or shifted from the optical axis of an arbitrary axisymmetric carrier beam is shown to conserve the integer topological charge (TC). If the beam contains a finite number of off-axis optical vortices with different TCs of the same sign, the resulting TC of the beam is shown to be equal to the sum of all constituent TCs. For a coaxial superposition of a finite number of the Laguerre-Gaussian modes (n, 0), the resulting TC equals that of the mode with the highest TC (including sign). If the highest positive and negative TCs of the constituent modes are equal in magnitude, then TC of the superposition is equal to that of the mode with the larger (in absolute value) weight coefficient. If both weight coefficients are the same, the resulting TC equals zero. For a coaxial superposition of two different-amplitude Gaussian vortices, the resulting TC equals that of the constituent vortex with the larger absolute value of the weight coefficient amplitude, irrespective of the relation between the individual TCs.

ABSTRACT: In analogy to Lifshitz transitions in electronic systems, topological transitions have recently attracted widespread attention in photonic metamaterials, metasurfaces, and two-dimensional materials, enabling exotic regimes for light-matter interactions. Here, we discuss and study enhanced photonic local density of states in twisted hyperbolic bilayers, enabled by topological transitions emerging at specific twist angles. Our results enhance the understanding of nanoscale light-matter interactions in stacked optical materials as they are rotated with respect to each other in the context of twistronics and suggest emerging applications of these concepts for photonics, including for the manipulation of radiative heat transfer and the control and harvesting of light at the nanoscale.

ABSTRACT: Recently optical beams containing orbital angular momentum have gained considerable attention due to their wide range of uses. In all the applications, accurate determination of the magnitude and sign of the topological charge (TC) is very important. Different techniques for determining the vortex beam's TC have been reported such as interferometric, diffractive, and machine learning based methods. In this letter, we demonstrate a novel technique to identify the TC of a vortex beam using the optical correlation method where a maximum average correlation height filter has been used. Unlike conventional methods, the proposed method enables instant identification of TC without manually counting the number of fringes and requires lesser datasets with simple architecture as compared to the machine learning-based method. The proposed idea is verified through both numerical simulation and experimental results with the help of fork-shaped interferometry.

ABSTRACT: We present Floquet fractal topological insulators: photonic topological insulators in a fractal-dimensional lattice consisting of helical waveguides. The helical modulation induces an artificial gauge field and leads to a trivial-to-topological phase transition. The quasi-energy spectrum shows the existence of topological edge states corresponding to real-space Chern number 1. We study the propagation of light along the outer edges of the fractal lattice and find that wavepackets move along the edges without penetrating into the bulk or backscattering even in the presence of disorder. In a similar vein, we find that the inner edges of the fractal lattice also exhibit robust transport when the fractal is of sufficiently high generation. Finally, we find topological edge states that span the circumference of a hybrid half-fractal, half-honeycomb lattice, passing from the edge of the honeycomb lattice to the edge of the fractal structure virtually without scattering, despite the transition from two dimensions to a fractal dimension. Our system offers a realizable experimental platform to study topological fractals and provides new directions for exploring topological physics. Light: science and applications topological photonics: fractal latticesPhotonic topological insulators are currently a subject of great interest because they support edge states that can propagate without being affected by defects and disorder. All topological insulators discovered thus far have a bulk surrounded by edges. Now, Zhaoju Yang and coworkers from Technion in Israel, found theoretically that photonic topological insulators can also exist in fractal lattices, comprising only edges-with no bulk at all. They studied fractal lattices structured as Sierpinski gasket composed of an array of evanescently coupled helical waveguides. Despite the lack periodicity in such structures, tight-binding simulations and quasienergy analysis predict the existence of topological edge states, residing either on outer or on inner edges, exhibiting a Chern number of 1 and displaying scattering-free propagation. The fractal symmetries of such lattices are found to be crucial for the existence of the topological properties. Such fractal lattices could be fabricated by femtosecond laser writing technology.

ABSTRACT: We study the role of topological edge states of light in the transport of thermally generated radiation in a closed cavity at a thermodynamic equilibrium. It is shown that even in the zero temperature limit-when the field fluctuations are purely quantum mechanical-there is a persistent flow of electromagnetic momentum in the cavity in closed orbits, deeply rooted in the emergence of spatially separated unidirectional edge state channels. It is highlighted that the electromagnetic orbital angular momentum of the system is nontrivial, and that the energy circulation is towards the same direction as that determined by incomplete cyclotron orbits near the cavity walls. Our findings open inroads in topological photonics and suggest that topological states of light can determine novel paradigms in the context of radiative heat transport.

ABSTRACT: The combination of nonlinearity and topology has recently attracted significant attention in the field of optical physics. This work considers a photonic Chern insulator in the nonlinear regime and explores the properties of topological bulk solitons holding the stability and robustness, which contributes to the field of nonlinear topological photonics and provides further physical understandings towards other photonic topological insulators with nonlinearity. Nonlinearities in lattices with topological band structures can induce topological interfaces in the bulk of structures and give rise to bulk solitons in the topological bandgaps. Here we study a photonic Chern insulator with saturable nonlinearity and show the existence of topological bulk solitons. The fundamental bulk solitons exhibit as semi-vortex solitons, where only one pseudospin component has a nonzero vorticity. The bulk solitons have equal angular momentum at different valleys. This phenomenon is a direct outcome of the topology of the linear host lattice and the angular momentum can be changed by switching the sign of the nonlinearity. The bulk solitons bifurcate from the linear bulk band edge and terminate when their powers saturate. We find that these bulk solitons are stable within the whole spectrum range. Moreover, these bulk solitons are robust against lattice disorders both from on-site energies and hopping amplitudes. Our work extends the study of Chern insulators into the nonlinear regime and highlights the interplay between topology and nonlinearity.

ABSTRACT: A salient feature of solid-state quantum-Hall-type topological materials in two dimensions is the presence of conducting electronic edge states that are insensitive to scattering by disorder. Such unidirectional edge states have been predicted and observed in many other experimental settings, including photonics, mechanical, and acoustic structures. It is of great interest to understand how topological states behave in the presence of interparticle interactions and nonlinearity. Here, we experimentally demonstrate backscatter-immune unidirectional solitonlike nonlinear states on the edge of photonic topological insulators consisting of laser-written waveguides. As a result of the optical Kerr nonlinearity of the ambient glass, the solitonlike wave packet forms a long-lived quasilocalized coherent structure that slowly radiates power into the bulk and along the edge. The realization of solitonlike edge states paves the way to an understanding of nonlinear and interacting topological systems.

ABSTRACT: The study of topological phases of light underpins a promising paradigm for engineering disorder-immune compact photonic devices with unusual properties. Combined with an optical gain, topological photonic structures provide a novel platform for micro- and nanoscale lasers, which could benefit from nontrivial band topology and spatially localized gap states. Here, we propose and demonstrate experimentally active nanophotonic topological cavities incorporating III-V semiconductor quantum wells as a gain medium in the structure. We observe room-temperature lasing with a narrow spectrum, high coherence, and threshold behaviour. The emitted beam hosts a singularity encoded by a triade cavity mode that resides in the bandgap of two interfaced valley-Hall periodic photonic lattices with opposite parity breaking. Our findings make a step towards topologically controlled ultrasmall light sources with nontrivial radiation characteristics. Topological photonics: integrated nanolasersActive topological cavities that can lase at room temperature could bring new opportunities for controlling light in integrated nanophotonic circuits. Smirnova et al. etched a special pattern of nanoscale holes into a 250nm thick slab of the compound semiconductor InGaAsP to create a triangle-shaped cavity with optical behaviour governed by the band topology. The presence of quantum wells in the slab provides the cavity with optical gain allowing it to lase in the near-infrared when excited with nanosecond pump pulses at 980nm. The laser emission is observed to be spectrally narrow with high coherence and hosts a donut-shaped singularity in Fourier space. The achievement opens the way to a new type of nanophotonic light source which exhibits unusual radiation characteristics and suits integration with metasurfaces.

ABSTRACT: Topological interface states in periodic lattices have emerged as valuable assets in the fields of electronics, photonics, and phononics, owing to their inherent robustness against disorder. Unlike electronics and photonics, the linear dispersion relation of hypersound offers an ideal framework for investigating higher-order bandgaps. In this work, we propose a design strategy for the generation and manipulation of topological nanophononic interface states within high-order bandgaps of GaAs/AlAs multilayered structures. These states arise from the band inversion of two concatenated superlattices that exhibit inverted spatial mode symmetries around the bandgap. By adjusting the thickness ratio of the unit cells in these superlattices, we are able to engineer interface states in different bandgaps, enabling the development of versatile topological devices spanning a wide frequency range. Moreover, we demonstrate that such interface states can also be generated in hybrid structures that combine two superlattices with bandgaps of different orders centered around the same frequency. These structures open up avenues for exploring topological confinement in high-order bandgaps, providing a platform for unveiling and better understanding complex topological systems.

ABSTRACT: "Floquet topological photonic insulators, whose light transport properties are dictated by the periodic drive sequence of the lattice, provide more flexibility for controlling and trapping light than undriven topological insulators. This can enable novel nonlinear optics applications in topological photonics. Here, we employ a novel resonance effect called Floquet Defect Mode Resonance (FDMR) in a 2D silicon Floquet microring lattice to demonstrate resonance-enhanced frequency generation by four-wave mixing of Floquet bulk modes in the presence of Kerr nonlinearity. The compact, cavity-less resonance mode, induced through a periodic perturbation of the lattice drive sequence, has the largest reported Q-factor for a 2D topological resonator of ~& nbsp 10(5) with low group velocity dispersion, which enables efficient broadband frequency generation over several Floquet-Brillouin zones of the Floquet topological insulator. We achieved wavelength conversion over a 10.1 nm spectral range with an average enhancement of 12.5 dB in the conversion efficiency due to the FDMR. Our work could lead to robust light sources generated directly on a topologically protected photonic platform. (C) 2022 Author(s)."

ABSTRACT: The topological spin-Hall effect causes different spins to propagate in opposite directions based on Hermitian physics. The non-Hermitian skin effect causes the localization of a large number of modes of a system at its edges. Here we propose a system based on exciton-polariton elliptical micropillars hosting both the effects. The polarization splitting of the elliptical micropillars gives rise to the topological spin-Hall effect in a one-dimensional lattice. When a circularly polarized external incoherent laser is used to imbalance effective decay rates of the different spin polarizations, the system transits to a non-Hermitian regime showing the skin effect. These effects have implications for robust polariton transport as well as the deterministic formation of multiply charged vortices and persistent currents.

ABSTRACT: Coupling of topological interface states in a one dimensional photonic crystal has been systematically investigated in a broad energy region of electromagnetic spectrum. The robust topological interface states appear when the Zak phase between the adjoining photonic crystals are different at their common photonic bandgap. The coupled interface states created combining three photonic crystals are useful for the spatial confinement and enhancement of electric fields, which could find potential applications in nonlinear photonics and multichannel filters. Anticrossing observed in the dispersion confirms the strong coupling between the topological interface states and causes Rabi-like splitting between them. The splitting energy is found decreasing with increasing number of unit cells in the photonic crystal. The angular and polarization dependency of the coupled states are studied in detail. The resonant wavelength position and bandwidth of the dual reflectivity dips corresponding to the coupled interface states are polarization sensitive and tunable with varying angle of incidence of light.

ABSTRACT: We introduce a class of topological lasers based on the photonic Floquet topological insulator concept. The proposed system is realized as a truncated array of lasing helical waveguides, where the pseudomagnetic field arises due to twisting of the waveguides along the propagation direction that breaks the time-reversal symmetry and opens up a topological gap. When sufficient gain is provided in the edge channels of the array, the system lases into topological edge states. Topological lasing is stable only in certain intervals of the Bloch momenta that ensure a dynamic, but stable balance between the linear amplification and nonlinear absorption leading to the formation of breathing edge states. We also illustrate topological robustness of the edge currents by simulating lattice defects and triangular arrangements of the waveguides.

ABSTRACT: Slow light topological photonic crystal waveguide offers an attractive platform for enhancing light-matter interaction. We design a slow light rainbow trapping based on translational valley photonic crystal waveguides constructed by a gradient interface width. Through theoretical analysis and numerical calculation, the resulting structure supports topologically protected edge states at different frequencies. The edge state can be slowed down to zero group velocity and trapped at different positions. Moreover, the switch between slow light trapped states and transport states can be easily realized by tuning the structural parameter. Our work can help open up a new avenue to control the flow of light and find great potential for applications such as optical buffers and wavelength-division multiplexing.

ABSTRACT: Topological insulators are a class of electronic materials exhibiting robust edge states immune to perturbations and disorder. This concept has been successfully adapted in photonics, where topologically nontrivial waveguides and topological lasers were developed. However, the exploration of topological properties in a given photonic system is limited to a fabricated sample, without the flexibility to reconfigure the structure in situ. Here, we demonstrate an all-optical realization of the orbital Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model in a microcavity exciton-polariton system, whereby a cavity photon is hybridized with an exciton in a GaAs quantum well. We induce a zigzag potential for exciton polaritons all-optically by shaping the nonresonant laser excitation, and measure directly the eigenspectrum and topological edge states of a polariton lattice in a nonlinear regime of bosonic condensation. Furthermore, taking advantage of the tunability of the optically induced lattice, we modify the intersite tunneling to realize a topological phase transition to a trivial state. Our results open the way to study topological phase transitions on-demand in fully reconfigurable hybrid photonic systems that do not require sophisticated sample engineering.

ABSTRACT: Topological defects (TDs) in crystal lattices are elementary lattice imperfections that cannot be removed by local perturbations, due to their real-space topology. In the emerging field of topological photonics, photonic topological edge states arise from the nontrivial topology of the band structure defined in momentum space and are generally protected against defects. Here we show that adding TDs into a valley photonic crystal generates a lattice disclination that acts like a domain wall and hosts photonic topological edge states. Unlike previous topological waveguides, the disclination forms an open arc and functions as a free-form waveguide connecting a pair of TDs of opposite topological charge. This interplay between the real-space topology of lattice defects and momentum-space band topology provides a novel scheme to implement large-scale photonic structures with complex arrangements of robust topological waveguides and resonators.

ABSTRACT: Photonic topological transitions (PTTs) in metamaterials open a new realm of research with a number of interesting optical phenomena and provide an efficient route to manipulate light-matter interactions at nanoscale. Here, it is shown that, by tailoring the topology of anisotropic metamaterial's equi-frequency surface, a narrow angular optical transparency window appears around the PTT frequency, which makes the metamaterial strongly discriminate the light based primarily on the angle of incidence. In experimental implementation, a large-scale nanowire metamaterial is fabricated by bottom-up approach and achieves a highly transparent window with a narrow angular range at visible frequency. Based on this angular transparency effect, the metamaterial is further demonstrated to be capable of significantly suppressing the diffraction and interference of the light scattered from arbitrarily shaped objects and projecting their diffraction-limited images into far field. These features make the metamaterials hold promise for a series of angle-dependent optical applications.

ABSTRACT: By using a reflection type of topological insulator Bi2Te3 as saturable absorber that was prepared by a hydrothermal intercalation/exfoliation method, we have demonstrated the stable Q-switched mode-locked operation of Nd:YVO4 solid-state laser. Its maximum output power can reach up to 247 mW with respect to the absorbed pump power of 6.39 W. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report for passively Q-switched mode-locking Nd:YVO4 solid-state laser at 1-mu m wavelength using a topological insulator Bi2Te3 as saturable absorber. In the experiment, we have also observed the stable Q-switched operation with pulse width as short as 2 mu s, output power 183 mW, and repetition rate up to 151.5 kHz.

ABSTRACT: The chaotic evolution resulting from the interplay between topology and nonlinearity in photonic systems generally forbids the sustainability of optical currents. Here, we systematically explore the nonlinear evolution dynamics in topological photonic lattices within the framework of optical thermodynamics. By considering an archetypical two-dimensional Haldane photonic lattice, we discover several prethermal states beyond the topological phase transition point and a stable global equilibrium response, associated with a specific optical temperature and chemical potential. Along these lines, we provide a consistent thermodynamic methodology for both controlling and maximizing the unidirectional power flow in the topological edge states. This can be achieved by either employing cross-phase interactions between two subsystems or by exploiting self-heating effects in disordered or Floquet topological lattices. Our results indicate that photonic topological systems can in fact support robust photon transport processes even under the extreme complexity introduced by nonlinearity, an important feature for contemporary topological applications in photonics. The nonlinear evolution dynamics in topological photonic lattices is systematically investigated within the framework of optical thermodynamics. This approach allows for the precise prediction of topological currents even under the extreme complexity introduced by nonlinearity.

ABSTRACT: Replacing part of a conventional optical circuit with a topological photonic system allows for various controls of optical vortices in the optical circuit. As an underlying technology for this, in this study, we have realized a topological converter that provides high coupling efficiency between a normal silicon wire waveguide and a topological edge waveguide. After expanding the waveguide width while maintaining single-mode transmission from the Si wire waveguide, the waveguides are gradually narrowed from both sides by using a structure in which nanoholes with C-6 symmetry are arranged in a honeycomb lattice. On the basis of the analysis using the three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain method, we actually fabricated a device in which a Si wire waveguide and a topological edge waveguide were connected via the proposed topological converter and evaluated its transmission characteristics. The resulting coupling efficiency between the Si wire waveguide and the topological edge waveguide through the converter was -4.49 dB/taper, and the coupling efficiency was improved by 5.12 dB/taper compared to the case where the Si wire waveguide and the topological edge waveguide were connected directly.

ABSTRACT: Photonic structures with topologically nontrivial bands are usually designed by arranging simple meta-atoms, ideally, single-mode ones, in a carefully designed photonic lattice with symmetry that guarantees the emergence of topological states. Here we investigate an alternative option that does not require complex lattice geometry but instead relies on the tuning of the parameters of the individual meta-atoms to achieve the degeneracy of the modes with different symmetry. As an illustrative example, we consider a one-dimensional array of equidistant identical periodic nanophotonic waveguides supporting degenerate modes with strongly asymmetric near-field profiles giving rise to the coupling modulation. Exploiting this feature, we demonstrate that the proposed system supports topological edge modes and can be viewed as a generalization of the paradigmatic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, reducing to it for the suitable parameter choice. Our results thus provide an avenue to engineer topological states via mode interference which further expands the plethora of topological structures available in photonics being especially promising for nonlinear topological systems.

ABSTRACT: We show theoretically that, in the limit of weak dispersion, one-dimensional binary centrosymmetric photonic crystals can support topological edge modes in all photonic bandgaps. By analyzing their bulk band topology, these harmonic topological edge modes can be designed in a way that they exist at all photonic bandgaps opened at the center of the Brillouin zone, at all gaps opened at the zone boundaries, or both. The results may suggest a new approach to achieve robust multi-frequency coupled modes for applications in nonlinear photonics, such as frequency upconversion. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America

ABSTRACT: Higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs), a new horizon of topological phases of matter, host lower-dimensional corner or hinge states, providing important stepping stones to the realization of robust topological waveguides in higher dimensions. The nontrivial band topology that gives rise to the corner or hinge states is usually enabled by certain crystalline symmetries. As a result, higher-order topological boundary states are tied to specific corners or hinges, lacking the flexibility of switching and selecting. Here, we report the experimental realization of topologically switchable and valley-selective corner states in a two-dimensional sonic crystal. Such intriguing properties are enabled by exploiting the higher-order topology assisted with the valley degree of freedom. For this purpose, we realize a valley HOTI of second-order topology characterized by the nontrivial bulk polarization. Interestingly, the hosted corner states are found to be valley dependent and therefore enable flexible control and manipulation on the wave localization. Topological switch on or off and valley selection of the corner states are directly observed through spatial scanning of the sound field. We further design an arbitrary structure of complex patterns containing corners with various intersection angles, among which selected corners can be illuminated or darkened upon valley selection. The reported valley HOTI and the valley-selective corner states provide fundamental understanding on the interplay between higher-order topology and valley degree of freedom and pave the way for lower-dimensional valleytronics, which may find potential applications in integrated acoustics and photonics.

ABSTRACT: Counter-propagating chiral edge states are demonstrated in a photonic structure able to effectively incorporate fermionic time-reversal symmetry, thus providing the photonic implementation of an electronic topological insulator. Much of the recent attention directed towards topological insulators is motivated by their hallmark feature of protected chiral edge states. In electronic (or fermionic) topological insulators, these states originate from time-reversal symmetry and allow carriers with opposite spin-polarization to propagate in opposite directions at the edge of an insulating bulk. By contrast, photonic (or bosonic) systems are generally assumed to be precluded from supporting edge states that are intrinsically protected by time-reversal symmetry. Here, we experimentally demonstrate counter-propagating chiral states at the edge of a time-reversal-symmetric photonic waveguide structure. The pivotal step in our approach is the design of a Floquet driving protocol that incorporates effective fermionic time-reversal symmetry, enabling the realization of the photonic version of an electronic topological insulator. Our findings allow for fermionic properties to be harnessed in bosonic systems, thereby offering alternative opportunities for photonics as well as acoustics, mechanical waves and cold atoms.

ABSTRACT: In contrast to the orbital angular momentum (OAM), which is conserved on free space propagation, the topological charge (TC) of a paraxial optical vortex (OV) is not conserved in the general case. Here, we investigate a Gaussian beam with a fractional TC in the original plane and demonstrate both theoretically and numerically how the TC changes in the course of propagation. Depending on the proximity of the topological charge to an even or odd integer number, an optical vortex with the original fractional TC is shown to behave in a number of different ways. For simple OVs (Laguerre-Gaussian or Bessel-Gaussian modes), TC is conserved both in propagation and after weak phase distortions. An experiment shows that when scattered by a random phase screen, the integer TC of an OV is conserved right up to a random phase variation of pi. Therefore, in the case of weak turbulences, it is expedient to measure a discretely varying TC instead of a continuously varying OAM.

ABSTRACT: Triple-fold band degeneracy (TBD) is an intriguing phase of topological semimetals which appears as the intermediate state between the four-folded degenerated Dirac points and the two-folded Weyl points. The resemblance of TBD in the photonics is interesting, because it indicates nonzero Berry curvature in momentum space and nontrivial topological property in real space. Recently, it was reported that TBD could be realized in the classical wave systems including phononic and photonic crystals. Unfortunately, those periodic structures can hardly provide a systematic strategy nor a compact layout in practical implementations. Hence, the resemblance of TBD is still a big challenge in topological photonics. In this work, we demonstrate that homogeneous gyromagnetic metamaterials (GMs) can be a good framework to stimulate the peculiar TBD. We discuss the emulation of triple degeneracy in dispersive GMs by carefully tuning the constitutive parameters. The introduction of nonlocality in the constitutive parameter of GMs provides the freedom of topology control of the GMs. Further, Fermi arc surface states are discussed and shown to be reflectionless against sharp corners. Remarkably, Fermi arc surface states, which occur at the boundary between the vacuum and the GMs, can be stretchable by tailoring the gap width of the GM's band structure. Our work provides a practical and flexible route to resemble TBD, which is of fundamental importance in designing reflectionless and unidirectional photonic topological devices.

ABSTRACT: "Patterned surfaces with rationally designed nanostructures provide a flexible platform for beam shaping in both the linear and nonlinear optical regime. The properties of reflected or diffracted output depend on the Fourier transform of the surface profile. To obtain ideal effects, the profile should contain a desired sum of specially formed sinusoidal terms with predefined superposition coefficients. Such a kind of surface is vividly described as a wavy surface in certain contexts, which has been widely utilized for linear optical applications. However, the nonlinear counterparts are rarely demonstrated. Here, we present a design framework of nonlinear wavy surfaces based on hybrid nanostructures of metal and multi-quantum-well (MQW) for generating and steering second-harmonic beams. Giant second-order nonlinearity is available in MQWs  thus, an efficient up-conversion process can be ensured. In this system, the harmonic output is determined by the Fourier spectrum of spatially dependent second-order nonlinearity, which can be engineered through tailoring the shape, orientation, and arrangement of nanoelements known as meta-atoms. Compared with previously proposed nonlinear metasurfaces, the wavy design can be more flexible for manipulating orbital angular momentum (OAM) states through introducing topological defects. Besides choosing states with expected topological charges and controlling the relative weight, the rule in conventional binary chi((2)) systems that the attached OAM value increases with the order of reflection/diffraction can be broken via suitable nanostructure design, which means that lower order is possible to have larger absolute topological charge. This proposed framework has tremendous potential for applications in emerging areas such as quantum nanophotonics and topological photonics."

ABSTRACT: The discovery of two-dimensional topological photonic systems has transformed our views on the propagation and scattering of electromagnetic waves, and the quest for similar states in three dimensions is open. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that it is possible to design symmetry-protected three-dimensional topological states in an all-dielectric platform, with the electromagnetic duality between electric and magnetic fields being ensured by the structure design. Magneto-electrical coupling plays the role of a synthetic gauge field that determines a topological transition to an 'insulating' regime with a complete three-dimensional photonic bandgap. We reveal the emergence of surface states with conical Dirac dispersion and spin-locking, and we numerically confirm robust propagation of the surface states along two-dimensional domain walls with first-principles studies. The proposed system represents a table-top platform capable of emulating the relativistic dynamics of massive Dirac fermions and the surface states can be interpreted as Jackiw-Rebbi states bound to the interface separating domains with particles of opposite masses.

ABSTRACT: Optical vortices (OVs) have received much attention in recent years and are widely explored in communication applications. The on-chip vortex emitter/modulator is preferred when it comes to photonic integration and chip-scale communication. However, the existing emitters/modulators suffer from either narrow bandwidths or extensibility problems, which actually degrade their ability to improve communication capacity. Here, we propose a metasurface OV emitter based on wave vector synthesis for vortex generation and modulation. A thorough theoretical analysis of the OV generation by two approximate methods was carried out, which suggests the superiority of Wave Vector method over Phase method. Afterwards, the wave vector manipulation implemented by Phase gradient metasurfaces was studied for controlling the topological charges of generated OVs. Finite element method simulations showed that, in the topological charge range of -6 to 6 and the wavelength range of 1.45 mu m to 1.55 mu m, the effective vortex emission efficiency of the proposed emitter is around 45%. The on-chip vortex generation and control by wave vector manipulation is a very promising technology for high-capacity inter-chip optical communication.

ABSTRACT: In this paper, Topological insulator (TI) Bi2Se3 as a saturable absorber (SA) is exploited to Q-switch fiber lasers at 2 mu m wavelength for the first time. Few-layer TI:Bi2Se3 nanosheets in CS-HAc solution are prepared by the liquid-phase exfoliation method, and the thin 2-D structure with the thickness of 3-5 layers is well characterized. The open-aperture Z-scan experiment shows that the few-layer TI:Bi2Se3 has the saturable optical intensity of 41 MW/cm(2) at 800 nm and the modulation depth of 3.7%. The optical deposition technique is used to efficiently assemble the TI:Bi2Se3 nanosheets in the solution onto a fiber ferrule, therefore constructing a fiber-compatible TI-based SA (FC-TISA). By further inserting the FC-TISA into a diode-pumped Tm3+-doped double-clad fiber laser (TM-DCFL), stable Q-switching operation at 1.98 mu m is successfully achieved with the shortest pulse width of 4.18 mu s and the tunable repetition rate from 8.4 to 26.8 kHz. In particular, the TM-DCFL can deliver large-energy Q-switched pulses with the pulse energy as high as 313 nJ (corresponding to average output power of 8.4 mW). Our results suggest that TI-based SA is suitable for pulsed laser operation in the eye-safe region of 2 mu m, and potentially develops as an ultra-broadband photonics device.

ABSTRACT: The bright-dark soliton pair in a passively mode-locked fiber laser based on the topological insulator: Bi2Se3/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) film in the proper polarization state and the pump power is experimentally demonstrated. By carefully adjusting the pump power and the polarization state, the bright-dark soliton pair could be easily observed. Furthermore, it is found experimentally that the formation of the bright-dark soliton pair is mainly due to the polarization effect based on the high nonlinear effect of topological insulator: Bi2Se3/PVA film. We also demonstrate that the pulse shape of the bright-dark soliton pair can be affected by the total net cavity dispersion in the fiber laser.

ABSTRACT: Photonic crystal fibers represent one of the most active research fields in modern fiber optics. The recent advancements in topological photonics have inspired new fiber concepts and designs. Here, we demonstrate a new, to the best of our knowledge, type of topological photonic crystal fiber based on second-order photonic corner modes from the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. Different from previous works where the in-plane properties at k(z) = 0 have been mainly studied, we find that in the fiber configuration of k(z) > 0, a topological bandgap exists only when the propagation constant k(z) along the fiber axis is larger than a certain threshold and the emergent topological bandgap at large k(z) hosts two sets of corner fiber modes. We further investigate the propagation diagrams, propose a convenient way to tune the frequencies of the corner fiber modes within the topological bandgap, and envisage multi-frequency and multi-channel transmission capabilities of this new type of fiber. Our work will not only have practical importance, but could also open a new area for fiber exploration where many existing higher-order topological photonic modes could bring exciting new opportunities for fiber designs and applications.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonic devices provide a powerful platform to control the flow of light because their topologically protected edge states can be immune to backscattering and be robust to impurities, disorders, and defects. As one of the topological photonic systems, valley photonic crystals have attracted great attention because they can achieve a large bandgap and be easily combined with modern micro-nano fabrication technology. Terahertz photonic devices are of enormous interest in next-generation communications. Here, we design a valley photonic crystal consisting of a triangular lattice with three metal rod scatterers. By rotating the three metal rods in opposite directions to break the inversion symmetry, we achieve a bandgap width of up to 70% and observe the transport of the edge states in the terahertz region. By replacing part of the structure with phase change material VO2, on/off switching of the terahertz photonic topological edge states is realized, and the attenuation can be also modeled by adjusting the size of the VO2 region. The proposed regime has potential applications in sensing and 6G communications.

ABSTRACT: We realize moire fringe induced gauge field in a double-layer photonic honeycomb metacrystal with mismatched lattice constants. Benefitting from the generated strong effective gauge field, we report direct measurement of the band diagrams of both Landau level flat bands and intermagnetic-domain edge states. Importantly, we observe the correlation between the momentum and orbital position of the Landau modes, serving as an evidence of the noncommuteness between orthogonal components of the momentum. Without complicated time driving mechanics and careful site-by-site engineering, moire superlattices could emerge as a powerful means to generate effective gauge fields for photonics benefiting from its simplicity and reconfigurability, which can be applied to nonlinearity enhancement and lasing applications at optical frequencies.

ABSTRACT: Topological singularities (TSs) in momentum space give rise to intriguing fundamental phenomena as well as unusual material properties, attracting a great deal of interest in the past decade. Recently, we demonstrated universal momentum-to-real space mapping of TSs and pseudospin angular momentum conversion using photonic honeycomb (graphene-like) and Lieb lattices. Such mapping arises from the nontrivial Berry phase winding and is thus of topological origin. In this paper, after a brief review of previous observations of pseudospin-orbital conversion, we present the first theoretical analysis and experimental demonstration of TS mapping in a new type of Dirac-like structure, namely, the T-graphene lattice. Unlike other lattices, there are two coexisting but distinct TSs located at different high symmetry points in the first Brillouin zone of T-graphene, which enables controlled topological charge conversion in the same lattice. We show active manipulation of the TS mapping, turning the two TSs into vortices of different helicities, or one into a high-order vortex but the other eliminated and emerged as a quadrupole. Such mapping and manipulation of TSs may find applications in optical communications and quantum information, and may bring insight into the study of other Dirac-like structures with multiple TSs beyond the 2D photonic platform.

ABSTRACT: Nonlinear topological photonics, which explores topics common to the fields of topological phases and nonlinear optics, is expected to open up a new paradigm in topological photonics. Here, we demonstrate second-harmonic generation (SHG) via nonlinear interaction of double topological valley-Hall kink modes in all-dielectric photonic crystals (PhCs). We first show that two topological frequency band gaps can be created around a pair of frequencies, omega(0) and 2(omega 0), by gapping out the corresponding Dirac points in two-dimensional honeycomb PhCs. Valley-Hall kink modes along a kink-type domain wall interface between two PhCs placed together in a mirror-symmetric manner are generated within the two frequency band gaps. Importantly, through full-wave simulations and mode dispersion analysis, we demonstrate that tunable, bidirectional phase-matched SHG via nonlinear interaction of the valley-Hall kink modes inside the two band gaps can be achieved. In particular, by using Stokes parameters associated with the magnetic part of the valley-Hall kink modes, we introduce the concept of SHG directional dichroism, which is employed to characterize optical probes for sensing chiral molecules. Our work opens up avenues toward topologically protected nonlinear frequency mixing and active photonic devices implemented in all-dielectric material platforms.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics has made great progress from physical concept verification to new technical applications, and valley topological photonic crystal (TPCs) are one of the most important candidates for future applications in functional devices because of large bandwidth and lossless optical transport. However, due to the limitations of the design method and structure arrangement, the multichannel valley topological beam splitter (BS) has not yet been much explored. Here, we reveal the different robustness of four types of domain walls in valley TPCs. Benefiting from the differences in domain walls, we numerically present and experimentally demonstrate a highly integrated multichannel valley topological BS in the microwave regime. Compared with traditional BSs, it has the advantages of being more robust and compact and having more output ports and higher integration. The reported multichannel topological BS opens an avenue to engineer the flow of light and offers effective design approaches for integrated photonic device miniaturization.

ABSTRACT: Higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs) have attracted much attention in photonics due to the tightly localized disorder-robust corner and hinge states. Here, we reveal an unconventional HOTI phase with vanishing dipole and quadrupole polarizations. This phase arises in the array of evanescently coupled waveguides hosting degenerate s- and d-type orbital modes arranged in a square lattice with four waveguides in the unit cell. As we prove, the degeneracy of the modes with the different symmetry gives rise to the nontrivial topological properties rendering the system topologically equivalent to the two copies of the anisotropic two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model rotated by 90??? with respect to each other and based on s ?? d hybridized orbitals. We probe the unusual topology of the model by constructing a quantized Fu-Kane-type pseudospin pump. Our results introduce a route to tailor higher-order band topology leveraging both crystalline symmetries and accidental degeneracies of the different orbital modes.

ABSTRACT: Valley Hall topological photonic crystals, inspired by topological insulators in condensed matter physics, have provided a promising solution to control the flow of light. Recently, the dynamic manipulation property of topological photonic crystals has been widely studied. Here, we propose a novel solution for programmable valley photonic crystals, called field programmable topological edge array (FPTEA), based on the field reorientation property of nematic liquid crystals and robust valley-protected edge modes. FPTEA is composed of an array of graphene-like lattices with C3 symmetry, in which the birefringence of liquid crystal is larger than 0.5105. Due to the dielectric anisotropy of liquid crystals being sensitive to external fields such as light, heat, electric, and magnetic fields, each lattice is tunable, and the topological propagation routes and even the lattice parameters can be dynamically changed while changing the distribution of external fields. We numerically demonstrate three methods of composing an FPTEA device to design arbitrary passive optical devices by electric driving, thermal inducing, or UV writing. These results show the great application potential of liquid crystals in topological photonic crystals, and enrich the design of programmable integrated topological devices with broad working bandwidth ranging from microwave to visible light.

ABSTRACT: Nonlinear phenomena in the THz spectral domain are important for understanding the optoelectronic properties of quantum systems and provide a basis for modern information technologies. Here, we report a giant THz nonlinearity in high-mobility 2D topological insulators based on HgTe quantum wells, which manifests itself in a highly efficient third harmonic generation. We observe a third harmonic THz susceptibility several times higher than that in bare graphene and many orders of magnitude higher than that in trivial quantum well structures based on other materials. To explain the strong nonlinearity of HgTe-based heterostructures at the THz frequencies, we consider the acceleration of free carriers with a high mobility and variable dispersion. This acceleration model, for which the nonparabolicity of the band dispersion is key, in combination with independently measured scattering time and conductivity, is in good agreement with our experimental data in a wide temperature range for THz fields below the saturation. Our approach provides a route to material engineering for THz applications based on frequency conversion.

ABSTRACT: The hallmark of topological insulators (TIs) is the scatter-free propagation of waves in topologically protected edge channels(1). This transport is strictly chiral on the outer edge of the medium and therefore capable of bypassing sharp corners and imperfections, even in the presence of substantial disorder. In photonics, two-dimensional (2D) topological edge states have been demonstrated on several different platforms(2-4) and are emerging as a promising tool for robust lasers(5), quantum devices(6-8) and other applications. More recently, 3D TIs were demonstrated in microwaves(9) and acoustic waves(10-13), where the topological protection in the latter is induced by dislocations. However, at optical frequencies, 3D photonic TIs have so far remained out of experimental reach. Here we demonstrate a photonic TI with protected topological surface states in three dimensions. The topological protection is enabled by a screw dislocation. For this purpose, we use the concept of synthetic dimensions(14-17) in a 2D photonic waveguide array(18) by introducing a further modal dimension to transform the system into a 3D topological system. The lattice dislocation endows the system with edge states propagating along 3D trajectories, with topological protection akin to strong photonic TIs(19,20). Our work paves the way for utilizing 3D topology in photonic science and technology.

ABSTRACT: Topological insulators as new emerging building blocks in electronics and photonics present promising prospects for exciting surface plasmons and enhancing light-matter interaction. Thus, exploring the visible-range plasmonic response of topological insulators is significant to reveal their optical characteristics and broaden their applications at high frequencies. Herein, we report the experimental demonstration of a visible-range surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect on an antimony telluride (Sb2Te3) topological insulator film. The results show that the SPR can be excited with a relatively small incident angle in the Kretschmann configuration based on the Sb2Te3 film. Especially, we develop an impactful digital holographic imaging system based on the topological insulator SPR and realize the dynamic monitoring of refractive index variation. Compared with the traditional SPR, the Sb2Te3-based SPR possesses a broader measurement range. Our findings open a new avenue for exploring the optical physics and practical applications of topological insulators, such as environmental and biochemical sensing.

ABSTRACT: We demonstrated a stable passively Q-switched Er-doped fiber laser around the optical communication band with a microfiber-based topological insulator (TI) Bi2Te3 saturable absorber. The saturable absorber was fabricated by the optical deposition method and its nonlinear transmission similar to 1568 nm was characterized. By virtue of the TI saturable absorber, stable Q-switched pulses can be formed with pulse repetition rate increasing from 2.6 to 12 kHz, and pulse duration decreasing from 50 mu s to 9.5 mu s through altering the pump strength. Our results evidently show the effectiveness of Bi2Te3-based saturable absorber and its potential applications for pulsed laser generation.

ABSTRACT: Rich topological phenomena, edge states, and two types of corner states are unveiled in a two-dimensional squarelattice all-dielectric photonic crystal without both C4 and Mx(y) symmetries. Specifically, nontrivial type-I corner states, which do not exist in systems with C4 and Mx(y) since the degeneracy, are protected by a nonzero quadrupole moment, no longer quantized to but less than 0.5. Excellent properties, for example, subwavelength localization and air-concentrated field distribution, are presented. Type-II corner states, induced by long-range interactions, are easier to be realized due to asymmetry. This work broadens the topological physics for the symmetries-broken systems and provides potential applications.

ABSTRACT: The polarization singularities in momentum space, rather than in real space, are capturing interest for active singular optics with exotic light scattering and various topological phenomena, which have potential applications in vortex nano-lasers, valley exciton emission, and others. Here, we propose to magnetically control the polarization singularities in momentum space in the photonic crystal slabs with inversion spatial symmetry (P symmetry). A pair of C points (circular polarization points) with the same topological charge is spawned from a V point (polarization vortex center), and they can be dynamically shifted in momentum space with the variation of the magnetic field. Moreover, the coupling between transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) modes induced by the magnetic field gives rise to a hybrid mode, which can close certain leaky channels to achieve an accidentalVpoint. Such active manipulation of polarization singularities with magnetic field is promised for various applications in light-matter interactions and reveals novel phenomena and physics in singular optics and topological photonics.

ABSTRACT: The recent advancements in higher-order topology have provided unprecedented opportunities in optical device designs and applications. Here, we propose a new, to the best of our knowledge, method to realize rainbow trapping based on higher-order topological corner modes (HOTCMs), which are constructed by two configurations of breathing kagome photonic crystals with distinct topological phases. Interestingly, the HOTCMs localized at corners with different geometric configurations are found to be frequency dispersive and thus initiate the possible application in realizing rainbow trapping. By designing a polygon structure containing several configurations of corners, we demonstrate that the HOTCMs can be excited with the frequency sequence locked to the corner order (clockwise/anticlockwise direction) in the polygon. The reported HOTCMs provide a new mechanism to realize multiple-frequency trapping, which may find potential applications in future integrated photonics. (C) 2022 Optica Publishing Group

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics have provided new insights for the manipulation of light. Analogous to electrons in topological insulators, photons travelling through the surface of a topological photonic structure or the interface of two photonic structures with different topological phases are free from backscattering caused by structural imperfections or disorder. This exotic nature of the topological edge state (TES) is truly beneficial for nanophotonic devices that suffer from structural irregularities generated during device fabrication. Although various topological states and device concepts have been demonstrated in photonic systems, lasers based on a topological photonic crystal (PhC) cavity array with a wavelength-scale modal volume have not been explored. We investigated TESs in a PhC nanocavity array in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. Upon optical excitation, the topological PhC cavity array realised using an InP-based multiple-quantum-well epilayer spontaneously exhibits lasing peaks at the topological edge and bulk states. TES characteristics, including the modal robustness caused by immunity to scattering, are confirmed from the emission spectra and near-field imaging and by theoretical simulations and calculations.

ABSTRACT: Robust and efficient light coupling into and out of quantum valley-Hall (QVH) topological interfaces within near-infrared frequencies is demanded in order to be integrated into practical two-dimensional (2D) optical chips. Here, we numerically demonstrate efficient light coupling between a QVH interface and a pair of input/output silicon photonic waveguides in the presence of photonic crystal line defects. When the topological QVH interface is directly end-butt coupled to the silicon waveguides, the input-to-output transmission efficiency is lower than 50% and the exterior boundaries associated with a QVH interface also cause inevitable back-reflections and high-order scatterings, further reducing the transmission efficiency. The transmission efficiency is substantially increased to 95.8% (94.3%) when photonic crystal line defects are introduced between the bridge (zigzag) QVH interface and the waveguides. The buffering line defect mode, with an effective group refractive index between the interface state and the waveguide mode will ease their mode profile conversion. The design we present here brings no fabrication complexity and may be used as a guide for future implementation of on-chip 2D topological photonics.

ABSTRACT: Although the topological charge of a beam carrying an optical vortex is an important parameter, only low-order topological charge can be determined with most existing methods. We improve the Mach-Zehnder interferometer to measure the magnitude of the topological charge of Laguerre-Gaussian beam from the bright interference petals produced by the beam and its conjugate beam, and a plane mirror is used on one arm of the interferometer to produce the conjugate beam. Furthermore, the sign of the topological charge is determined by passing the beam through a triangular aperture and analyzing the diffraction field. We demonstrate that the magnitude and sign of the topological charge up to +/- 120 can be determined with this method.

ABSTRACT: Exploring the interaction between topological phases and non-Hermitian potentials such as gain and loss can benefit designing robust optical devices. Recent studies have revealed topological phases can be simply from gain and loss in non-Hermitian systems. Here, we propose an extended kagome lattice model, where the non-Hermitian potentials drive the system from a trivial phase to a higher-order topological phase. Higher-order topological insulators exhibit lower-dimensional boundary states on corners or hinges. We construct two-dimensional higher-order topological insulators on different arrays of the extended kagome lattice model. Topologically protected states emerge at the corner with a 1/3 fractional charge at each corner as the strength of the gain and loss increases. The topologically protected corner states are characterized by the quantized polarization as the topological index. We find that non-Hermitian potentials provide an extra degree of freedom to switch on and off the higher-order topological corner states. The proposed system can be verified through many experimental platforms, including coupled optical resonating cavities and waveguides. Our work indicates the great prospects for constructing integrated photonics platforms and designing actively reconfigurable photonic devices.

ABSTRACT: The rise of quantum science and technologies motivates photonics research to seek new platforms with strong light-matter interactions to facilitate quantum behaviors at moderate light intensities. Topological polaritons (TPs) offer an ideal platform in this context, with unique properties stemming from resilient topological states of light strongly coupled with matter. Here we explore polaritonic metasurfaces based on 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) as a promising platform for topological polaritonics. We show that the strong coupling between topological photonic modes of the metasurface and excitons in TMDs yields a topological polaritonic Z(2) phase. We experimentally confirm the emergence of one-way spin-polarized edge TPs in metasurfaces integrating MoSe2 and WSe2. Combined with the valley polarization in TMD monolayers, the proposed system enables an approach to engage the photonic angular momentum and valley and spin of excitons, offering a promising platform for photonic/solid-state interfaces for valleytronics and spintronics. In this work light and matter have been coupled in a strong interaction between exciton resonances and topological photonic bands. The authors herein demonstrate a Z2 spin-Hall topological polaritonic phase enabling new coupling schemes in valleytronics and spintronics.

ABSTRACT: The procedure of measuring the birefringent plate parameters is discussed. It is shown that these parameters, both optical and geometric, can be measured with the help of Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The phase measured by means of an interferometer is a sum of several separate phases each of which is connected with a specific characteristic of the plate. Some of theses phase are optical topological phases such as Rytov-Vladimirskii and Pancharantnam phases. Using their properties one can pick separate terms out of the general sum measured by the interferometer using the beams of different polarization.

ABSTRACT: We experimentally demonstrate Q-switched and mode-locked Erbium-doped fiber laser (EDFL) by using topological insulator (TI) Bismuth Selenide (Bi2Se3) as saturable absorber (SA). The fabricated Bi2Se3 SA exhibits modulation depth and saturation intensity at 39.8% and 90.2 MW/cm(2), respectively. By incorporating the fabricated Bi2Se3 SA into the laser cavity, Q-switching operation is generated with repetition rate ranging from 23.5 kHz to 68.2 kHz, pulse width ranging from 2.4 mu s to 8.6 mu s and maximum peak power is calculated at 19.9 mW. Our cavity can also generate soliton mode-locked pulse with repetition rate of 23.3 MHz and pulse width of 0.63 ps by inserting an additional 5 m long single mode fiber (SMF) into the existing laser cavity. Spectral peaks due to Kelly side-bands and four wave mixing (FWM) were observed on the soliton spectrum. Both Q-switching and mode-locking pulses are stable in the laboratory environment, allowing the realization of compact and low cost pulsed fiber laser with Bi2Se3 SA for various photonics applications.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics has become a new and fascinating area in recent years, which enables electromagnetic waves to propagate with negligible backscattering and excellent robustness even when encountering sharp corners or defects. But the flexible tunability of edge and corner states is challenging once the topological photonic crystals (PhCs) have been fabricated. In this paper, we propose a new all-dielectric PhC with C3 symmetry constructed by hexagonal array of petal-like aperture embedded in silicon background. The proposed configuration has much wider energy gap than its triangular counterpart, and hence is suitable for wideband and high-capacity applications. When the apertures are filled with liquid crystals (LCs), the topologically-protected edge and corner states can be regulated through changing the refractive index of the LCs under different bias voltages. Moreover, the robustness of topological protection of edge and corner states is further demonstrated. This is the first demonstration of LC based tunable valley higher-order photonic topological insulator. The tunability of the proposed topological PhCs may be beneficial for development of tunable optical waveguides, reconfigurable topological microcavities, and other intelligent topological optical/terahertz devices.(c) 2022 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

ABSTRACT: We study linear and nonlinear topological edge states on the domain wall (DW) of two helical waveguide arrays with opposite helicities. This composite helical structure is constructed by using the multibeam interference (MBI) method, in which the helix pitch and helicity is readily modulated by varying the topological charge of an interfering vortex beam. The topological edge states are characterized by the gap Chern number, and their propagation dynamics are controlled by the tunable lattice DW structure. In the linear region, we find the edge states exist only within a threshold value of the helical radius and for a certain disorder of the helix pitch. In the nonlinear region, surprisingly, we find that it is possible to form quasi-solitons along the DW, including multipole-like edge solitons whose different poles on either side of the DW exhibit opposite helicities. The long-distance propagation dynamics of such DW solitons are numerically studied from the evolution of their intensity patterns and the center of mass.

ABSTRACT: Topological states in photonics offer novel prospects for guiding and manipulating photons and facilitate the development of modern optical components for a variety of applications. Over the past few years, photonic topology physics has evolved and unveiled various unconventional optical properties in these topological materials, such as silicon photonic crystals. However, the design of such topological states still poses a significant challenge. Conventional optimization schemes often fail to capture their complex high dimensional design space. In this manuscript, we develop a deep learning framework to map the design space of topological states in the photonic crystals. This framework overcomes the limitations of existing deep learning implementations. Specifically, it reconciles the dimension mismatch between the input (topological properties) and output (design parameters) vector spaces and the non-uniqueness that arises from one-to-many function mappings. We use a fully connected deep neural network (DNN) architecture for the forward model and a cyclic convolutional neural network (cCNN) for the inverse model. The inverse architecture contains the pre-trained forward model in tandem, thereby reducing the prediction error significantly.

ABSTRACT: A multi-wavelength pulse is generated using chemical vapor deposition method (CVD) to fabricate the topological crystalline insulator (TCI) Pb1-XSnXTe as a saturated absorber (SA). Compared with other SA materials, Pb1-XSnXTe have advantages of narrowbandgap and high optical absorption in the near-infrared region. The laser produced a stable four-wavelength lasing configuration characterized by a wavelength spacing of approximately 2 nm, with pulse duration, repetition rate, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 0.899 to 0.854 mu s, 1.08 to 1.15 MHz, and 31.5 dB, respectively. The results indicate that the Pb1-XSnXTe-SA is suitable for pulsed generation in the near-infrared region and its potential in various fields, including super-resolution imaging, high-density optical storage, and three-dimensional laser lithography.

ABSTRACT: The third-order topological insulators based on three-dimensional (3D) photonic crystals (PCs) have hardly been achieved because the nontrivial bandgap in 3D PCs is diffi-cult to form. In this Letter, we elaborately construct 3D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattice in which the periodic modulation of refractive index is uniform in three axis directions. The high-order topological PCs are characterized by the non-trivial bulk polarizations and the mirror eigenvalues. Such a structure can achieve topological 1-codimensional surface states, 2-codimensional hinge states, and 3-codimensional corner states. More importantly, it is found for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that the topological states exhibit a degeneration behavior, i. e., the corner, and hinge state, or corner and surface states coexist at nearly the same frequency, but maintain their own mode properties. The multiple topological states in 3D PCs as well as the degeneration of topological states will open a new window for the study of topological photonics.(c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group

ABSTRACT: The Mie resonances of high-index nanostructures offer the possibility of manipulating light with extremely low loss. Enhanced optical magnetism, with a concomitant significant increase in the quality factor, can be achieved in high-index metasurfaces by adding a highly reflective backplane to the system. Here, we show that Mie-resonance-based hybrid metasurfaces consisting of an array of amorphous silicon nanodisks on a gold backplane can be used to manipulate light polarization upon reflection. Reflection matrix analysis reveals the nontrivial topological property associated with the Mie resonance of individual nanodisks. The topologically protected polarization conversion effect allows the generation of abundant and diverse polarization in the reflected waves by varying the incident wavevector. By presenting proof-of-concept demonstrations based on nonlinear modeling, we further show that the considered hybrid metasurfaces can serve as a platform for ultrafast all-optical polarization switching of near-infrared light. The topological nature of the metasurfaces response offers great flexibility in polarization generation and dynamic modulation.

ABSTRACT: Confining light by plasmonic waveguides is promising for miniaturizing optical components, while topological photonics has been explored for robust light localization. Here we propose combining the two approaches into a simple periodically perforated plasmonic waveguide (PPW) design exhibiting robust localization of long-range surface plasmon polaritons. We predict the existence of a topological edge state originating from a quantized topological invariant, and numerically demonstrate the viability of its excitation at telecommunication wavelength using near-field and waveguide-based approaches. Strong modification of the radiative lifetime of dipole emitters by the edge state, and its robustness to disorder, are demonstrated. (C) 2022 Optica Publishing Group

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics has attracted remarkable attention in recent years due to its ability to generate robust topological states, especially suitable for the study of cavity quantum electrodynamics. In this work, we present a theoretical study of a topological photonic crystal based on the 2D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, with corner states induced by a rotational operation on the axis parallel to the interface of two different topologies of a photonic crystal, forming a bowtie cavity. The studied topological photonic crystal presents inversion symmetry due to the rotation operation allowing the simultaneous existence of two non-degenerated corner states: one located in the weak coupling regime and the other in the strong coupling regime. Therefore, we present the emergence of distinctive effects from both regimes, such as the Purcell effect and Rabi splitting. We also address the study of the origin and evolution of the corner states resulting from the bulk-edge-corner correspondence. The topological bowtie cavity studied in this work combines the virtues of topological systems and the extreme confinement offered by cavities with bowtie architecture, which enriches the study of corner states in sophisticated topological structures.

ABSTRACT: Non-Hermiticity alters band topology in the presence of loss and/or gain in topological systems, which not only introduces new definitions in topological classifications, topological invariants, and the bulk-boundary correspondence, but also gives rise to unprecedented applications such as topological insulator lasers. Most existing non-Hermitian topological systems derive their topological phases from Hermitian components, rather than being driven by non-Hermiticity itself. Here we report on the experimental observation of topological edge states induced solely by non-Hermiticity in an acoustic crystal. The acoustic crystal consists of a periodic one-dimensional chain of coupled acoustic resonators with tunable loss. In the Hermitian limit, or when the loss is negligible, the crystal exhibits no band gap and hosts no topological edge states. By introducing loss, we show that a band gap is induced, which can be either topological or trivial, depending on the loss configuration. In the topological case, topological edge modes are found inside the band gap. These results demonstrate that non-Hermiticity is able to drive a topological phase transition from a trivial system to a topological one, offering the possibilities for actively steerable topological wave manipulations in applications ranging from acoustics to photonics.

ABSTRACT: The multi-wavelength and tunable Yb3+:Ca3Y2(BO3)(4) solid-state lasers using topological insulator Bi2Te3 nanosheets as saturable absorber have been reported for the first time. A maximum output power of 161 mW with single pulse energy up to 1.09 mu J was achieved for the multi-wavelength condition. The corresponding shortest pulse duration and the largest repetition rate were 416 ns and 147.7 kHz, respectively. By further inserting an etalon to modulate the laser spectra, the Q-switched laser could be continuously tuned from 1027.9 to 1040.3 nm with a tuning range of 12.4 nm. At a fixed pump power of 5.09 W, it got a maximum output power and shortest pulse width at 1035 nm. This letter suggests that a topological insulator exhibits outstanding wideband saturable absorption properties because of its unique band structure of narrow bulk state and gapless surface state.

ABSTRACT: Second-order nonlinear optical (NLO) materials have important applications in the realms of photoelectronics and photonics whose microstructures need to be organized into a noncentrosymmetric (NCS) structure. In this work, a mixed-ligands three-dimensional (3D) noncentrosymmetric coordination polymer Zn(OBA)(DIB)center dot 0.5H(2)O (1) was hydrothermally prepared from 4, 4'-oxydibenzoic acid (H(2)OBA), 1, 3-di(1H-imidazol-1-yl)benzene (DIB) and Zn(NO3)(2)center dot 6H(2)O via spontaneous resolution approach, which crystallizes in a noncentrosymmetric space group Fdd2. Compound 1 was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric (TGA) and IR analyses. The structural analysis shows that 1 is a two-fold self-interpenetrated three-dimensional (3D) network material. Single crystal X-ray diffraction and the topological analysis manifests that the topological structure of 1 belongs to a cds topological net. The measurement of the fluorescent properties of 1 and the free DIB ligand show that the emission peak at 460 nm of 1 can be attributed to the charge transition from the. bond electron to the. anti-bond orbital of the DIB ligand. The second-harmonic generation (SHG) measurement shows that the second-order NLO effect of compound 1 is approximately equivalent to that of potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP). Compound 1 is high thermal stable and insoluble in water and common organic solvents, making it to be a potential candidate as a second-order NLO material.

ABSTRACT: Motivated by the experiment [St-Jean et al., Nat. Photonics 11, 651 (2017)] on topological phases with collective photon modes in a zigzag chain of polariton micropillars, we study spinless p-orbital fermions with local interorbital hoppings and repulsive interactions between p(x) and p(y) bands in zigzag optical lattices. We show that spinless p-band fermions in zigzag optical lattices can mimic the interacting Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and the effective transverse field Ising model in the presence of local hoppings. We analytically and numerically discuss the ground-state phases and quantum phase transitions of the model. This work provides a simple scheme to simulate topological phases and the quench dynamics of many-body systems in optical lattices.

ABSTRACT: Classical wave systems have constituted an excellent platform for emulating complex quantum phenomena, such as demonstrating topological phenomena in photonics and acoustics. Recently, a new class of topological states localized in more than one dimension of a D-dimensional system, referred to as higher-order topological (HOT) states, has been reported, offering an even more versatile platform to confine and control classical radiation and mechanical motion. Here, we design and experimentally study a 3D topological acoustic metamaterial supporting third-order (0D) topological corner states along with second-order (1D) edge states and first-order (2D) surface states within the same topological bandgap, thus establishing a full hierarchy of nontrivial bulk polarization--induced states in three dimensions. The assembled 3D topological metamaterial represents the acoustic analog of a pyrochlore lattice made of interconnected molecules, and is shown to exhibit topological bulk polarization, leading to the emergence of boundary states.

ABSTRACT: Topological physics exploits concepts from geometry and topology to implement systems capable of guiding waves in an unprecedented fashion. These ideas have led to the development of photonic topological insulators, which are optical systems whose eigenspectral topology allows the creation of light states that propagate along the edge of the system without any coupling into the bulk or backscattering even in the presence of disorder. Indeed, topological protection is a fully coherent effect, and it is not clear to what extent topological effects endure when the wavefronts become partially coherent. Here, we study the interplay of topological protection and the degree of spatial coherence of classical light propagating in disordered photonic topological insulators. Our results reveal the existence of a well-defined spectral window in which partially coherent light is topologically protected. This opens up the design space to a wider selection of light sources, possibly yielding smaller, cheaper, and more robust devices based on the topological transport of light.

ABSTRACT: Topological systems containing near-field or far-field couplings between unit cells have been widely investigated in quantum and classic systems. Their band structures are well explained with theories based on tight-binding or multiple scattering formalism. However, characteristics of the topology of the bulk bands based on the joint modulation of near-field and far-field couplings are rarely studied. Such hybrid systems are hardly realized in real systems and cannot be described by neither tight-binding nor multiple scattering theories. Here, we propose a hybrid-coupling photonic topological insulator based on a quasi-1D dimerized chain with the coexistence of near-field coupling within the unit cell and far-field coupling among all sites. Both theoretical and experimental results show that topological transition is realized by introducing near-field coupling for given far-field coupling conditions. In addition to closing and reopening the bandgap, the change in near-field coupling modulates the effective mass of photonics in the upper band from positive to negative, leading to an indirect bandgap, which cannot be achieved in conventional dimerized chains with either far-field or near-field coupling only.

ABSTRACT: We present a detailed analysis of topological binding and elastic interactions between a long, and micrometer-diameter fiber, and a microsphere in a homogeneously aligned nematic liquid crystal. Both objects are surface treated to produce strong perpendicular anchoring of the nematic liquid crystal. We use the opto-thermal micro-quench of the laser tweezers to produce topological defects with prescribed topological charge, such as pairs of a Saturn ring and an anti-ring, hyperbolic and radial hedgehogs on a fiber, as well as zero-charge loops. We study the entanglement and topological charge interaction between the topological defects of the fiber and sphere and we observe a huge variety of different entanglement topologies and defect-mediated elastic bindings. We explain all observed phenomena with simple topological rule: like topological charges repel each other and opposite topological charges attract. These binding mechanisms not only demonstrate the fascinating topology of nematic colloids, but also open a novel route to the assembly of very complex topological networks of fibers, spheres and other objects for applications in liquid crystal photonics.

ABSTRACT: The unrelated discoveries of quasicrystals and topological insulators have in turn challenged prevailing paradigms in condensed-matter physics. We find a surprising connection between quasicrystals and topological phases of matter: (i) quasicrystals exhibit nontrivial topological properties and (ii) these properties are attributed to dimensions higher than that of the quasicrystal. Specifically, we show, both theoretically and experimentally, that one-dimensional quasicrystals are assigned two-dimensional Chern numbers and, respectively, exhibit topologically protected boundary states equivalent to the edge states of a two-dimensional quantum Hall system. We harness the topological nature of these states to adiabatically pump light across the quasicrystal. We generalize our results to higher-dimensional systems and other topological indices. Hence, quasicrystals offer a new platform for the study of topological phases while their topology may better explain their surface properties.

ABSTRACT: The past decade has witnessed a booming development of topological photonics, which revolutionizes the methodology for controlling the behavior of light. A gigantic achievement is to engineer robust confined modes localized at interfaces between topologically distinct regions, where the optical context can trigger exotic topological phenomena exclusive to photons. Here, we provide an experimentally flexible approach to engineering topologically induced interface states in the visible regime via a unique design of complex superlattice formed by connecting two component superlattices of distinguished topological phases. Assisted by the intrinsic pseudospin degree due to the splitting between TM and TE polarized modes, we attain a precise manipulation of the spin-dependent topological interface states that can manifest themselves straightforwardly through transmission spectra. More specifically, since these topological localized modes stem from the hybridization of artificial photonic orbitals that are of topological origin as well, they are deemed a topological effect and thus named as the secondary topological interface states. Our work develops an innovative and productive strategy to tune topologically protected localized modes, based on which various applications such as selective local enhancement can be exploited.

ABSTRACT: Traditional photonic systems are endowed with brand new properties owing to the addition of topological physics with light. A conjugated topological cavity -states (CTCS) in one-dimensional photonic systems is presented, which has not only robust light transport but also ultra-high performances, such as high quality factor (high-Q) and perfect transmission. This extraordinary CTCS can address the bottleneck of typical topological photonic systems, which can only achieve robust light transport without maintaining high performance. Furthermore, the CTCS is especially suitable for bio-photonic sensing with high resolution requirements. An ultra-sensitivity of 2000 nm/RIU and a high-Q of 10(9) for detecting the concentra-tion of SARS-CoV-2 S-glycoprotein solution are obtained. Notably, the CTCS not only opens new possibilities for advanced photonics but also paves the way for high performance in topological photonic devices.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics provides a novel route for designing and realizing optical devices with unprecedented functionalities. Topological edge states, which are supported at the boundary of two photonic systems with different band topologies, enable robust light transport immune to structural imperfections and/or sharp bends in waveguides. Furthermore, the topological edge states are expected to revolutionize cavity-based optical devices such as lasers. Optical devices with built-in topological protection with a small footprint are fascinating as on-chip optical devices for low-loss and functional photonic integrated circuits. Semiconductor photonic crystals are promising platforms enabling the miniaturization of topological optical devices. Herein, we review the recent realizations of semiconductor topological photonic crystals. In particular, we discuss topological waveguides in valley photonic crystals, which have received increasing attention because of their simple realization. In addition, we provide recent demonstrations of topological nanocavities, which are another key component of topological nanophotonics. Progress in semiconductor topological photonic crystals will propel the use of topological photonic devices in various applications as well as deepen the understanding of topological photonic phenomena at the wavelength scale.

ABSTRACT: Topological edge solitons represent a significant research topic in the nonlinear topological photonics. They maintain their profiles during propagation, due to the joint action of lattice potential and nonlinearity, and at the same time are immune to defects or disorders, thanks to the topological protection. In the past few years topological edge solitons were reported in systems composed of helical waveguide arrays, in which the time-reversal symmetry is effectively broken. Very recently, topological valley Hall edge solitons have been demonstrated in straight waveguide arrays with the time-reversal symmetry preserved. However, these were scalar solitary structures. Here, for the first time, we report vector valley Hall edge solitons in straight waveguide arrays arranged according to the photonic lattice with innate type-II Dirac cones, which is different from the traditional photonic lattices with type-I Dirac cones such as honeycomb lattice. This comes about because the valley Hall edge state can possess both negative and positive dispersions, which allows the mixing of two different edge states into a vector soliton. Our results not only provide a novel avenue for manipulating topological edge states in the nonlinear regime, but also enlighten relevant research based on the lattices with type-II Dirac cones.

ABSTRACT: We experimentally demonstrate a two-dimensional topological differential microscopy based on the spin-orbit interaction of light through a thin uniaxial crystal slab. First, a three-dimensional propagation theory is established for the light propagating through a uniaxial material. Then it is found that, due to the spin-orbit interaction, the two circularly polarized components of incident light are imposed with opposite topological charges, leading to the azimuthal splitting of spin states. Consequently, the cross-polarized field approximately amounts to the second-order spatial differentiation of the incident field. Finally, such an optical differentiation performed by a lithium niobate crystal is successfully applied to edge detection in microscopy. Further experiments validate its good performance in edge enhancement of both amplitude and phase objects. The results provide an economic, simple but robust approach to real -time, colorful, and high-contrast biological imaging in living systems.

ABSTRACT: A new class of phenomena stemming from topological states of quantum matter has recently found a variety of analogies in classical systems. Spin-locking and one-way propagation have been shown to drastically alter scattering of electromagnetic waves, thus offering an unprecedented robustness to defects and disorder. Despite these successes, bringing these new ideas to practical grounds meets a number of serious limitations. In photonics, when it is crucial to implement topological photonic devices on a chip, two major challenges are associated with electromagnetic dissipation into heat and out-of-plane radiation into free space. Both these mechanisms may destroy the topological state and seriously affect the device performance. Here, we demonstrate experimentally that the topological order for light can be implemented in all-dielectric on-chip prototype metasurfaces, which mitigate the effect of Ohmic losses by using exclusively structured dielectric materials, and we reveal that coupling of the system to the radiative continuum does not affect topological properties. We demonstrate the spin-Hall effect of light for spinpolarized topological edge states through near-field spectroscopy measurements. Published under license by AIP Publishing.

ABSTRACT: Robustness against disorder and defects is a pivotal advantage of topological systems(1), manifested by the absence of electronic backscattering in the quantum-Hall(2) and spin-Hall effects(3), and by unidirectional waveguiding in their classical analogues(4,5). Two-dimensional (2D) topological insulators(4-13), in particular, provide unprecedented opportunities in a variety of fields owing to their compact planar geometries, which are compatible with the fabrication technologies used in modern electronics and photonics. Among all 2D topological phases, Chern insulators(14-25) are currently the most reliable designs owing to the genuine backscattering immunity of their non-reciprocal edge modes, brought via time-reversal symmetry breaking. Yet such resistance to fabrication tolerances is limited to fluctuations of the same order of magnitude as their bandgap, limiting their resilience to small perturbations only. Here we investigate the robustness problem in a system where edge transmission can survive disorder levels with strengths arbitrarily larger than the bandgap-an anomalous non-reciprocal topological network. We explore the general conditions needed to obtain such an unusual effect in systems made of unitary three-port non-reciprocal scatterers connected by phase links, and establish the superior robustness of anomalous edge transmission modes over Chern ones to phase-link disorder of arbitrarily large values. We confirm experimentally the exceptional resilience of the anomalous phase, and demonstrate its operation in various arbitrarily shaped disordered multi-port prototypes. Our results pave the way to efficient, arbitrary planar energy transport on 2D substrates for wave devices with full protection against large fabrication flaws or imperfections. The physics of oriented topological graphs produces anomalous non-reciprocal topological edge states that have greater robustness to disorder and defects than the best performers at present: namely, Chern states.

ABSTRACT: We study the magnetic topological transition of the isofrequency curves in the wave vector space from a closed ellipsoid to an open hyperboloid in a metamaterial based on artificial transmission lines. In the radio frequency band we directly measure the emission pattern of a point source placed in the center of the lattice and demonstrate the elliptical wave fronts below the topological transition frequency and hyperbolic wave fronts above the topological transition frequency.

ABSTRACT: Recently, 3D photonic Weyl degeneracies have been realized in both magnetized plasma (MP) and chiral hyperbolic metamaterials (CHM). Both systems can achieve backscattering-immune transportation of light across sharp corners of translation-invariant prisms and they also show similar equal-frequency surfaces (EFSs). Despite this resemblance, their topological properties show striking differences as the Weyl points in MP and CHM arise from broken time-reversal and spatial-inversion symmetries, respectively. Here, using the effective medium approach, an interface formed between an MP and a CHM is investigated, which supports two Fermi arc surface states with nearly identical propagation directions. This leads to novel 3D interface configurations for guiding non-reciprocal surface waves, information multiplexing, and magnetically controllable routing of the signal. This work may find applications in unidirectional excitation and controllable transportation in photonics.

ABSTRACT: Recently, higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs), accompanied by topologically nontrivial boundary states with a codimension larger than one, have been extensively explored because of unconventional bulk-boundary correspondences. As a novel type of HOTIs, very recent works have explored the square-root HOTIs, where the topologically nontrivial nature of bulk bands stems from the square of the Hamiltonian. In this paper, 2D square-root HOTIs are experimentally demonstrated in photonic waveguide arrays written in glass using femtosecond laser direct-write techniques. Edge and corner states are clearly observed at visible light spectra. The dynamical evolutions of topological boundary states are experimentally demonstrated, which verify the existence of photonic corner states in two band gaps. The symmetry-protected corner states in the photonic square-root HOTI may have potential applications in information processing and lasing.

ABSTRACT: Finite-size effect plays a significant role in topology photonics not to mention in reality all experimental setups are in finite-size. A photonic bandgap is opened in the topological edge state dispersion if a topological photonic crystal with finite width is considered, and the bandgap size relies on the finite-size effect. Pseudospin-preserving and pseudospin-flipping processes can be realized when a selectively switch of the pseudospin of edge states are customized by our designs. Our microwave experiments also successfully demonstrate pseudospin switch-on and -off behaviors in a finite-width photonic crystal. By combining photonic crystals with finite widths, a multi-tunneling proposal of topological photonic crystals can also be achieved. Our study of the finite-size effect will provide new approaches and thoughts to improve the development of topological photonic devices in the future.

ABSTRACT: We propose a two-dimensional photonic crystal that possesses a degenerate ring in the momentum space. The photonic crystal is composed of the parallel-plate metal filled with a periodically arranged square array of metallic cylinders. Opening an air gap breaks the z-inversion symmetry, leading to the modes coupling (bi-anisotropy response) of TE and TM waves. This induced electric-magneto coupling, a similar role of the spin-orbit interaction in the condensed matters, results in a complete topological band gap around the degenerate frequency. The bulk bands below the band gap take non-zero Z(2) topological invariant characterized by the evolution of the Berry phase. As a consequence, the interface of two photonic crystals with opposite bi-anisotropy supports topological protected edge states that exhibit one-way propagation and are highly resistant to disorders. Our work might be very useful for the design of topological photonic crystals and may serve as a platform for studying pseudo-spin photonics.

ABSTRACT: All-optical control of terahertz pulses is essential for the development of optoelectronic devices for next-generation quantum technologies. Despite substantial research in THz generation methods, polarization control remains difficult. Here, we demonstrate that by exploiting band structure topology, both helicity-dependent and helicityindependent THz emission can be generated from nanowires of the topological Dirac semimetal Cd3As2. We show that narrowband THz pulses can be generated at oblique incidence by driving the system with optical (1.55 eV) pulses with circular polarization. Varying the incident angle also provides control of the peak emission frequency, with peak frequencies spanning 0.21-1.40 THz as the angle is tuned from 15 to 45 degrees. We therefore present Cd3As2 nanowires as a promising novel material platform for controllable terahertz emission.

ABSTRACT: In silicon photonics, the cavity mode is a fundamental mechanism to design integrated passive devices for on-chip optical information processing. Recently, the corner state in a second-order topological photonic crystal (PC) rendered a global method to achieve an intrinsic cavity mode. It is crucial to explore such a topological corner state in silicon photonic integrated circuits (PICs) under in-plane excitation. Here, we study both theoretically and experimentally the topological nanophotonic corner state in a silicon-on-insulator PC cavity at a telecommunications wavelength. In theory, the expectation values of a mirror-flip operation for the Bloch modes of a PC slab are used to characterize the topological phase. Derived from topologically distinct bulk polarizations of two types of dielectric-vein PCs, the corner state is induced in a 90-deg-bend interface, localizing at the corner point of real space and the Brillouin zone boundary of reciprocal space. To implement in-plane excitation in an experiment, we fabricate a cross-coupled PC cavity based on the bend interface and directly image the corner state near 1383 nm using a far-field microscope. Finally, by means of the temporal coupled-mode theory, the intrinsic Q factor of a cross-coupled cavity (about 8000) is retrieved from the measured transmission spectra. This work gives deterministic guidance and potential applications for cavity-mode-based passive devices in silicon PICs, such as optical filters, routers, and multiplexers.

ABSTRACT: Photonic analogs of electronic systems with topologically non-trivial behavior such as unidirectional scatter-free propagation has tremendous potential for transforming photonic systems. Like in electronics topological behavior can be observed in photonics for systems either preserving time-reversal (TR) symmetry or explicitly breaking it. TR symmetry breaking requires magneto-optic photonics crystals (PC) or generation of synthetic gauge fields. For on-chip photonics that operate at optical frequencies both are quite challenging because of poor magneto-optic response of materials or substantial nanofabrication challenges in generating synthetic gauge fields. A recent work by Ma, et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 223901 (2015)] based on preserving pseudo TR symmetry offers a promising design scheme for observing unidirectional edge states in a modified honeycomb photonic crystal ( PC) lattice of circular rods that offers encouraging alternatives. Here we propose through bandstructure calculations the inverse system of modified honeycomb PC of circular holes in a dielectric membrane which is more attractive from fabrication standpoint for on-chip applications. We observe trivial and non-trivial bandgaps as well as unidirectional edge states of opposite helicity propagating in opposite directions at the interface of a trivial and nontrivial PC structures. Around 1550nm operating wavelength similar to 55nm of bandwidth is possible for practicable values of design parameters (lattice constant, hole radii, membrane thickness, scaling factor etc.) and robust to reasonable variations in those parameters.

ABSTRACT: We construct a generalized system by introducing an additional long-range hopping to the well-known Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. This system exhibits richer topological properties including non-trivial topological phases and associated localized edge states. We study the zero-energy edge states in detail and derive the edge-state wave functions using two different methods. Furthermore, we propose a possible setup using octupole moments optically excited on an array of dielectric particles for the realization of the system, and by adjusting the coupling strengths between neighboring particles we can control the hotspots (near-field enhancement) in such structures.

ABSTRACT: Quantum emitters interacting with photonic band-gap materials lead to the appearance of qubit-photon bound states that mediate decoherence-free, tunable emitter-emitter interactions. Recently, it has been shown that when these band gaps have a topological origin, like in the photonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, these qubit-photon bound states feature chiral shapes and certain robustness to disorder. In this paper, we consider a more general situation where the emitters interact with an extended SSH photonic model with longer-range hoppings that displays a richer phase diagram than its nearest-neighbor counterpart, e.g., phases with larger winding numbers. In particular, we first study the features of the qubit-photon bound states when the emitters couple to the bulk modes in the different phases, discern their connection with the topological invariant, and show how to further tune their shape through the use of giant atoms, i.e., nonlocal couplings. Then, we consider the coupling of emitters to the edge modes appearing in the different topological phases. Here, we show that giant-atom dynamics can distinguish between all different topological phases, in contrast to the case with local couplings. Finally, we provide a possible experimental implementation of the model based on periodic modulations of circuit QED systems. Our paper enriches the understanding of the interplay between topological photonics and quantum optics.

ABSTRACT: In topological photonics, there is a class of designing approaches that usually tunes topological phase from trivial to non-trivial in a magneto-optical photonic crystal by applying an external magnetic field to break time reversal symmetry. Here we theoretically realize topological phase transition by rotating square gym-electric rods with broken time reversal symmetry. By calculating band structures and Chem numbers, in a simple square-lattice photonic crystal, we demonstrate the topological phase transition at a specific orientation angle of the rods. Based on the dependence of topological phase on the orientation angle, we propose several terahertz. devices including an isolator, circulator and splitter in a 50x50 reconfigurable rod army by locally controlling topological phases of the rods. These results may have potential applications in producing reconfigurable terahertz topological devices.

ABSTRACT: The development of terahertz integrated circuits is vital for realizing sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication, high-speed on-chip interconnects, high-resolution imaging, on-chip biosensors, and fingerprint chemical detection. Nonetheless, the existing terahertz on-chip devices suffer from reflection, and scattering losses at sharp bends or defects. Recently discovered topological phases of light endow the photonics devices with extraordinary properties, such as reflectionless propagation and robustness against impurities or defects, which is vital for terahertz integrated devices. Leveraging the robustness of topological edge states combined with a low-loss silicon platform is poised to offer a remarkable performance of the terahertz devices providing a breakthrough in the field of terahertz integrated circuits and high-speed interconnects. In this Perspective, we present a brief outlook of various terahertz functional devices enabled by a photonic topological insulator that will pave the path for augmentation of complementary metal oxide semiconductor compatible terahertz technologies, essential for accelerating the vision of 6G communication and beyond to enable ubiquitous connectivity and massive digital cloning of physical and biological worlds.

ABSTRACT: We demonstrate via three examples that topological insulators (TI) offer a new platform for plasmonics. First, we show that the collective excitations of a thin slab of a TI display spin charge separation. This gives rise to purely charge-like optical and purely spin-like acoustic plasmons, respectively. Second, we argue that the depletion layer mixes Dirac and Schrodinger electrons, which can lead to novel features such as high modulation depths and interband plasmons. The analysis is based on an extension of the usual formula for optical plasmons that depends on the slab width and on the dielectric constant of the TI. Third, we discuss the coupling of the TI surface phonons to the plasmons and find strong hybridization especially for samples with large slab widths.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics has attracted extensive attention, since it allows for a platform to explore and exploit versatile nano-optics systems. In particular, the ideal Weyl metamaterials have recently been demonstrated with fascinating phenomena such as chiral zero mode and negative refraction. In this work, we apply the photonic Weyl metamateirals into the optical tweezers. Based on the effective medium approach, the optical force generated by the body state of the Weyl metamaterial is systematically investigated. Interestingly, theoretical results show that for oblique incidence, the optical force spectra present a valley around Weyl frequency with zero magnitude exactly at the Weyl frequency, and the forces show strong optical circular dichroism. In addition, due to the bi-anisotropic properties, transmissions through the Weyl metamaterial exhibit a significant linear-to-circular polarization conversion and the transmitted wavefront acquires spin momenta of photons, which induces abnormal force on chiral particles. Our study may provide potential applications in the optical manipulations, polarization conversions, and wavefront engineering optics.

ABSTRACT: Topological interface states are currently attracting fast-growing attention in classical wave systems. However, little work has been done on the topological interface states in one-dimensional (1D) elastic wave systems, especially in the case of oblique incidence. This paper theoretically demonstrates the realization of topological interface states of elastic waves in a 1D composite structure composed of two phononic crystals (PCs) with different topological characteristics, which can be regulated by the incident angle. For the out-of-plane SH mode, multiple topological interface states can coexist in different common bandgaps. For the in-plane complex P-SV coupled mode, topological interface states can exist in both partial-polarization  and omni-polarization  bandgaps. All these topological interface states exist in wide incident angle regions. The polarization and the mode conversion of the interface states have also been discussed. Our results provide an innovative method to excite and tune topologically protected interface states for elastic waves, which may have potential applications in obtaining strong local vibration for different polarized elastic wave modes.

ABSTRACT: We have theoretically designed and experimentally observed free-space propagation of topological singular lines of cylindrical vector optical fields with non-integer topological charges. The polarization singular lines are due to the orientation uncertainty of the polarization states, caused by non-integer topological charges. The results reveal that during propagation, evolution of the polarization singular lines results in the special intensity pattern, distribution of polarization states, and chains of polarization singularities. We have also proposed a method to generate triple straight and spiral singular lines, which may contribute to the research of complex optical fields. (C) 2019 Chinese Laser Press

ABSTRACT: Hyperbolic medium is a special class of strongly anisotropic materials described by diagonal permittivity tensor with the principal components being of the opposite signs, which results in a hyperbolic shape of isofrequency contours. These media support propagating electromagnetic waves with extremely large wave vectors exhibiting unique optical properties and applications such as negative refraction, subwavelength imaging, radiative heat transfer manipulation, enhancing spontaneous emission rate (Purcell factor), biosensing, and nanoscale light confinement. Hyperbolic metamaterials have been experimentally realized for optical, infrared, and microwave frequency ranges. For the terahertz (THz) frequency range, graphene-based and bismuth-based media are only theoretically predicted to have a hyperbolic dispersion relation. Herein, the experimental evidence of such dispersion in bismuth-dielectric materials at THz frequencies is shown. THz waveforms transmitted through ultrathin bismuth film/dielectric substrate structures are measured and the negative time delay caused by transition between the elliptic and hyperbolic dispersion at bismuth thickness increase is revealed. In the hyperbolic regime, the switching between effective near-zero and negative refractive index regime is demonstrated, which depends on the bismuth film thickness and dielectric substrate optical properties. The outcomes demonstrate the possibility for realizing easy planar hyperbolic media for THz photonics, sensing, imaging, and communication systems.

ABSTRACT: For a partially coherent Laguerre-Gaussian (PCLG) vortex beam, information regarding the topological charge (TC) is concealed in the cross-spectral density (CSD) function phase. Herein, a flexible method for the simultaneous determination of the sign and magnitude of the TC for a PCLG vortex beam is proposed based on the measured CSD amplitude and phase after the beam propagates through a dual cylindrical lens with adjustable angles. Both the stripes in the CSD amplitude and phase exhibit quantitative relationships with the value of TC, that is, N=2|L|+1. Meanwhile, the angle adjustability of cylindrical lenses allows flexible measurements, thus rendering the scheme effective for both high and extreme coherences.

ABSTRACT: We investigate topological nonlinear optics with spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensate in a cavity. The cavity is driven by a pump laser and a weak probe laser. Both lasers excite Bose-Einstein condensate, in the presence of standard Raman process for spin-orbit coupling, to an intermediate storage level. We theoretically show that the quantum interference at the transitional pathways of dressed atomic states results in different types of optical transparencies, which get completely inverted in atomic damping induced gain regime. The synthetic pseudo-spin states also implant different phases in the probe field forcing modes in probe transparencies to form gapless Dirac cones, which become gapped in presence of Raman detuning. These features get interestingly enhanced in gain regime where the amplified part of probe transparencies appear as gapless topological edge-like states between the probe bulk modes and cause non-trivial phase transition. We illustrate that the nonlinear interactions of the pseudo-spin states also enhance the slow light features in probe transmission. The manipulation of dressed states for topological optical transparencies in our findings could be a crucial step towards topological photonics and their application in quantum computation.

ABSTRACT: "As a new topological phase in three-dimensional momentum space, Weyl semimetals extend the repertoire of exotic topological states. In this paper, we find the existence of photonic Weyl points in electromagnetic continuous gyromagnetic metamaterials. The dispersion of the longitudinal mode of one of the two bands forming the Weyl point is flat  thus, the Weyl degeneracy point of the system is exactly at the critical transition between the type-I and type-II Weyl points. The Fermi arc connects the projections of the Weyl points with opposite chirality at the interface between the gyromagnetic metamaterial and vacuum. Full-wave simulation results show that surface waves can bypass sharp defects and achieve robust, unidirectional optical transmission without reflection. Furthermore, taking the spatial nonlocal effects into account, the ideal type-I Weyl points can exist in this class of metamaterials. This paper sheds light on fundamental understanding of topological physics, and the study of Weyl points in metamaterials will greatly enrich the field of topological photonics."

ABSTRACT: It is experimentally verified that nonreciprocal photonic systems with continuous translation symmetry may have an ill-defined topology. The topological classification of such systems is only feasible when the material response is regularized with a spatial-frequency cutoff. We experimentally demonstrate that adjoining a small air layer to the relevant material interface may effectively imitate an idealized spatial cutoff that suppresses the nonreciprocal response for short wavelengths and regularizes the topology. Furthermore, it is experimentally verified that nonreciprocal systems with an ill-defined topology may be used to abruptly halt the energy flow in a unidirectional waveguide due to the violation of the bulk-edge correspondence. In particular, we report the formation of an energy sink that absorbs the incoming electromagnetic waves with a large field enhancement at the singularity.

ABSTRACT: Two-dimensional electron gas systems (2DEGs) generated at the oxide interfaces that exhibit rich physics phenomena opened up an era for oxide-based electronics, photonics, and spintronics. The recent discovery of superconductivity plus the strong spin-orbital coupling naturally existing in the 2DEGs of KTaO3 (KTO) made KTO an exciting platform for the interplay of the electronic and spin degrees of freedom to create exotic physical properties. By directly placing KTO's 2DEGs next to another strongly-correlated oxide with nontrivial topological nodes, we reveal the anomalous effects which were induced by the topological states in the electronic transport properties of the KTO's 2DGEs, due to the electronic reconstruction caused by the proximity effect. This adds an additional prospect to the functions of KTO heterostructures.

ABSTRACT: Topological insulators and topological superconductors are distinguished by their bulk phase transitions and gapless states at a sharp boundary with the vacuum. Quasicrystals have recently been found to be topologically nontrivial. In quasicrystals, the bulk phase transitions occur in the same manner as standard topological materials, but their boundary phenomena are more subtle. In this Letter we directly observe bulk phase transitions, using photonic quasicrystals, by constructing a smooth boundary between topologically distinct one-dimensional quasicrystals. Moreover, we use the same method to experimentally confirm the topological equivalence between the Harper and Fibonacci quasicrystals. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.110.076403

ABSTRACT: In this work, we study several different vector and hybrid light fields, including those with multiple polarization singularities. We derive polarization singularity indices by adopting a wellknown M.V. Berry's formula, which is commonly used to obtain the topological charge of scalar vortex light fields. It is shown that fields whose polarization state depends only on the polar angle in the beam cross section can have either polarization singularity lines outgoing from the center, or a single polarization singularity in the center of the beam cross section. If the polarization state of the field depends only on the radial variable, then such fields have no polarization singularities and their index is equal to zero. If the polarization state of a vector field depends on both polar coordinates, then such a field can have several polarization singularities at different locations in the beam cross section. We also investigate a vector field with high-order radial polarization and with a real parameter. At different values of this parameter, such a field has either several polarization singularity lines outgoing from the center, or a single singular point in the center. The polarization singularity index of such a field for different parameters can be either half- integer, or integer, or zero.

ABSTRACT: "Optical microcavities can trap light within both spatial and temporal dimensions, giving rise to an enhancement of lightmatter interaction, which are employed extensively for fundamental studies of optical physics and photonic applications. In particular, because of its ultrahigh-Q factors and small mode volumes, optical whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) microcavities, confining light by total internal reflection, act as the frontier of the state-of-art microcavity studies. As the recent significant development of the micro-/nano-fabrication technology for semiconductor chips and optical materials, on-chip integration becomes one of the most important trends for WGM microcavities. For example, on-chip optical microcavities have been playing a pivotal role in diverse fields, including photonic chip, broadband integrated optical computing, on-chip optical interconnects, microcomb-based precise measurement, etc. In this review, we introduce the research advances of microlasers, nonlinear optics, photonic integrated circuits, and ultrasensitive optical sensing in ultrahigh-Q on-chip microcavities. The specific progresses are organized as follows: (1) Ultralow-threshold lasing in on-chip WGM microcavity can be achieved by either introducing active materials to the resonator or using intrinsic nonlinearities of the resonator material. Moreover, diverse functional microlasers are also realized, such as unidirectional emission, chaotic laser, symmetry-broken laser, orbit angular momentum laser, parity-time reversal symmetry laser, etc. (2) Numerous optical nonlinear effects with high efficiency have been experimentally generated in WGM microcavities, including second harmonic generation, fourwave mixing, stimulated Brillouin scattering, stimulated Raman scattering. Furthermore, high-performance and multifunctional photonic applications have been developed based on microcavity-engineered nonlinear optics. In particular, optical frequency combs based on Kerr nonlinear effects in WGM microcavities, are applied extensively for integrated precision measurement applications like ultrafast LiDAR, optical clocks, and astronomical spectrum calibration. (3) As one of the most important elements in photonic integrated circuit, the optical microcavity has been widely used in the realization of photonic functional devices, such as signal sources, storage, filter, isolator, and modulator. Moreover, it also has been applied to broadband coupling between individual photonic devices. (4) WGM microcavity sensing attracts much attention due to ultra-high sensitivity and label-free nature. The last decade has witnessed the tremendous progress of on-chip microcavity sensing, and the sensing ability has been widely exploited for detecting single nanoparticles, biological molecules, magnetic fields, angular velocity, temperature, etc. Finally, we provide an outlook on the future developments of on-chip ultrahigh-Q microcavity photonics. While numerous progresses have been achieved in ultrahigh-Q on-chip microcavities, a few challenges and obstacles still exist in practical applications. For example, the optical soliton microcombs suffer from the low conversion efficiency and limited wavelength bandwidth  the bandwidth of the optical isolator by the optical microcavities is narrow  the electro-optic modulator based on microcavities cannot combine the broad modulation bandwidth and low power consumption  it is highly challenging for the specific identification in microcavity biosensing. In order to further push forward the development of on-chip microcavity photonics, new principles, new mechanisms, and new materials are required to be explored. The considerable solution may focus on the non-trivial interaction in complex systems, such as hybrid microcavity structures, regulation of optical field by multiple nonlinear optical effects, optical wave chaos in asymmetric microcavities, non-Hermitian physics, and topological photonics."

ABSTRACT: Topological insulators having topologically protected metallic surface state emerged out as new building blocks in electronics and photonics. In this paper, a high figure of merit (FOM) fiber optic surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor employing topological insulator, Bi1.5Sb0.5Te1.8Se1.2, is proposed theoretically. The designed SPR sensor utilizes wavelength interrogation-based Kretschmann-Raether configuration to evaluate the transmitted power using transfer matrix method. Maximum FOM achieved was 360.16 RIU-1 for the fiber configuration having 20-layers of Bi1.5Sb0.5Te1.8Se1.2 coated over thin silver film. The performance of the sensor is also evaluated in terms of sensitivity and detection accuracy values. Authors believe that the derived results with enhanced performance can significantly boost the potential applications of topological insulators and hence BSTS material can find propitious chemical and biological sensing applications in future.

ABSTRACT: We report on the generation of large energy, widely wavelength tunable pulses in an erbium-doped fiber laser passively Q-switched by a topological insulator saturable absorber (TI-SA). The TI-SA is prepared through an optical deposition method. Its saturating intensity and modulation depth are measured to be about 57 MW/cm(2) and 22%, respectively. We show that the high modulation depth of TI-SA allows the generation of stable Q-switched pulses with per-pulse energy up to 1.5 mu J and its broadband saturable absorption favors the tunable Q-switching operation from 1510.9 nm to 1589.1 nm. Our study suggests that TI: Bi2Te3 could be a promising saturable absorber for both the high energy and broadband optical applications.

ABSTRACT: One-dimensional models with topological band structures represent a simple and versatile platform to demonstrate novel topological concepts. Herewe experimentally study topologically protected states in silicon at the interface between two dimer chains with differentZak phases. Furthermore, we propose anddemonstrate that, in a system where topological and trivial defect modes coexist, we can probe them independently. Tuning the configurationof theinterface, weobserve thetransitionbetweena single topologicaldefectandacompoundtrivial defect state. These results provide a new paradigmfor topologically protectedwaveguiding in a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor compatible platform and highlight the novel concept of isolating topological and trivial defect modes in the same system that can have important implications in topological physics.

ABSTRACT: Transport in a non-Hermitian trimerized lattice with one lossy site per unit cell exhibits a quantized mean displacement before decay characterized by a two-step phase transition from zero to unity through a fractional value. Such a peculiar behavior, sensitive to both the lattice parameters and the initial state, is shown to be closely related to the presence of two nondegenerate dark states decoupled from the lossy sites and correspond to two staggered band closing points. We further check that distinct topological phases can also be characterized by the total Zak phase and by the number of midgap edge states. Moreover, we demonstrate that the edge states are topologically protected and their localization can be controlled via the couplings imbalance. Our results are expected to be relevant for implementations of topological photonics such as those based on arrays of evanescently coupled waveguides.

ABSTRACT: Replacing some Bi with In in Bi2Se3 transforms it from a topological insulator to a band insulator. Here, we have used time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy to investigate photoexcited carrier dynamics in (Bi1-xInx)(2)Se-3 films with indium concentration x = 0%, 25%, and 50%. In Bi2Se3, optically excited carriers scatter from the bulk conduction band states into high mobility topological surface states within picoseconds after excitation. We demonstrate that a second set of Dirac surface states, located similar to 1.5-1.8 eV above the conduction band minimum and accessible to carriers excited by 3.1 eV pulses, is characterized by a higher mobility than the surface states within the band gap that dominate equilibrium conductivity. In (Bi0.75In0.25)(2)Se-3 and (Bi0.50In0.50)(2)Se-3, which are insulating without photoexcitation, the dynamics of photoexcited free carriers are affected by the twin domain boundaries and are sensitive to the disorder introduced by indium substitution. Transient conductivity rise time, as well as the mobility and lifetime of the photoexcited carriers in (Bi1-xInx)(2)Se-3 films, can be tuned by the indium content, enabling tailoring of band insulators that have the desired optoelectronic properties and are fully structurally compatible with the topological insulator Bi2Se3 for applications in high-speed photonic devices based on topological insulator/band insulator heterostructures.

ABSTRACT: We report the first experimental study upon the optical trapping and manipulation of topological insulator (TI) particles. By virtue of the unique TI properties, which have a conducting surface and an insulating bulk, the particles present a peculiar behavior in the presence of a single laser beam optical tweezers: they oscillate in a plane perpendicular to the direction of the laser propagation. In other words, TI particles behave as optically induced oscillators, allowing dynamical measurements with unprecedented simplicity and purely optical control. Actually, optical rheology of soft matter interfaces and biological membranes, as well as dynamical force measurements in macromolecules and biopolymers, may be quoted as feasible possibilities for the near future.

ABSTRACT: An in-band pumped 1.645-mu m Er:YAG ceramic laser passively Q-switched by a topological insulator: Bi2Te3 saturable absorber is reported.

ABSTRACT: We first reported that the topological insulator (TI) nanosheets solution filled in photonic crystal fiber can operate as an effective saturable absorber (SA) with the merits of low-insertion loss (similar to 0.42 dB), long interaction length (> 10 cm), and high-power tolerance. This SA device exhibited a saturable intensity of 14.9 MW/cm(2), modulation depth of 19.1%, and nonsaturable loss of 25% at 1060 nm. Upo employing, this device rendered us to establish an ytterbium-doped all-fiber laser oscillator, where stable evanescent wave mode-locking operation has been achieved. This letter provided a new way of utilizing the unique nonlinear optical property of TI.

ABSTRACT: "Photonic topological insulators have recently received widespread attention mainly due to their ability to provide directions in the development of photonic integration platforms. The proposal for a topological bulk cavity with a single-mode expands upon previous research works on topological cavities  thus, interest in topological edge states and corner states is beginning to shift into analysis on bulk properties and their applications. However, there remains a gap in research on a multi-mode cavity of the topological photonic crystals (PCs). In this Letter, a cavity of the topological PCs is proposed involving pair-partitioned bulk localized states (BLSs) from a two-dimensional inner and outer nested square lattice (2D IONSL), which can enable a multi-mode cavity for the topological PCs. First, the topological characteristics are described in terms of a Zak phase, and band inversions are achieved by changing the size of scatterers in the inner and outer circles that reside within the unit cell. Afterwards, analogous to the tight-binding model for electronic systems, the Hamiltonian and topological phase transition conditions of 2D IONSL PCs are derived. Furthermore, it is proposed that the demonstrated optical field reflection and confinement mechanism induced by topological band inversions due to the opposite parities of wavefunctions may lead to the phenomenon of pair-partitioned BLSs. This research increases the research works of bulk topological effects, creating a route for photonic integration platforms for near-infrared."

ABSTRACT: The combination of topological photonics and quantum optics has promising applications. In previous works, the role of the edge states of conventional topological optical structure in the coherent coupling between atoms has been discussed. Besides the optimistic results, we find that if the coupling coefficient between the atom and element-cavity exceeds the coupling coefficient between cavities in the array, atoms cannot be effectively coupled with each other through the edge states. Here, we generalize to higher-order structures and explore the dynamics of three atoms interacting with the cavity array based on the kagome-type optically coupled-cavity array with topologically protected corner states. Three atoms are theoretically coupled in three corner cavities, and various quantum behaviors can be displayed in different parameters. It is shown that three atoms mediated by the corner state can be coherently coupled with each other, without the constraint of the coupling coefficient, and can induce entanglement, which shows that the high-order topological optical structure has more advantages than the con-ventional topological optical structure in coherent coupling among qubits. In addition, we also studied atoms mediated by edge states. The results show that the atoms mediated by edge states can be coherently coupled only in the weak coupling regime, and the entanglement effect induced by the edge states is not as good as that of the corner state. It indicates that the corner state is more useful than the edge state in the second-order optical topological structure. Our results can offer references for applying optical topological structure in quantum computing and quantum communication.(c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group

ABSTRACT: The rapid development of topological photonics has significantly revolutionized our comprehension of electromagnetic wave manipulation in recent decades. Recent research exploiting large-area topological states inserts an additional gapless PC structure between topologically trivial and non-trivial PCs, effectively introducing the mode width degree of freedom. Nevertheless, these heterostructures mainly sup-port only single-type waveguide states operating within a single frequency band. To address these limitations, we propose a novel, to the best of our knowledge, tri-band three -layer heterostructure system, supporting both large-area pseudospin-and valley-locked states. The system showcases tunable mode widths with different operational bandwidths. Moreover, the heterostructures exhibit inherent topological characteristics and reflection-free interfacing, which are verified in the well-designed Z-shaped channels. The proposed heterostructure system can be used to design multi-band multi-functional high-flexibility topological devices, providing great advantages for enlarging the on-chip integrated communication systems.(c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group

ABSTRACT: Electromagnetic waves propagating in conventional wave-guiding structures are reflected by discontinuities and decay in lossy regions. In this Letter, we drastically modify this typical guided-wave behavior by combining concepts from non-Hermitian physics and topological photonics. To this aim, we theoretically study, for the first time, the possibility of realizing an exceptional point between coupled topological modes in a non-Hermitian nonreciprocal waveguide. Our proposed system is composed of oppositely biased gyrotropic materials (e.g., biased plasmas or graphene layers) with a balanced distribution of loss and gain. To study this complex wave-guiding problem, we put forward an exact analysis based on classical Green's function theory, and we elucidate the behavior of coupled topological modes and the nature of their non-Hermitian degeneracies. We find that, by operating near an exceptional point, we can realize anomalous topological wave propagation with, at the same time, low group velocity, inherent immunity to backscattering at discontinuities, and immunity to losses. These theoretical findings may open exciting research directions and stimulate further investigations of non-Hermitian topological waveguides to realize robust wave propagation in practical scenarios.

ABSTRACT: We investigate the topological edge modes in a rhombic waveguide array with imaginary coupling, which is realized by incorporating auxiliary waveguide between the coupled waveguides. By suitably tuning both real and imaginary couplings to generate an effective pi flux, a non-Hermitian analog of Aharonov-Bohm (AB) cage is formed as the band structures become flat and coalesce into third-order exceptional points (EPs). We show the array can support gapped topological edge modes, which can be explained by mapping the system Hamiltonian into the square root of an anti-parity-time (PT) -symmetric waveguide array. In contrast to the linear power increase of bulk modes, the propagation of edge modes can be conserved or exponentially amplified depending on which termination is initially excited. Our study provides a promising way to realizing robust light propagation.

ABSTRACT: Valley photonic crystal (VPhC) waveguides have attracted much attention because of their ability to enable robust light propagation against sharp bends. However, their demonstration using a CMOS-compatible process suitable for mass production has not yet been reported at the telecom wavelengths. Here, by tailoring the photomask to suppress the optical proximity effect, VPhC patterns comprising equilateral triangular holes were successfully fabricated using photolithography. We optically characterized the fabricated VPhC devices using microscopic optics with NIR imaging. For comparison, we also fabricated and characterized line-defect W1 PhC waveguides, in which the transmission intensities decreased at some regions within the operating bandwidth when sharp turns were introduced into the waveguide. In contrast, the developed VPhC waveguides can robustly propagate light around the C-band telecommunication wavelengths, even in the presence of sharp bends. Our results highlight the potential of VPhC waveguides as an interconnection technology in silicon topological photonic ICs.

ABSTRACT: We prove that a suitable correlation between system parameters can trigger topological phase transitions and flat bands in a multistrand Creutz ladder network when a staggered second neighbor interaction is included along the x axis. An appropriate change of basis maps such a finite N-strand mesh into N or N - 1 decoupled SuSchrieffer-Heeger chains, depending on N even or odd. A simple intuitive method, using a real-space decimation scheme, turns out to be very powerful in analytically extracting the flat bands, explaining their degeneracy, or a lifting of same. Our results are analytically exact and may inspire experiments in photonics and ultracold atomic systems.

ABSTRACT: The Fano resonance with a distinctive ultra-sharp, asymmetric line shape and high quality factor, is a widely occurring phenomena, that has a large variety of optical, plasmonic and microwave manifestations. In this paper, we explore the characteristic robustness of a Fano resonance mode, which is topologically protected by engineering a band inversion, induced by breaking the mirror symmetry of a two-dimensional honeycomb photonic crystal (HPC), associated with C-6 point group symmetry. Dark and bright topological edge modes appear in the band gap which arise when Dirac cone is opened up. Destructive and constructive interference of the dark and bright modes leads to the asymmetric line shape of the Fano resonance. The Fano resonance is very sensitive to the material changes and structural perturbations. This property can be applied to obtain new sensor designs. Here we demonstrate that the topological Fano resonance mode preserves its asymmetric, ultra-sharp line shape in the presence of the disorder, defects and cavities.The stability of the Fano resonance mode has useful optical device applications such as in low threshold lasers, and extremely precise interferometers.

ABSTRACT: Here the authors develop topological polarization singular lasers that feature paired radiation channels carrying distinct topological properties which leads to single mode lasing with high external quantum efficiency. Bound states in the continuum (BICs) in photonic crystals describe the originally leaky Bloch modes that can become bounded when their radiation fields carry topological polarization singularities. However, topological polarization singularities do not carry energy to far field, which limits radiation efficiencies of BICs for light emitting applications. Here, we demonstrate a topological polarization singular laser which has a topological polarization singular channel in the second Brillouin zone and a paired linearly polarized radiation channel in the first Brillouin zone. The presence of the singular channel enables the lasing mode with a higher quality factor than other modes for single mode lasing. In the meanwhile, the presence of the radiation channel secures the lasing mode with high radiation efficiency. The demonstrated topological polarization singular laser operates at room temperature with an external quantum efficiency exceeding 24%. Our work presents a new paradigm in eigenmode engineering for mode selection, exotic field manipulation and lasing.

ABSTRACT: Skyrmions are topologically stable quasiparticles that have been predicted and demonstrated in quantum fields, solid-state physics and magnetic materials, but only recently observed in electromagnetic fields. Here we review the recent advances in optical skyrmions within a unified topological framework. Starting from fundamental theories and classification of skyrmionic states, we describe generation and topological control of different kinds of skyrmions in evanescent, structured and spatiotemporal optical fields. We further highlight generalized classes of optical topological quasiparticles beyond skyrmions and outline the emerging applications, future trends and open challenges. A complex vectorial field structure of optical quasiparticles with versatile topological characteristics emerges as an important feature in modern spin optics, imaging, metrology, optical forces, structured light, and topological and quantum technologies. Advances in the understanding of optical skyrmions, within a unified topological framework, are reviewed. The field structure of such optical quasiparticles, and their topological characteristics, may be useful for fields ranging from imaging to quantum technologies.

ABSTRACT: Topological spin structures of light, including the Skyrmion, Meron, and bi-Meron, are intriguing optical phenomena that arise from spin-orbit coupling. They have promising potential applications in nano-metrology, data storage, super-resolved imaging and chiral detection. Aside from the electric part of optical spin, of equal importance is the magnetic part, particularly the H-type electromagnetic modes for which the spin topological properties of the field are dominated by the magnetic field. However, their observation and measurement remains absent and faces difficult challenges. Here, we design a unique type of anapole probe to measure specifically the photonic spin structures dominated by magnetic fields. The probe is composed of an Ag-core and Si-shell nanosphere, which manifests as a pure magnetic dipole with no electric response. The effectiveness of the method was validated by characterizing the magnetic field distributions of various focused vector beams. It was subsequently employed to measure the magnetic topological spin structures, including individual Skyrmions and Meron/Skyrmion lattices for the first time. The proposed method may be a powerful tool to characterize the magnetic properties of optical spin and valuable in advancing spin photonics.

ABSTRACT: Plasmonic cluster arrays have demonstrated rich physics in topological photonics, but they are seriously affected by the material loss and limited by the requirement of high-precision machining. Here, we propose a kind of ultra-thin metaparticle arrays which can mimic the coupled localized plasmonic resonances at lower frequency ranges and so that can overcome the loss and fabrication problems in real metal plasmonic systems. The metaparticle is a metallic disk with circuitous grooves that can support both spoof electric and magnetic localized resonances, and these resonances can be pushed to a subwavelength region through tuning the geometric parameters. In virtue of the highly field confinement of these localized resonances, it is thought to be an ideal experimental platform to be an analogy with various near-field interactions in topological materials. As a first proof-of-concept study to show this feasibility, the subwavelength topological edge states at the zigzag metaparticle chain boundaries are numerically and experimentally demonstrated at microwave ranges. Moreover, the subwavelength topological edge states in this zigzag chain can be excited simply by the plane wave incidence, and the edge modes at two ends can be selectively excited by controlling the polarization direction. Therefore, this kind of metaparticle array not only provides an ideal platform to experimentally study various near-filed interaction dominated topological systems but may also find massive potential applications.

ABSTRACT: Topological insulators as relatively new quantum materials with the topologically protected conducting Dirac surface state reveal fantastic electronic and photonic characteristics. The photonic behaviors of topological insulators are particularly significant for exploring their optical phenomena and functional devices. Here, we present the generation of Tamm plasmon polaritons (TPPs) in a topological insulator multilayer structure consisting of a Bi1.5Sb0.5Te1.8Se1.2 (BSTS) nanofilm and a one-dimensional photonic crystal (PC). The results illustrate that the TPP electric field can locally concentrate between the BSTS nanofilm and PC, contributing to the improved light-BSTS interaction with a 3-fold enhancement of light absorption. It is also found that the near-infrared TPP response can be dynamically tailored by adjusting the PC layer thickness, BSTS nanofilm thickness, and angle of incident light. The theoretical calculations are in excellent agreement with the numerical simulations. Additionally, the TPP field intensity and light-topological insulator interaction are capable of being further reinforced by introducing a dielectric spacer between the BSTS nanofilm and PC. Our results will enrich the optical characteristics and application potential of topological insulators. (C) 2019 Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Since the discovery of topological insulators, topological phases have generated considerable attention across the physics community. The superlattices in particular offer a rich system with several degrees of freedom to explore a variety of topological characteristics and control the localization of states. Albeit their importance, characterizing topological invariants in superlattices consisting of a multi-band structure is challenging beyond the basic case of two-bands as in the Su-Schreifer-Heeger model. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the direct measurement of the topological character of chiral superlattices with broken inversion symmetry. Using a CMOS-compatible nanophotonic chip, we probe the state evolving in the system along the propagation direction using novel nano -scattering structures. We employ a two-waveguide bulk excitation scheme to the superlattice, enabling the iden-tification of topological zero-energy modes through measuring the beam displacement. Our measurements reveal quantized beam displacement corresponding to 0.088 and -0.245, in the cases of trivial and nontrivial photonic superlattices, respectively, showing good agreement with the theoretical values of 0 and-0.25. Our results provide direct identification of the quantized topological numbers in superlattices using a single-shot approach, paving the way for direct measurements of topological invariants in complex photonic structures using tailored excitations with Wannier functions.

ABSTRACT: Compact unbalanced splitters are a key constitutive block to achieve flexibility in future multimode applications relying on silicon-on-insulator technology. Their design, however, poses significant challenges as it has to combine high performance for the different supported modes, a compact size, and compliance with fabrication constraints. In this letter, we employ topological derivative to optimize the design of bimodal unbalanced splitters with predefined split ratios of 2:1 and 3:1. Numerical simulations reveal that the optimized devices achieve the desired ratios with insertion losses of 0.6 dB and 0.5 dB, and crosstalks of -18.2 dB and -16.4 dB, both in a compact footprint of 4.2 mu m x 3.5 mu m.

ABSTRACT: "Transport, relocation, and self-assembly of nano and microparticles in colloidal systems are highly demanded in nanotechnology, photonics, microfluidics, and biotechnology  topological charges can provide an effective means for these purposes. We report that crumpled two-dimensional (2D) graphene oxide (GO) particle sheets in nematic fields can serve as a nest for complicated topological defect loops, which, in turn, provide mobility and inter-adhesiveness to the GO particles. The application of electric fields actuated the GO particles orthogonally, inducing their coalescence into large radial clusters upon absorption of other GO particles. In contrast, in the isotropic phase, where no topological defects existed, the GO particles electrostatically repelled each other owing to the presence of surface charges with equal sign. We also demonstrate that predesigned shallow surface trenches on a substrate can anchor seed GO particles, which attract other GO particles to create a macroscopic structure along the trench.

ABSTRACT: Topological states of matter are particularly robust, since they exploit global features of a material's band structure. Topological states have already been observed for electrons, atoms, and photons. It is an outstanding challenge to create a Chern insulator of sound waves in the solid state. In this work, we propose an implementation based on cavity optomechanics in a photonic crystal. The topological properties of the sound waves can be wholly tuned in situ by adjusting the amplitude and frequency of a driving laser that controls the optomechanical interaction between light and sound. The resulting chiral, topologically protected phonon transport can be probed completely optically. Moreover, we identify a regime of strong mixing between photon and phonon excitations, which gives rise to a large set of different topological phases and offers an example of a Chern insulator produced from the interaction between two physically distinct particle species, photons and phonons.

ABSTRACT: A Weyl semimetal (WSM) features Weyl fermions in its bulk and topological surface states on surfaces, and is novel material hosting Weyl fermions, a kind of fundamental particles. The WSM was regarded as a three-dimensional version of graphene under the illusion. In order to explore its promising photoelectric properties and applications in photonics and photoelectronics, here, we study the anisotropic linear and nonlinear optical responses of a WSM TaAs, which are determined by the relationship and balance between its topological surface states and Weyl nodes. We demonstrate that topological surface states which break the bulk symmetry are responsible for the anisotropy of the mobility, and the anisotropic nonlinear response shows saturable characteristic with extremely large saturable intensity. We also find that the mobility is anisotropic with the magnitude of 104 cm(2)V(-1)s(-1) at room temperature and can be accelerated by the optical field. By analyzing the symmetry, the nonlinear response is mainly contributed by the fermions close to the Weyl nodes, and is related to the Pauli's blocking of fermions, electron-electron interaction. This work experimentally discovers the anisotropic ultrahigh mobility of WSMs in the optical field and may start the field for the applications of WSMs in photonics and photoelectronics.

ABSTRACT: Enhancing light-matter interactions is necessary in a wide range of applications, such as sensing, nanophotonics, nonlinear and quantum optics. Nanoscale interactions are typically enhanced through localized resonances, resulting in a stringent trade-off between bandwidth, footprint, and overall enhancement factor. Here, we discuss how nonreciprocal electromagnetic hotspots, arising at the truncation of nonreciprocal and topological interfaces, can decouple these quantities, supporting extremely large and broadband field enhancements, leading to efficient nonlinear phenomena at the nanoscale and extreme broadband enhancement of local density of states. We discuss the impact of material nonlocality and surface roughness on these effects, providing closed-form expressions for the field enhancement in the presence of nonlocality and material loss, and demonstrating that many of these effects can be observed in several realistic scenarios. Finally, we outline how topological photonics can play a role in establishing these nonreciprocal hotspots. Our findings open opportunities to implement broadband nanophotonic platforms and metamaterials that exploit topological concepts to enable exotic light-matter interactions.

ABSTRACT: We have designed, investigated, and experimentally realized a topological surface state (TSS) localized at the interface of two stratified photonic media. The manifested state is protected by the spatial inversion symmetry of the constituents, which permits the assignment of quantized topological invariants to them. The genesis of the surface state can be traced to the characteristic difference in the bulk topological behavior of the underlying stopbands. Specifically, in the present realization of TSS, we have resorted to a concatenation of topologically inequivalent first and second-order stopbands of two planar photonic crystals and established the disparity in their stopband characteristics.

ABSTRACT: Second-order nonlinearities in whispering gallery mode resonators are highly investigated for their many applications such as wavelength converters, entangled photon sources, and generation of frequency combs. In such systems, depending on the material under scrutiny, the derivation of quasi-phase matching equations can lead to the appearance of additional quanta in the selection rule on the azimuthal confinement order. Here, we demonstrate that these additional quanta show up due to the Berry phase experienced by the transverse spin angular momentum components of the whispering gallery modes during their circulation within the resonator. We first detail the case of Zinc-blende materials and then generalize this theory to other crystal symmetries relevant for integrated photonics

ABSTRACT: In recent years the study of topological phases of matter has emerged as a very exciting field of research, both in photonics and in electronics. However, up to now the electronic and photonic properties have been regarded as totally independent. Here we establish a link between the electronic and the photonic topological phases of the same material system and theoretically demonstrate that they are intimately related. We propose a realization of the Haldane model as a patterned two-dimensional electron gas and determine its optical response using the Kubo formula. It is shown that the electronic and photonic phase diagrams of the patterned electron gas are strictly related. In particular, the system has a trivial photonic topology when the inversion symmetry is the prevalent broken symmetry, whereas it has a nontrivial photonic topology for a dominant broken time-reversal symmetry, similar to the electronic case. To confirm these predictions, we numerically demonstrate the emergence of topologically protected unidirectional electromagnetic edge states at the interface with a trivial photonic material.

ABSTRACT: We present here the use of Berry's topological phase for possible realization of fiber optic sensors and devices. Berry's phase is the phase change that can be effected on a light beam without changing the optical path length, but by changing the direction of propagation of light. This phase is not dependent on the material properties of the medium through which light is traveling and hence achromatic. A tunable reflectivity fibre loop mirror based on this phase is demonstrated.

ABSTRACT: Bi2O2S has gradually attracted the interest of researchers due to its excellent carrier mobility and light absorption property. However, its application in photoelectrochemical water splitting is very limited. In this work, hydrothermal treatment is performed on the obtained Bi2O2S film. Bi2S3 nanowires are in-situ evolved by the topological transformation of Bi2O2S, and heterojunction with atomic-level contact interface is constructed. The photocurrent density of Bi2O2S/Bi2S3 photoelectrode at 1.23 V vs. RHE is 3.82 mA/cm2, which is 14 times that of monomer Bi2O2S. The Bi2O2S/Bi2S3 heterojunction co-shared by Bi atoms has a close contact coupling interface, which stimulates stronger interfacial charge transfer. In addition, the 2D/1D morphology of the synthesized Bi2O2S nanosheets combined with Bi2S3 nanowires by fine tuning builds a channel for fast carrier transport. This study provides reference and inspiration for the preparation of highly active heterostructures, and expands new paths for the design and application of Bi2O2S based photoelectrodes.(c) 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

ABSTRACT: One of the most exciting breakthroughs in physics is the concept of topology that was recently introduced to photonics, achieving robust functionalities, as manifested in the recently demonstrated topological lasers. However, so far almost all attention was focused on lasing from topological edge states. Bulk bands that reflect the topological bulk-edge correspondence have been largely missed. Here, we demonstrate an electrically pumped topological bulk quantum cascade laser (QCL) operating in the terahertz (THz) frequency range. In addition to the band-inversion induced in-plane reflection due to topological nontrivial cavity surrounded by a trivial domain, we further illustrate the band edges of such topological bulk lasers are recognized as the bound states in the continuum (BICs) due to their nonradiative characteristics and robust topological polarization charges in the momentum space. Therefore, the lasing modes show both in-plane and out-of-plane tight confinements in a compact laser cavity (lateral size similar to 3 lambda(laser)). Experimentally, we realize a miniaturized THz QCL that shows single-mode lasing with a side-mode suppression ratio (SMSR) around 20 dB. We also observe a cylindrical vector beam for the far-field emission, which is evidence for topological bulk BIC lasers. Our demonstration on miniaturization of single-mode beam-engineered THz lasers is promising for many applications including imaging, sensing, and communications.

ABSTRACT: Resolving the complex interplay between surface and bulk response is a long-standing issue in the topological insulators (TIs). Some studies have reported surface-dominated metallic responses, yet others show semiconducting-like bulk photoconductance. Using ultrafast terahertz spectroscopy with the advent of Fermi-level engineered TIs, we discovered that such difference arises from the time-dependent competing process of two parameters, namely, the Dirac-carrier surface scattering rate and the bulk Drude weight. After infrared femtosecond pulse excitation, we observed a metal-like photoconductance reduction for the prototypical n-type Bi2Se3 and a semiconductor-like increased photoconductance for the p-type Bi2Se3. Surprisingly, the bulkinsulating Bi2Se3, which is presumably similar to graphene, exhibits a semiconducting-to-metallic phase apparent transition at 10 ps. The sign-reversed, yet long-lasting (>= 500 ps) metallic photoconductance was observed only in the bulk-insulating Bi2Se3, indicating that such dynamic phase transition is governed by the time-dependent competing interplay between the surface scattering rate and the bulk Drude weight. Our observations illustrate new photophysical phenomena of the photoexcited-phase transition in TIs and demonstrate entirely distinct dynamics compared to graphene and conventional gapped semiconductors.

ABSTRACT: Under strong laser radiation, a Dirac material, the topological insulator (TI) Bi2Te3, exhibits an optical transmittance increase as a result of saturable absorption. Based on an open-aperture Z-scan measurement at 1550 nm, we clearly show that the TI, Bi2Te3 under our investigation, is indeed a very-high-modulation-depth (up to 95%) saturable absorber. Furthermore, a TI based saturable absorber device was fabricated and used as a passive mode locker for ultrafast pulse formation at the telecommunication band. This contribution unambiguously shows that apart from its fantastic electronic property, a TI (Bi2Te3) may also possess attractive optoelectronic property for ultrafast photonics.

ABSTRACT: Plasmons can be supported on graphene sheets as the Dirac electrons oscillate collectively. A tight-binding model for graphene plasmons is a good description as the field confinement in the normal direction is strong. With this model, the topological properties of plasmonic bands in multilayer graphene systems are investigated. The Zak phases of periodic graphene sheet arrays are obtained for different configurations. Analogous to Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model in electronic systems, topological edge plasmon modes emerge when two periodic graphene sheet arrays with different Zak phases are connected. Interestingly, the dispersion of these topological edge modes is the same as that in the monolayer graphene and is invariant as the geometric parameters of the structure such as the separation and period change. These plasmonic edge states in multilayer graphene systems can be further tuned by electrical gating or chemical doping. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America

ABSTRACT: Topological protection in photonics offers new prospects for guiding and manipulating classical and quantum information. The mechanism of spin-orbit coupling promises the emergence of edge states that are helical, exhibiting unidirectional propagation that is topologically protected against back scattering. We directly observe the topological states of a photonic analog of electronic materials exhibiting the quantum spin Hall effect, living at the interface between two silicon photonic crystals with different topological order. Through the far-field radiation that is inherent to the states' existence, we characterize their properties, including linear dispersion and low loss. We find that the edge state pseudospin is encoded in unique circular far-field polarization and linked to unidirectional propagation, thus revealing a signature of the underlying photonic spin-orbit coupling. We use this connection to selectively excite different edge states with polarized light and directly visualize their routing along sharp chiral waveguide junctions.

ABSTRACT: Active topological phase transitions widely occur in active matters and biological systems, such as developing embryos. Since the discovery of the intriguing bulk-boundary effects of topological insulators in Hermitian and non-Hermitian systems, various electric, optical, acoustic, and mechanical topological metamaterials with efficient energy transmission and robust defect-immunization have been designed. To date, however, it remains a challenge to precisely and fast manipulate the topological phase transitions in elastic topological insulators. In this paper, on the basis of theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we propose an active strategy to achieve this aim through a combination of pneumatic actuation and liquid metals. The proposed method can precisely tune the connecting stiffness and vertex mass in the tight Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. Thus, we realize the effective and fast control of topological phase transitions and elastic wave bandgap switching. We also uncover the active spinning bulk-boundary effects and higher-order topological states in the elastic topological insulators, demonstrating the high effectiveness and practicability of the proposed method. In addition, the differences between the 1D edge and 0D corner higher-order states are specified by information entropy theory. This work not only gains insights into the active manipulation of topological phase transitions but also inspires novel strategies to design active topological materials through untethered methods, e.g., magnetism or biological cells.

ABSTRACT: As newly emerging nanomaterials, topological insulators with unique conducting surface states that are protected by time-reversal symmetry present excellent prospects in electronics and photonics. The active control of light absorption in topological insulators are essential for the achievement of novel optoelectronic devices. Herein, we investigate the controllable light absorption of topological insulators in Tamm plasmon multilayer systems composed of a Bi1.5Sb0.5Te1.8Se1.2 (BSTS) film and a dielectric Bragg mirror with a graphene-involved defect layer. The results show that an ultranarrow electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT)-like window can be generated in the broad absorption spectrum. Based on the EIT-like effect, the Tamm plasmon enhanced light absorption of topological insulators can be dynamically tuned by adjusting the gate voltage on graphene in the defect layer. These results will pave a new avenue for the realization of topological insulator-based active optoelectronic functionalities, for instance light modulation and switching.

ABSTRACT: Photonic topological insulators protected by the lattice spatial symmetry (e.g., inversion and rotation symmetry) mainly support single type edge state, interpreted by either valley or pseudo-spin. Here, we demonstrate theoretically, numerically, and experimentally that a type of judiciously designed two-dimensional Kekule photonic crystal with time reversal symmetry can possess topological valley and pseudo-spin edge states in different frequency bands. Topologically robust transportation of both the valley and pseudo-spin edge states was confirmed by measuring the transmission of straight and z-shaped interface supported edge mode and comparing with bulk modes in the microwave frequency regime. In addition, we show that due to the distinct topological origins, valley and pseudo-spin edge states can be distinguished by examining their end-scattering into the free space. Our system provides an alternative way in manipulating electromagnetic waves with additional degree-of-freedom, which has potential applications for robust and high-capacity waveguiding and multi-mode dividing.

ABSTRACT: "In nanophotonics, small mode volumes, high-quality factor resonances, and large field enhancements without metals fundamentally scale with the refractive index and are key for many implementations involving light-matter interactions. Topological insulators (TIs) are a class of insulating materials that host topologically protected surface states, some of which exhibit extraordinarily high permittivity values. Here, the optical properties of TI bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3) single crystals are studied. It is found that both the bulk and surface states contribute to the extremely large optical constants, with the real part of the refractive index peaking at n & AP  11. Utilizing these ultra-high index values, it is demonstrated that Bi2Te3 metasurfaces are capable of squeezing light in deep-subwavelength structures, with the fundamental magnetic dipole (MD) resonance confined in unit cell sizes smaller than & lambda /10. It is further shown that dense ultrathin metasurface arrays can simultaneously provide large magnetic and electric field enhancements arising from the high index of the bulk and the surface metallic states. These findings demonstrate the potential of chalcogenide TIs as a platform leveraging the unique combination of ultra-high-index dielectric response with surface metallic states for metamaterial design and nanophotonic applications in sensing, non-linear generation, and quantum information."

ABSTRACT: Type II superlattices (T2SLs) based on alternating layers of InAs and GaSb exhibit rather unique properties, including a zero band gap at a critical value of the layer thicknesses. In this respect, T2SLs bear a close relationship to the alloy, Hg1-xCdxTe (MCT), where the band gap vanishes at a critical value of the composition parameter, x. A 15 mu m pitch T2SL Long Wave Infrared array detector has recently been developed by SCD, based on a new XBp barrier architecture and a new and robust passivation process. This detector is made entirely from III-V materials and exhibits performance comparable to high quality MCT detectors. The SCD T2SL XBp detector contains both an InAs/GaSb active layer (AL) and an InAs/AlSb barrier layer. A k . p simulation method is described which can predict both the quantum efficiency and dark current with reasonable precision, from a basic definition of the superlattice period and the AL stack thickness. Results are compared with simulations for type I HgTe/CdTe superlattices. The method introduces a number of novel features including the use of an interface matrix, and a way of calculating the Luttinger parameters from standard reference values. For layer thicknesses greater than the critical values, both InAs/GaSb/AlSb and HgTe/CdTe superlattices undergo a transition to a Topological Insulator (TI) phase. The TI phase exhibits unusual spin polarized transport and optical properties which may be useful in future spintronic and THz devices.

ABSTRACT: The increase of the software complexity makes how to understand software systems a hard work. Since you cannot control what you cannot measure, many research works have been done on software metrics. But one key property has always been neglect, i.e., the topological properties of software systems. In this paper, we proposed to analyze object-oriented (OO) software systems from the perspective of software topological property. First, OO software systems are represented by network at method and class level, respectively. Then we introduce complex network theory to analyze the topological properties of these networks. A case study on an open source OO software system, JHotDraw 5.1, gives an illustration of our approach. Our approach can give further understanding of OO software systems.

ABSTRACT: We demonstrate experimentally that a photonic crystal made of Al2O3 cylinders exhibits topological time--reversal symmetric electromagnetic propagation, similar to the quantum spin Hall effect in electronic systems. A pseudospin degree of freedom in the electromagnetic system representing different states of orbital angular momentum arises due to a deformation of the photonic crystal from the ideal honeycomb lattice. It serves as the photonic analogue to the electronic Kramers pair. We visualized qualitatively and measured quantitatively that microwaves of a specific pseudospin propagate only in one direction along the interface between a topological photonic crystal and a trivial one. As only a conventional dielectric material is used and only local real--space manipulations are required, our scheme can be extended to visible light to inspire many future applications in the field of photonics and beyond.

ABSTRACT: In the development of topological photonics, achieving three-dimensional topological insulators is of notable interest since it enables the exploration of new topological physics with photons and promises novel photonic devices that are robust against disorders in three dimensions. Previous theoretical proposals toward three-dimensional topological insulators use complex geometries that are challenging to implement. On the basis of the concept of synthetic dimension, we show that a two-dimensional array of ring resonators, which was previously demonstrated to exhibit a two-dimensional topological insulator phase, automatically becomes a three-dimensional topological insulator when the frequency dimension is taken into account. Moreover, by modulating a few of the resonators, a screw dislocation along the frequency axis can be created, which provides robust one-way transport of photons along the frequency axis. Demonstrating the physics of screw dislocation in a topological system has been a substantial challenge in solid-state systems. Our work indicates that the physics of three-dimensional topological insulators can be explored in standard integrated photonic platforms, leading to opportunities for novel devices that control the frequency of light.

ABSTRACT: We reveal that topological insulators (TI) HgTe/CdTe quantum well have a strong nonlinear optical property in the three-photon mixing. While the gapless surface state in TI can exhibit strong nonlinear effect due to the linear energy dispersion, the nonparabolic energy dispersion of the bulk state is responsible for the photo mixing effect reported here. To produce response at terahertz frequency regime from femtosecond electrical fields, the mixing efficiency is around 10(-4) comparable to that of nonlinear semiconductor crystals. The optimal temperature for this nonlinear effect is around 100K. The results suggest a potential application of TI in terahertz photonics. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

ABSTRACT: Topologically protected photonic edge states allow backscattering-free and disorder-immune light propagations, offering a new scheme for the development of on-chip information systems. Valley degree of freedom is one of the most reliable way to achieve topologically non-trivial states. Here, we take advantage of heterogeneous topological interfaces to construct integrated optical devices in the valley-dependent photonic crystals. Localized Berry curvature around the K/K ' point guarantees the existence of valley kink states at telecom wavelengths below the light cone, ensuring both optical robustness and light confinement. We harness the combination of two kinds of bearded interfaces to realize wavelength-selective topological routing of light in the micro-ring resonators. The proposed bearded interfaces can support edge modes with large group indices up to 90, showing a great potential to obtain remarkable slow light effects. This work paves the way to implement optical buffers and reconfigurable photonic devices with the adoption of photonic valley pseudospin.

ABSTRACT: We experimentally observe lasing in a hexamer plasmonic lattice and find that, when tuning the scale of the unit cell, the polarization properties of the emission change. By a theoretical analysis, we identify the lasing modes as quasi-bound-states in continuum of topological charges of zero, one, or two. A T-matrix simulation of the structure reveals that the mode quality (Q) factors depend on the scale of the unit cell, with highest-Q modes favored by lasing. The system thus shows a loss-driven transition between lasing in modes of trivial and high-order topological charge.

ABSTRACT: Compared with the on-axis vortex beam and the off-axis single vortex beam, the off-axis double vortex beam has more control degrees of freedom and brings rich physical properties. In this work, we investigate theoretically and experimentally the generation, topological charge (TC), and orbital angular momentum (OAM) of off-axis double vortex beams. It is demonstrated that the tilted lens method can detect not only the magnitudes and signs of two TCs of the off-axis double vortex beam but also the spatial distribution of the TCs. Moreover, the average OAM value of the off-axis double vortex beam decreases nonlinearly as the off-axis distance increases, although its TC is independent of the off-axis distance of phase singularities. The results indicate that the average OAM of the off-axis double vortex beam can be easily controlled by changing the relative position of two-phase singularities, thereby realizing the applications of multi-degrees of freedom particle manipulation, optical communication, and material processing.

ABSTRACT: Passive Q-switching of praseodymium (Pr3+)-doped fiber lasers at 635 nm with topological insulators (TIs) saturable absorbers (SAs) was experimentally demonstrated for the first time. TIs (Bi2Se3, Bi2Te3) nanosheets were embedded in polyvinyl alcohol for film-forming and incorporated into a visible Pr3+-doped fiber laser cavity for Q-switching operation, respectively. The Bi2Se3-based Q-switched fiber laser has a wide range pulse-repetition-rate from 191.6 to 454.5 kHz, and the Bi2Te3 one can be continuously tuned from 164.5 to 403.2 kHz. Both the Q-switching lasers have narrow pulse duration of nanosecond (ns)-level. Our results reveal that the TIs-based SAs are available for pulsed operation in the visible spectral range.

ABSTRACT: Topological states in photonics were initially proposed by Haldane in analogy to the quantum Hall (QH) effect in electronic system. Topological acoustics has also been demonstrated recently. In this paper, an integral formulation is developed to study the band structure and the band modal field distribution within a phononic crystal that supports acoustic topological edge states through rotations of the ambient fluid. The governing acoustic wave equation includes a vector potential term that originates from the rotation and lifts the degeneracy at the Dirac points and induces topological wave phenomena. This wave equation resembles that governs the wave function of a nonrelativistic particle in a periodic vector potential and can be mapped to a QH system. We have converted this modified inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation into a volume/surface integral equation using the periodic lattice Green's function of the stationary ambient fluid. We represent the lattice Green's function using a novel hybrid representation that includes fast converging spatial series evaluated at a given imaginary wavenumber and a fast converging spectral series in terms of Floquet plane waves that is suitable for broadband evaluations. The volume integral equation is solved using the method of moments and converted into a nonlinear eigenvalue problem. We illustrate solutions of this eigenvalue problem that represent band diagrams and band modal field distributions of the phononic crystal that vary with the magnitude and direction of the ambient fluid rotation. Topologically protected eigenmodes are revealed at K point in the Brillouin zone.

ABSTRACT: Output power and beam quality are the two main bottlenecks for semiconductor lasers-the favourite light sources in countless applications because of their compactness, high efficiency and cheapness. Both limitations are due to the fact that it becomes increasingly harder to stabilize a single-mode laser over a broader chip area without multi-mode operations. Here we address this fundamental difficulty with the Dirac-vortex topological cavity(1), which offers the optimal single-mode selection in two dimensions. Our topological-cavity surface-emitting laser (TCSEL) exhibits 10 W peak power, sub-1 degrees divergence angle and 60 dB side-mode suppression, among the best-reported performance ever at 1,550 nm-the most important telecommunication and eye-safe wavelength where high-performance surface emitters have always been difficult to make(2). We also demonstrate the multi-wavelength capability of two-dimensional TCSEL arrays that are not generally available for commercial lasers(2,3). TCSEL, as a new-generation high-brightness surface emitter, can be directly extended to any other wavelength range and is promising for an extremely wide variety of uses.

ABSTRACT: A single-wall carbon nanotube can be viewed as a one-dimensional material created by rolling up a sheet of graphene. Its electronic band structure depends on the chirality, i.e., how the sheet has been rolled up, yet synthesizing the symmetry at will is rather challenging. We structure an artificial honeycomb lattice in both a zigzag and an armchair tube and explore their topological features for sound. Our findings reveal how armchair tubes remain gapless, whereas the zigzag counterparts host nontrivial edge states of non-zero quantized Zak phase, which are dictated by the circumferential number of units. Unlike man-made planar lattices whose underling symmetry must be broken to harvest quantum Hall and pseudospin phases, interestingly, the structured tubular lattice symmetry remains intact, while its nontrivial phase alone is governed by the chirality and the tube diameter. We foresee that our results, not only for sound, but also in photonics, mechanics and electronics will broaden future avenues for fundamental and applied sciences. Single-wall carbon nanotubes are made of carbon with diameters less than 100 nanometers. Here, the authors engineer an analogue tube with a diameter 1,000,000 times larger with the aim to explore topological properties including unusual acoustic edge states.

ABSTRACT: As new states of matter currently attracting broad attention in the optics field, topological insulators (TIs) present topologically-protected conducting surface states surrounding insulating bulk and prominent third-order optical nonlinearities in an ultrawide frequency range. Optical frequency conversion in TI nanofilms plays a crucial role in TI nonlinear optical functionalities, whose enhancement is in demand for high-performance devices. Herein, an optical Tamm state is observed between the Sb2Te3 TI nanofilm and 1D photonic crystal (PC) as well as a self-enhancement behavior of optical nonlinearity in the TI nanofilm. The experiments demonstrate that there exists a distinct reflection dip in the forbidden band of the PC, which is attributed to the appearance of Tamm state in the TI/PC structure. The wavelength of the TI-based Tamm state possesses a nearly linear redshift with increasing TI film thickness. The measurements are in excellent agreement with simulation and theoretical calculations. Moreover, a strong third-harmonic generation reinforcement of 30-fold is experimentally observed in a 90 nm Sb2Te3 film, which stems from the field enhancement induced by the TI self-excited Tamm state at the fundamental frequency. This work opens a new door for generation of optical Tamm states and applications of TIs in high-efficiency nonlinear optical functionalities, especially frequency conversion.

ABSTRACT: The topological phase transitions (TPT) of light refers to a topological evolution from one type of spin-orbit interaction to another, which has been recently found in beam scattering at optical interfaces and propagation in uniaxial crystals. In this work, the focusing of off-axis and partially masked circular-polarization Gaussian beams are investigated by using of a full-wave theory. Moreover, two different types of spin-orbit interactions (i.e., spin-dependent vortex generation and photonic spin-Hall effect) in the focusing system are unified from the perspective of TPT. It is demonstrated that as the off-axis distance or the masked area increases, a TPT phenomenon in the focused optical field takes place, evolving from the spin-dependent vortex generation to the spin-Hall shift of the beam centroids. The intrinsic mechanism is attributed to the cylindrical symmetry-breaking of the system. This symmetry-breaking induced TPT based on the method of vortex mode decomposition is further examined. The main difference between the TPT phenomenon observed here and that trigged by oblique incidence at optical interfaces or oblique propagation in uniaxial crystals is also uncovered. Our findings provide fruitful insights for understanding the spin-orbit interactions in optics, providing an opportunity for unifying the TPT phenomena in various spin-orbit photonics systems.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonic edge states are conventionally formed at the interface between two domains of topologically trivial and nontrivial photonic crystals. Recent works exploiting photonic quantum Hall and quantum-valley-Hall effects have shown that large-area topological waveguide states could be created in a three-layer topological heterostructure that consists of a finite-width domain featuring a Dirac cone sandwiched between two domains of photonic crystals with opposite topological properties. In this Letter, we show that an alternative kind of large-area topological waveguide state could be created employing the photonic analogs of the quantum-spin-Hall effect. Taking the well-used Wu-Hu model in topological photonics as an example, we show that sandwiching a finite-width domain of photonic crystals featuring a double Dirac cone between two domains of expanded and shrunken unit cells could lead to the emergence of large-area topological helical waveguide states distributed uniformly in the middle domain. Importantly, we unveil a power-law scaling related to the size of the band gap within which the large-area helical states reside as a function of the width of the middle domain, which implies that these large-area modes in principle could exist in the middle domain with arbitrary width. Moreover, pseudospin-momentum-locking unidirectional propagations and the robustness of these large-area waveguide modes against sharp bends are explicitly demonstrated. Our work broadens the photonic systems and platforms that could be utilized for large-area-mode-enabled topological waveguiding.

ABSTRACT: There is an ever-growing need to study the optical response of complex photonic systems involving multiscattering phenomena with strong near-field interactions. Since fully numerical methods often imply high computational costs, semi-analytical methods are preferred. However, most semi-analytical methods are commonly plagued by what is known as the problem of the Rayleigh Hypothesis: they typically use analytical representations of the scattered fields that are invalid in the near-field region of the scatterer. In this work, we present an alternative representation scheme for the scattered fields based on a distribution of multipolar sources across the topological skeleton of the scatterer. We demonstrate how such a representation overcomes the problem of the Rayleigh Hypothesis for scatterers of arbitrary geometry. In that regard, our work enriches the available toolkit of semi-analytical methods in light-scattering by pushing decisively against one of the fundamental limitations of the existing methods.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Photonic higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs) based on kagome photonic crystals (PCs) possess rich physics of corner states for the unignorable long-range interactions. Theoretically, there should be multiple corner states, i.e., type I, antisymmetric type II, and symmetric type II corner states, in the kagome PCs. However, for the generation of some corner states, especially the symmetric type II corner states, it is necessary to obtain a large ratio of intercell coupling to intracell coupling, which makes the spacing between dielectric units very small and difficult to achieve experimentally. Here, we propose a scheme for the deterministic generation of multiple topological corner states based on an extremely expanded coupling condition. We construct an equilateral triangular cavity that consists of nontrivial unit cells in triangular PCs. All three topological corner states can exist robustly in the triangular cavity with large dielectric unit spacing. By establishing a tight-binding model for the nontrivial unit cell, we reveal that the extremely expanded coupling condition is the core physical mechanism for the deterministic generation of multiple corner states. The study provides a simple and deterministic method to generate multiple topological corner states, which has great potential in topological robust cavity, optical switches and lasers in integrated photonics on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) or III-V active semiconductor platform.

ABSTRACT: The discovery of graphene has intrigued the significant interest in exploring and developing the two-dimensional layered materials (2DI,Ms) for the photonics application in recent years. Unlike the isotropic graphene, a number of 2DLMs possess the in-plane anisotropic crystal structure with low symmetry, enabling a new degree of freedom for achieving the novel polarization-dependent and versatile ultrafast photonic devices. In this review article, we focus on the typical anisotropic 2DLMs including BP, ReS2, ReSe2, SnS, and SnSe and summarize the recent development of these anisotropic 2DLMs in the pulsed laser and the optical switch applications. First, we introduce the fabrication methods as well as the material characterization of the anisotropic 2DLMs by analyzing the polarized Raman configuration. Second, we discuss the anisotropic nonlinear optical properties of the anisotropic 2DLMs and concentrate on the anisotropic nonlinear absorption response. Next, we sum up state of the art of the anisotropic 2DLMs in the application of pulse lasers and optical switches. This review ends with perspectives on the challenge and outlook of the anisotropic 2DLMs for ultrafast photonics applications.

ABSTRACT: The successful demonstration of Q-switched and mode-locked fiber-laser operations using a topological insulator (TI) as saturable absorber (SA) has opened an application window besides TI's originally expected features. However, to date, all-solid-state mode-locked lasers base on TISAs are still unavailable and became a desired goal not only due to their application as light sources, but also because of providing a way for deeper investigation of the nature of ultrafast dynamics present in TISAs. In this paper, the realization of a continuous-wave mode-locked all-solid-state laser with a repetition rate of around 1 GHz is reported using a high-quality TI SA mirror (TI-SAM) with ultralow saturation intensity, fabricated by a spin coating-co-reduction approach. An output power of 180 mW and pulse duration of 8 ps are observed. In addition, a 61 dB pulse-train quality from the radio frequency spectrum of mode-locked operation prove the feasibility of the proposed laser. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first experimental demonstration of a mode-locked solid-state laser based on TIs. In addition, this paper shows that the use of TISAs is a promising option for the realization of scaling solid-state mode-locked lasers with higher repetition rates, reaching order of GHz.

ABSTRACT: Two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), topological insulators and black phosphorus, have been widely used in the generation of ultrafast pulsed lasers due to their strong photo-material interactions and excellent saturable absorption characteristics. In this work, we investigated the optical characteristics of few-layer Ti2CTx (T=O, OH or F) nanosheets and employed them as saturated absorbers to obtain ultrafast fiber lasers. A stable femtosecond-pulse Er-doped fiber laser with 265 fs at a central wavelength of 1.5 mu m and a highly stable picosecond-pulse Yb-doped fiber laser with a high signal-to-noise ratio of up to 75 dB at a central wavelength of 1037.8 nm, we separately obtained by using a few-layer Ti2CTx nanosheet saturable absorber (Ti2CTx-SA). The study results show that Ti2CTx nanosheets have excellent saturable absorption properties, and their absorption properties are comparable to those of other two-dimensional metal carbides and of other nitrides (MXene). It can be used as a broadband nonlinear optical material for broad application prospects in ultrafast photonics.

ABSTRACT: Ultrasmall black phosphorus quantum dots (BPQDs) with an average size of 2.1 +/- 0.9 nm are synthesized by using a solvothermal method in a N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone solution. Verified by femto-second laser Z-scan measurement, BPQDs exhibit excellent nonlinear optical response with a modulation depth of about 36% and a saturable intensity of about 3.3 GW cm(-2). By using BPQDs as optical saturable absorber, the ultrashort pulse with a pulse duration of about 1.08 ps centered at a wavelength of 1567.5 nm is generated in mode-locked fiber laser. These results suggest that BPQDs may be developed as another kind of promising nanomaterial for ultrafast photonics.

ABSTRACT: A hallmark feature of topological physics is the presence of one-way propagating chiral modes at the system boundary(1,2). The chirality of edge modes is a consequence of the topological character of the bulk. For example, in a non-interacting quantum Hall model, edge modes manifest as mid-gap states between two topologically distinct bulk bands. The bulkboundary correspondence dictates that the number of chiral edge modes, a topological invariant called the winding number, is completely determined by the bulk topological invariant, the Chern number(3). Here, for the first time, we measure the winding number in a 2D photonic system. By inserting a unit flux quantum at the edge, we show that the edge spectrum resonances shift by the winding number. This experiment provides a new approach for unambiguous measurement of topological invariants, independent of the microscopic details, and could possibly be extended to probe strongly correlated topological orders.

ABSTRACT: Defect modes in two-dimensional periodic photonic structures have found use in diverse optical devices. For example, photonic crystal cavities confine optical modes to subwavelength volumes and can be used for enhancement of nonlinearity, lasing and cavity quantum electrodynamics. Defect-core photonic crystal fibres allow for supercontinuum generation and endlessly single-mode fibres with large cores. However, these modes are notoriously fragile: small structural change leads to significant detuning of resonance frequency and mode volume. Here, we show that photonic topological crystalline insulator structures can be used to topologically protect the mode frequency at mid-gap and minimize the volume of a photonic defect mode. We experimentally demonstrate this in a femtosecond-laser-written waveguide array by observing the presence of a topological zero mode confined to the corner of the array. The robustness of this mode is guaranteed by a topological invariant that protects zero-dimensional states embedded in a two-dimensional environment-a novel form of topological protection that has not been previously demonstrated.

ABSTRACT: Three-dimensional (3D) gapless topological phases can be classified by the dimensionality of the band degeneracies, including zero-dimensional (OD) nodal points, one-dimensional (1D) nodal lines, and two-dimensional (2D) nodal surfaces. Both nodal points and nodal lines have been realized recently in photonics and acoustics. However, a nodal surface has never been observed in any classical-wave system. Here, we report on the experimental observation of a twofold symmetry-enforced nodal surface in a 3D chiral acoustic crystal. In particular, the demonstrated nodal surface carries a topological charge of 2, constituting the first realization of a higher-dimensional topologically-charged band degeneracy. Using direct acoustic field measurements, we observe the projected nodal surface and its Fermi-arc-like surface states and demonstrate topologically-induced robustness of the surface states against disorders. This discovery of a higher-dimensional topologically-charged band degeneracy paves the way toward further explorations of the physics and applications of new topological semimetal phases.

ABSTRACT: The prediction and realization of topological insulators have sparked great interest in experimental approaches to the classification of materials(1-3). The phase transition between non-trivial and trivial topological states is important, not only for basic materials science but also for next-generation technology, such as dissipation-free electronics(4). It is therefore crucial to develop advanced probes that are suitable for a wide range of samples and environments. Here we demonstrate that circularly polarized laser-field-driven high-harmonic generation is distinctly sensitive to the non-trivial and trivial topological phases in the prototypical three-dimensional topological insulator bismuth selenide(5). The phase transition is chemically initiated by reducing the spin-orbit interaction strength through the substitution of bismuth with indium atoms(6,7). We find strikingly different high-harmonic responses of trivial and non-trivial topological surface states that manifest themselves as a conversion efficiency and elliptical dichroism that depend both on the driving laser ellipticity and the crystal orientation. The origins of the anomalous high-harmonic response are corroborated by calculations using the semiconductor optical Bloch equations with pairs of surface and bulk bands. As a purely optical approach, this method offers sensitivity to the electronic structure of the material, including its nonlinear response, and is compatible with a wide range of samples and sample environments.

ABSTRACT: Manipulation of momentum space in photonic structures has enabled a range of physical phenomena including negative refraction, slow light, enhanced nonlinearity and three-dimensional complete bandgaps. Recently, Topology, a property related to the global structure of the frequency dispersion of a photonic system, emerged as a new tool for the control of momentum space and an additional degree of freedom for the discovery of fundamentally new states of light. The Weyl point systems considered in this work are an excellent platform to investigate topological bosonic states. Weyl points act as monopoles or anti-monopoles Berry flux in momentum space, and carry chirality defined by quantised topological charges. In this work, the experimental realisation of photonic type I Weyl points at optical frequencies is demonstrated in a bio-inspired three-dimensional photonic crystal coated uniquely with layered-composite nanometric materials. More importantly, the chiral nature of the photonic Weyl points is discovered by coupling with spin-angular momentum carried by circularly polarised light. This Weyl-point induced mechanism leads to reversed circular dichroism along the directions that intersect the oppositely charged topological photonic states. This discovery provides an entirely new platform for developing topologically protected super-robust photonic devices in angular-momentum-based information processing, circular-dichroism-enabled protein sensing, spintronics and quantum optoelectronics.

ABSTRACT: Topological insulators represent a new quantum phase of matter with spin-polarized surface states that are protected from backscattering, exhibiting electronic responses to light, such as topological quantum phase transitions. However, the effects of high-frequency driving topological intrinsic systems have remained largely unexplored challenges experimentally for high-sensitivity terahertz detection. In this study, by integrating Sb2Te3 topological insulators with subwavelength metal antennas through micro-nano processing, a high-frequency terahertz detector with high sensitivity is proposed. The enhanced response originates from the asymmetric scattering of the surface electrons in the Sb2Te3 flakes induced by the terahertz wave. The device displays room-temperature photodetection with a responsivity of 192 mA/W and equivalent noise power of less than 0.35 nW/Hz(1/2) in the frequency range from 0.02 to 0.3 THz. These results pave the way for the exploitation of topological insulators for high-frequency operation in real-time imaging within long-wavelength optoelectronics. (c) 2022 Chinese Laser Press

ABSTRACT: Light propagates in various ways depending on environment, including uniform medium, surface/interface and photonic crystals, which appears ubiquitously in daily life and has been exploited for advanced optics technology. We unveiled that a topological photonic crystal exhibits unique electromagnetic (EM) transport properties originating from the Dirac frequency dispersion and multicomponent spinor eigenmodes. Measuring precisely local Poynting vectors in microstrips of honeycomb structure where optics topology emerges upon a band gap opening in the Dirac dispersion and a p-d band inversion induced by a Kekule-type distortion respecting C-6v symmetry, we showed that a chiral wavelet induces a global EM transportation circulating in the direction counter to the source, which is intimately related to the topological band gap specified by a negative Dirac mass. This brand-new Huygens-Fresnel phenomenon can be considered as the counterpart of negative refraction of EM plane waves associated with upwardly convex dispersions of photonic crystals, and our present finding is expected to open a new window for photonic innovations. Huygens-Fresnel features are useful for harnessing light in unique ways. Here the authors demonstrate a chiral light source that induces globally a counter energy flow in a topological photonics structure with Dirac-type frequency dispersion.

ABSTRACT: Discrete algorithms for symbolic computation of topological phases and observables in optical interferometric systems are presented and illustrated using a set of test models. The calculation of the parameters of a birefringent plate that can be measured by means of Mach-Zehnder interferometer is implemented in terms of Maple and Mathematica. Near-field test models of the systems, that possess both geometrical and dynamical phases in the far-field region, are constructed beyond the the bounds of the ray approximation. These models imply a set of discrete sources with variable parameters and make use of the appropriate set of separable potentials.

ABSTRACT: We recently proposed a two-dimensional synthetic space including one spatial axis and one synthetic frequency dimension in a one-dimensional ring resonator array [Opt. Lett., Vol. 41, No. 4, 741-744, 2016]. Nevertheless, the group velocity dispersion (GVD) of the waveguides that compose rings was ignored for simplicity. In this paper, we extend the previous work and study the topological one-way edge states in such a synthetic space involving GVD. We show that the GVD brings a natural vague boundary in the frequency dimension, so the topological edge state still propagates at several frequency modes unidirectionally along the spatial axis. Positions of such vague boundary can be controlled by changing the magnitude of the GVD. In particular, a relatively strong GVD can degrade this two-dimensional synthetic space to one-dimensional spatial lattice, but yet the one-way state is still preserved in simulations. Our work therefore exhibits the impact of the GVD on topological photonics in the synthetic space, which will be important for future practical experimental implementations.

ABSTRACT: The recent realizations of a topological valley phase in a photonic crystal, an analog of gapped valleytronic materials in an electronic system, are limited to the valley Chem number of one. In this paper, we present a type of valley phase that can have a large valley Chern number of two or three. The valley phase transitions between the different valley Chern numbers (from one to three) are realized by changing the configuration of the unit cell. We demonstrate that these topological phases can guide the wave propagation robustly along a sharply bent domain wall. We believe our results are promising for the exploration of new topological phenomena in photonic systems. (C) 2020 Chinese Laser Press

ABSTRACT: Terahertz (THz) topological photonic structures are promising for last-centimeter commune on in intra/interchip communication systems because they support bit-error-free THz signal transmission with topological robustness. Active and dynamically tunable THz topological photonic components have not yet been experimentally realized. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a THz topological switch (270-290 GHz) based on a valley Hall photonic crystal structured high-resistivity silicon substrate, in which the THz waves can be dynamically turned on/off by an external 447 nm continuous-wave laser. Our device exhibited an on/off ratio of 19 dB under a pumping light intensity of 240 mW mm(2). The 3 dB switching bandwidth was similar to 60 kHz. (C) 2022 Chinese Laser Press

ABSTRACT: Topological insulator lasers are a newly introduced kind of lasers in which light snakes around a cavity without scattering. Like for an electron current in a topological insulator material, a topologically protected lasing mode travels along the cavity edge, steering neatly around corners and imperfections without scattering or leaking out. In a recent experiment, topological insulator lasers have been demonstrated using a square lattice of coupled semiconductor microring resonators with a synthetic magnetic field. However, laser arrays with slow population dynamics are likely to show dynamical instabilities in a wide range of parameter space corresponding to realistic experimental conditions, thus preventing stable laser operation. While topological insulator lasers provide an interesting mean for combating disorder and help collective oscillation of lasers at the edge of the lattice, it is not clear whether chiral edge states are immune to dynamical instabilities. In this work we consider a realistic model of semiconductor class-B topological insulator laser and show that chiral edge states are not immune to dynamical instabilities. Copyright (C) EPLA, 2018

ABSTRACT: In this paper we study topological phases in a two-dimensional photonic crystal with broken time (T) and parity (P) symmetries by performing calculations of band structures, Berry curvatures, Chern numbers, edge states, and also numerical simulations of light propagation in the edge modes. Specifically, we consider a hexagonal lattice consisting of triangular gyromagnetic rods. Here the gyromagnetic material breaks T symmetry while the triangular rods break P symmetry. Interestingly, we find that the crystal could host quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) phases with different gap Chern numbers (C-g) including vertical bar C-g vertical bar > 1 as well as quantum valley Hall (QVH) phases with contrasting valley Chern numbers (C-v), depending on the orientation of the triangular rods. Furthermore, phase transitions among these topological phases, such as from QAH to QVH and vice versa, can be engineered by a simple rotation of the rods. Our band theoretical analyses reveal that the Dirac nodes at the K and K' valleys in the momentum space are produced and protected by the mirror symmetry (m(y)) instead of the P symmetry, and they become gapped when either T or m(y) symmetry is broken, resulting in a QAH or QVH phase, respectively. Moreover, a high Chern number (C-g = -2) QAH phase is generated by gapping triply degenerate nodal points rather than pairs of Dirac points by breaking T symmetry. Our proposed photonic crystal thus provides a platform for investigating intriguing topological phenomena which may be challenging to realize in electronic systems, and also has promising potentials for device applications in photonics such as reflection-free one-way waveguides and topological photonic circuits.

ABSTRACT: At present, functionalities, miniaturization, and tunability are useful directions in the development of practical device applications for topological photonics and phononics. Atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) materials not only have excellent mechanical properties, but also have outstanding electrical, optical, and magnetic properties, making them great candidates for tunable microdevices via electrostatic forces, magnetoacoustic, or photoacoustic coupling, etc. In this paper, we propose an elastic topological insulator based on atomically thin 2D materials pinned on honeycomb-patterned substrates. Thanks to acoustic impedance mismatch between the suspended 2D materials and the rigid substrates, both topological edge states and corner states of elastic waves inside the 2D materials can be achieved, accompanied by a display of functional components, e.g., arbitrary waveguides, splitters, resonators. Significantly, all these components for elastic waves are frequency tunable, due to the electromechanical sensitivity of the 2D material. For example, a two-port high -Q bandpass filter is estimated to achieve 7.26% operating frequency shifting by applying only 5 V of gate voltage. These kinds of elastic topological materials and corresponding devices can strongly promote the development of 2D-material-based nanoelectromechanical systems and might have immediate applications in modern wireless communication technology at radio or microwave frequencies.

ABSTRACT: Topological insulators are a new class of materials characterized by fully spin-polarized surface states, a linear dispersion, imperviousness to external non-magnetic perturbations, and a helical character arising out of the perpendicular spin-momentum locking. This article answers in a pedagogical way the distinction between a topological and normal insulator, the role of topology in band theory of solids, and the origin of these surface states. Numerical techniques including diagonalization of the TI Hamiltonians are described to quantitatively evaluate the behaviour of topological insulator states. The Hamiltonians based on continuum and tight binding approaches are contrasted. The application of TIs as components of a fast switching environment or channel material for transistors is examined through I-V curves. The potential pitfall of such devices is presented along with techniques that could potentially circumvent the problem. Additionally, it is demonstrated that a strong internal electric field can also induce topological insulator behaviour with wurtzite nitride quantum wells as representative materials.

ABSTRACT: Three-dimensional (3D) semimetals with fourfold degenerate Dirac points are of prominent importance in topological photonics as the parent states to Weyl nodes, line nodes, & etc. The dispersions on all the momentums' directions are linear, which represents that the Dirac point and topologically protected helicoid surface states may exist. Here, we have demonstrated an acoustic metamaterial with Dirac points by designing the sign of coupling terms, specifically incorporating negative couplings. Tuning the coupling parameter along longitudinal direction, the transition from 3D Dirac point to Weyl points can be obtained. In realistic topological metamaterial designing, the negative coupling is realized by inserting additional off-resonant sites. The simulated band dispersion clearly shows four-band crossing point. The helicoid surface states are also proved. Our study provides a new approach of constructing 3D topological phase and shows the transition between nodal ring and Dirac point. Our results can be the theoretical basement of topological protected devices.

ABSTRACT: We demonstrate that the parity-time (PT) symmetric interfaces formed between non-Hermitian amplifying (gainy) and lossy topological crystals exhibit PT phase transitions separating phases of lossless and decaying/amplifying topological edge transport. The spectrum of these interface states exhibits exceptional points (EPs) separating (i) a PT symmetric real-valued regime with an evenly distributed wave function in both gainy and lossy domains and (ii) a PT broken complex-valued regime, in which edge states asymmetrically localize in one of the domains. Despite its complex-valued character, the edge spectrum remains gapless and connects complex-valued bulk bands through the EPs. We find that the regimes exist when the real edge spectrum is embedded into the bulk continuum without mixing, indicating that the edge states are protected against leakage into the bulk by the PT symmetry. Two exemplary PT symmetric systems, exhibiting valley and Chern topological phases, respectively, are investigated and the connection with the corresponding Hermitian systems is established. Interestingly, despite the complex bulk spectrum of the Chern insulator, the bulk-interface correspondence principle still holds, as long as the topological gap remains open. The proposed systems are experimentally feasible in photonics, which is evidenced by our rigorous full-wave simulations of PT symmetric silicon-based photonic graphene.

ABSTRACT: We demonstrate that multiple higher-order topological transitions can be triggered via the continuous change of the geometry in kagome photonic crystals composed of three dielectric rods. By tuning a single geometry parameter, the photonic corner and edge states emerge or disappear with higher-order topological transitions. Two distinct higher-order topological insulator phases and a normal insulator phase are revealed. Their topological indices are obtained from symmetry representations. A photonic analog of the fractional corner charge is introduced to distinguish the two higher-order topological insulator phases. Our predictions can be readily realized and verified in configurable dielectric photonic crystals. (C) 2021 Chinese Laser Press

ABSTRACT: Structured light fields embody strong spatial variations of polarization, phase, and amplitude. Understanding, characterization, and exploitation of such fields can be achieved through their topological properties. Three-dimensional (3D) topological solitons, such as hopfions, are 3D localized continuous field configurations with nontrivial particle-like structures that exhibit a host of important topologically protected properties. Here, we propose and demonstrate photonic counterparts of hopfions with exact characteristics of Hopf fibration, Hopf index, and Hopf mapping from real-space vector beams to homotopic hyperspheres representing polarization states. We experimentally generate photonic hopfions with on-demand high-order Hopf indices and independently controlled topological textures, including Neel-, Bloch-, and antiskyrmionic types. We also demonstrate a robust free-space transport of photonic hopfions, thus showing the potential of hopfions for developing optical topological informatics and communications.

ABSTRACT: Two-dimensional (2D) materials have unique structural and optoelectronic properties and have very important applications in energy, environment, and high-performance optoelectronic sensing. Among them, the nonlinear optical properties and related applications are hot research fields. Herein, a novel 2D Bi2Te3-FeTe2 heterostructure is successfully prepared by Fe3+ induction and site-selective overgrowth using a seed-mediated growth method. This heterostructure has a plate-satellite geometry with an open spatially separated surface. The Z-scan measurement characterizes the nonlinear transmittance of the heterostructure and proves the broadband saturation absorption behavior experimentally, which are superior to those of some mainstream 2D materials. In addition, the femtosecond-transient absorption spectra reveal an ultrashort recovery time of 1.7 ps at pump wavelength of 780 nm. By integrating the Bi2Te3-FeTe2 saturable absorber into fiber laser, a 164.7-ps pulse and a 481-fs pulse are produced at center wavelengths of 1064 and 1550 nm, respectively, which are better than that of the Bi2Te3 nanoplate-based mode-locking. A new approach for the synthesis of 2D composites with spatially separated structures is provided. It is demonstrated that the synthesized Bi2Te3-FeTe2 heterojunction can be a promising broadband nonlinear optical material in ultrafast optical applications.

ABSTRACT: Recent advances in condensed matter physics have shown that the spin degree of freedom of electrons can be efficiently exploited in the emergent field of spintronics, offering unique opportunities for efficient data transfer, computing, and storage (1-3). These concepts have been inspiring analogous approaches in photonics, where the manipulation of an artificially engineered pseudospin degree of freedom can be enabled by synthetic gauge fields acting on light (4-6). The ability to control these degrees of freedom significantly expands the landscape of available optical responses, which may revolutionize optical computing and the basic means of controlling light in photonic devices across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. We demonstrate a new class of photonic systems, described by effective Hamiltonians in which competing synthetic gauge fields, engineered in pseudospin, chirality/sublattice, and valley subspaces, result in bandgap opening at one of the valleys, whereas the other valley exhibits Dirac-like conical dispersion. We show that this effective response has marked implications on photon transport, among which are as follows: (i) a robust pseudospin- and valley-polarized one-way Klein tunneling and (ii) topological edge states that coexist within the Dirac continuum for opposite valley and pseudospin polarizations. These phenomena offer new ways to control light in photonics, in particular, for on-chip optical isolation, filtering, and wave-division multiplexing by selective action on their pseudospin and valley degrees of freedom.

ABSTRACT: V-points are polarization singularities in linearly polarized optical fields characterized by topological index or Poincare-Hopf index which takes integer values, including zero. The diffraction of integer valued V-points are straight forward and a V-point disintegrates into two C-points upon diffraction. Here we report the diffraction of zero topological index V-points, having different spatial polarization distributions, through circular and triangular apertures. The diffracted filed, at the focal region of a converging lens, show some interesting intensity distributions when decomposed the total field into linear and circular orthogonal state of polarization.

ABSTRACT: Degeneracy is an omnipresent phenomenon in various physical systems, which has its roots in the preservation of geometrical symmetry. In electronic and photonic crystal systems, very often this degeneracy can be broken by virtue of strong interactions between photonic modes of the same energy, where the level repulsion and the hybridization between modes causes the emergence of photonic bandgaps. However, most often this phenomenon does not lead to a complete and inverted bandgap formation over the entire Brillouin zone. Here, by systematically breaking the symmetry of a two-dimensional square photonic crystal, we investigate the formation of Dirac points, line node singularities, and inverted bandgaps. The formation of this complete bandgap is due to the level repulsion between degenerate modes along the line nodes of a semimetal-like photonic crystal, over the entire Brillouin zone. Our numerical experiments are performed by a home-build numerical framework based on a multigrid finite element method. The developed numerical toolbox and our observations pave the way towards designing complete bandgap photonic crystals and exploring the role of symmetry on the optical behaviour of even more complicated orders in photonic crystal systems.

ABSTRACT: We study the diffraction pattern of a Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beam passing through a Y-shaped aperture (YA), which can be used to measure the topological charge (TC) of such a beam. This letter confirms that the magnitude and sign of the TC of the LG beam can be measured with a YA. We also study the effect of the YA with different sizes on the diffraction pattern. In addition, YA diffraction itself can be used to verify the measurement results of the sign of TC. The experimental results agree well with the simulation results. The method is simple and reliable.

ABSTRACT: The dual role played by symmetry in many-body physics manifests itself through two fundamental mechanisms: spontaneous symmetry breaking and topological symmetry protection. These two concepts, ubiquitous in both condensed matter and high energy physics, have been applied successfully in the last decades to unravel a plethora of complex phenomena. Their interplay, however, remains largely unexplored. Here we report how, in the presence of strong correlations, symmetry protection emerges from a set of configurations enforced by another broken symmetry. This mechanism spawns different intertwined topological phases, where topological properties coexist with long-range order. Such a singular interplay gives rise to interesting static and dynamical effects, including interaction-induced topological phase transitions constrained by symmetry breaking, as well as a self-adjusted fractional pumping. This work paves the way for further exploration of exotic topological features in strongly-correlated quantum systems.

ABSTRACT: We performed a comparative numerical study of the conservation of properties of individual Laguerre-Gauss beams and their superpositions in a random environment. The simulation is based on the extended Huygens-Fresnel principle. Studies have shown that increasing the number of rings of Laguerre-Gauss modes with the same vortex order allows one to increase the ratio of the energy of the minimum informative coefficient to the energy of the maximum parasitic coefficient, which is important when detecting information encoded in the coefficients. In addition, an increase in the number of rings partially compensates for the stronger effect of random fluctuations on beams with high topological charges. Such a positive impact can be explained by the structural redundancy of multi-ring distributions (the vortex phase structure of the beam is repeated in each ring). A similar result was obtained for beams corresponding to a two-mode superposition. The best result on information preservation was obtained for the superposition with duplication of information in complex conjugate coefficients, and the best ratio of informative energy to parasitic one was obtained for beams with the largest area.

ABSTRACT: We study the surface state-dependent magneto-optical properties of an ultrathin Floquet topological insulator (FTI) under the influence of an external perpendicular magnetic field in the terahertz frequency regime. Under the Floquet picture, we treat the circularly polarized off-resonant light as an external perturbation that introduces a mass gap at the Dirac cone, thus, making the surface state Dirac fermions massive. By tuning the optical field energy in the FTI thin-film system, various electronic phase transitions can be driven between the trivial insulator state and the band insulator state. Using Kubo formalism, we derive the real and imaginary parts of the longitudinal and Hall conductivities and demonstrate that these conductivities are sensitively influenced by the strength of the off-resonant optical field, magnetic field, and chemical potentials. On the other hand, topological insulators exhibit strong magneto-optic effects. We further compute the Kerr and Faraday rotation angles and show that giant Kerr and Faraday rotations can be achieved in a FTI thin film by external tuning knobs, such as magnetic and off-resonant optical fields. The Kerr and Faraday rotations in symmetric (top) and antisymmetric (bottom) topological surface states can be controlled for interband and intraband transitions via gate bias voltage. Our results reveal the FTI as an intriguing versatile system whose magneto-optical properties can be effectively tuned optically, magnetically and electrically, thus, uncovering the strong photonics and optoelectronics device application potentials of the FTI.

ABSTRACT: Weyl points are point degeneracies that occur in momentum space of 3D periodic materials and are associated with a quantized topological charge. Here, the splitting of a quadratic (charge-2) Weyl point into two linear (charge-1) Weyl points in a 3D micro-printed photonic crystal is observed experimentally via Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. Using a theoretical analysis rooted in symmetry arguments, it is shown that this splitting occurs along high-symmetry directions in the Brillouin zone. This micro-scale observation and control of Weyl points is important for realizing robust topological devices in the near-infrared.

ABSTRACT: We present a reconfigurable topological photonic system consisting of a 2D lattice of coupled ring resonators, with two sublattices of site rings coupled by link rings, which can be accurately described by a tight-binding model. Unlike previous coupled-ring topological models, the design is translationally invariant, similar to the Haldane model, and the nontrivial topology is a result of next-nearest couplings with nonzero staggered phases. The system exhibits a topological phase transition between trivial and spin Chern insulator phases when the sublattices are frequency detuned. Such topological phase transitions can be easily induced by thermal or electro-optic modulators, or nonlinear cross phase modulation. We use this lattice to design reconfigurable topological waveguides, with potential applications in on-chip photon routing and switching.

ABSTRACT: We investigate the topological edge modes of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) in a non-Hermitian system composed of graphene pair arrays with alternating gain and loss. The topological edge modes emerge when two topologically distinct graphene arrays are connected. The gain and loss present in the system provide additional ways to control the propagation loss and field distributions of the topological edge modes. Moreover, the existence of the topological edge modes is related to the broken parity-time (PT) symmetry. We show the beam diffraction can be steered by tuning the chemical potential of graphene. Thanks to the strong confinement of SPPs, the topological edge modes can be squeezed into a lateral width of similar to lambda/70. We also show such modes can be realized in lossy graphene waveguides without gain. The study provides a promising approach to realizing robust light transport and optical switches on a deep-subwavelength scale. (C) 2017 Optical Society of America

ABSTRACT: The sub-laser-cycle timescale of the electronic response to strong fields enables attosecond dynamical imaging in atoms, molecules and solids(1-4), with optical tunnelling and high-harmonic generation the hallmarks of attosecond optical spectroscopy(2,5-7). Topological insulators are intimately linked with electron dynamics, as manifested via the chiral edge currents(8), but it is unclear if and how topology leaves its mark on optical tunnelling and sub-cycle electronic response. Here, we identify distinct bulk topological effects on directionality and timing of currents arising during electron injection into conduction bands. We show that electrons tunnel differently in trivial and topological insulators, for the same band structure, and identify the key role of the Berry curvature in this process. These effects map onto topologically dependent attosecond delays and helicities of emitted harmonics that record the phase diagram of the system. Our findings create new roadmaps in studies of topological systems, building on the ubiquitous properties of the sub-laser-cycle strong-field response-a unique mark of attosecond science.

ABSTRACT: Dirac Fermion, as one of the basic particles in the particle physics, nowadays have been widely used to describe the electronic states with the behavior of Dirac fermion in the topological electronics. These exotic electronic states are called Dirac point, which exhibited as a linear crossing point in the band structure. Usually Dirac point is the topological phase transition point and thus viewed as the mother state of various topological states. As an analogue of topological electronics, topological photonics, also attracted a great deal of interest due to its potential application. One of the key topic in topological photonics is to realize photonic bands with Dirac point. In this review, we briefly introduce the progress of Dirac point in the photonic system and focus on the realization method of Dirac point in photonic crystal by take advantage of lattice symmetry. We also discuss Weyl point in the photonic crystal as an extension of the Dirac point.

ABSTRACT: Twisted bilayer two-dimensional electronic systems give rise to many exotic phenomena and unveil a new frontier for the study of quantum materials. In photonics, twisted two-dimensional systems cou-pled via near-field interactions offer a platform to study localization and lasing. Here, we theoretically propose that twisting can be an unprecedented tool to tune the performance of near-field thermopho-tovoltaic systems. Remarkably, through twisting-induced photonic topological transitions, we achieve significant tuning of the thermophotovoltaic energy efficiency and power. The underlying mechanism is related to the change of the photonic isofrequency contours from elliptical to hyperbolic geometries in a setup where the hexagonal-boron-nitride metasurface serves as the heat source and the indium-antimonide p -n junction serves as the cell. We find that a notably high energy efficiency, nearly 53 of the Carnot efficiency, can be achieved in our thermophotovoltaic system, while the output power can reach up to 1.1 x 104 W/m2 without requiring a large temperature difference between the source and the cell. Our results indicate the promising future of twisted near-field thermophotovoltaics and paves the way towards tunable, high-performance thermophotovoltaics and infrared detection.

ABSTRACT: The polarizations of topological edge modes in the vicinity of optical Weyl points were numerically studied in chiral photonic crystals. We investigated two kinds of rotationally stacked woodpile structures in which planar rod arrays were vertically stacked one-by-one with an in-plane rotation angle of 60 or 45 degrees. Both structures showed pairs of optical Weyl points having topological numbers of opposite signs for photonic bands in low orders. Topological edge states derived from the Weyl points appeared below the light line, and were strongly confined at the air interfaces in a length shorter than the wavelength. Their polarizations in a direction perpendicular to the propagation direction were found to be one particular circular polarization that depended on the handedness of the structural chirality. Since these chiral photonic crystals can be fabricated using semiconductor materials such as GaAs or Si, the obtained robust planar waveguides for circularly polarized light at the interface between air and the semiconductor structure can be useful not only in photonics but also in spintronics or quantum information technology through spin photon interfaces.

ABSTRACT: Topological rainbow trapping, which can separate and trap different frequencies of topological states into differ-ent positions, plays a key role in topological photonic devices. However, few schemes have been proposed to realize topological rainbow trapping effects in lossy photonic crystal systems, which has restricted their practical applications, since loss is ubiquitous in nanophotonic devices. Here, we propose a method to realize a topological rainbow based on non-Hermitian twisted piecing photonic crystals. Different frequencies of topological photonic states are separated and trapped in different positions without overlap in the lossy photonic crystals. Moreover, the frequencies of interface states can be modulated by loss, and a topological rainbow can also be achieved in both TE and TM modes. This work brings an effective method to realize robust nanophotonic multiwavelength devices in non-Hermitian systems.(c) 2022 Chinese Laser Press

ABSTRACT: We investigate the localization and topological transitions in a one-dimensional (interacting) non-Hermitian quasiperiodic lattice, which is described by a generalized Aubry-Andre-Harper model with irrational modulations in the off-diagonal hopping and on-site potential and with non-Hermiticities from the nonreciprocal hopping and complex potential phase. For noninteracting cases, we reveal that the nonreciprocal hopping (the complex potential phase) can enlarge the delocalization (localization) region in the phase diagrams spanned by two quasiperiodic modulation strengths. We show that the localization transition is always accompanied by a topological phase transition characterized the winding numbers of eigenenergies in three different non-Hermitian cases. Moreover, we find that a real-complex eigenenergy transition in the energy spectrum coincides with (occurs before) these two phase transitions in the nonreciprocal (complex potential) case, while the real-complex transition is absent with the coexistence of the two non-Hermiticities. For interacting spinless fermions, we demonstrate that the extended phase and the many-body localized phase can be identified by the entanglement entropy of eigenstates and the level statistics of complex eigenenergies. By making the critical scaling analysis, we further show that the many-body localization transition coincides with the real-complex transition and occurs before the topological transition in the nonreciprocal case, which are absent in the complex phase case.

ABSTRACT: Nodal lines are degeneracies formed by crossing bands in three-dimensional momentum space. Interestingly, these degenerate lines can chain together via touching points and manifest as nodal chains. These nodal chains are usually embedded in two orthogonal planes and protected by the corresponding mirror symmetries. Here, we propose and demonstrate an in-plane nodal chain in photonics, where all chained nodal lines coexist in a single mirror plane instead of two orthogonal ones. The chain point is stabilized by the intrinsic symmetry that is specific to electromagnetic waves at the ? point of zero frequency. By adding another mirror plane, we find a nodal ring that is constructed by two higher bands and links with the in-plane nodal chain. The nodal link in momentum space exhibits non-Abelian characteristics on a C2T - invariant plane, where admissible transitions of the nodal link structure are determined by generalized quaternion charges. Through near-field scanning measurements of bi-anisotropic metamaterials, we experimentally mapped out the in-plane nodal chain and nodal link in such systems.

ABSTRACT: Spin-controlled vortex generation and spin-Hall effect, two distinct effects discovered in optics, have been extensively studied recently. However, while physical origins of two effects are both due to spin-orbit interactions, their inherent connections remain obscure which also hinders further explorations on the manipulations of them. Here, in studying the scattering of a spin-polarized light beam at sharp interfaces, an intriguing phase transition between vortex generation and spin-Hall shift trigged by varying the incidence angle is revealed. After reflection/refraction, the beam contains two components: normal and abnormal modes acquiring spin-redirection-Berry phases and Pancharatnam-Berry phases, respectively. Inside the abnormal beam, two classes of wave components gain Pancharatnam-Berry phases with distinct topological natures, generating intrinsic and extrinsic orbital angular momenta (OAM), respectively. Enlarging incidence angle changes the relative portions of these two contributions, making the abnormal beam undergo a phase transition from vortex generation to spin-Hall shift. Such intriguing effect is experimentally observed at a purposely designed metamaterial slab, exhibiting efficiency enhanced by several-thousand times compared to that at a conventional slab. These findings unify two previously discovered effects in a single framework, reinterpret previous results with clearer pictures, and shed light on understanding other physical effects involving the competition between intrinsic and extrinsic OAM.

ABSTRACT: Coupled-waveguide devices are of central importance in on-chip photonic circuits. However, their performance usually suffers from high wavelength and structure sensitivity, which makes it challenging to achieve broadband and fabrication tolerant optical functions. Topological pumping of edge states has emerged as a promising route for robust light transport in coupled waveguides. Here, the Thouless pumping process is explored in finite Rice-Mele modeled silicon waveguide arrays and the robust power coupling and mode-order conversion are experimentally demonstrated in this system. Thanks to the topological protection of light transport, the directional coupler and mode-order converter based on the waveguide arrays show an ultrabroad bandwidth of 120 nm and are quite tolerant to significant structural deviations (-50-150 nm). As compared to the robust optical coupling in other topological waveguide arrays reported in recent works, the approach is more advantageous in terms of robustness against the variations in both waveguide width and gap distance, which is greatly favored in large-scale photonic integration. This work could serve as a design principle for a new class of broadband and fabrication tolerant coupled-waveguide devices, which can find applications in many fields including optical simulations of condensed matter physics, on-chip optical communications, and quantum information processing.

ABSTRACT: Photonic topological insulators enable topological boundary modes that are resilient to defects and disorder, irrespective of manufacturing precision. This property is known as topological protection. Although originally limited to dimensionality of modes one lower than that of topological insulators, the recently discovered higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs) offer topological protection over an extended range of dimensionalities. Here, we introduce a photonic HOTI with kagome lattice that exhibits topological bulk polarization, leading to the emergence of one-dimensional edge states, as well as higher-order zero-dimensional states confined to the corners of the structure. Interestingly, in addition to the corner states due to nearest-neighbour interactions, we discover a new class of topological corner states induced by long-range interactions and specific to photonic systems. Our findings demonstrate that photonic HOTIs possess richer physics than their condensed-matter counterparts, offering opportunities for engineering novel designer electromagnetic states with unique topological robustness. One- and zero-dimensional optical states are revealed in photonic higher-order topological insulators.

ABSTRACT: Topologically protected plasmonic modes located inside topological bandgaps are attracting increasing attention, chiefly due to their robustness against disorder-induced backscattering. Here, we introduce a bilayer graphene metasurface that possesses plasmonic topological valley interface modes when the mirror symmetry of the metasurface is broken by horizontally shifting the lattice of holes of the top layer of the two freestanding graphene layers in opposite directions. In this configuration, light propagation along the domain-wall interface of the bilayer graphene metasurface shows unidirectional features. Moreover, we have designed a molecular sensor based on the topological properties of this metasurface using the fact that the Fermi energy of graphene varies upon chemical doping. This effect induces strong variation of the transmission of the topological guided modes, which can be employed as the underlying working principle of gas sensing devices. Our work opens up new ways of developing robust integrated plasmonic devices for molecular sensing. (C) 2020 Optical Society of America

ABSTRACT: We study a plasmonic metasurface that supports pseudospin-dependent edge states confined at a subwavelength scale, considering full electrodynamic interactions including retardation and radiative effects. The spatial symmetry of the lattice of plasmonic nanoparticles gives rise to edge states with properties reminiscent of the quantum spin Hall effect in topological insulators. However, unlike the spin-momentum locking characteristic of topological insulators, these modes are not purely unidirectional and their propagation properties can be understood by analyzing the spin angular momentum of the electromagnetic field, which is inhomogeneous in the plane of the lattice. The local sign of the spin angular momentum determines the propagation direction of the mode under a near-field excitation source. We also study the optical response under far-field excitation and discuss in detail the effects of radiation and retardation.

Here, focusing on gated devices presenting inverted band ordering, we evidence an enhancement of the terahertz photoconductive response close to the charge neutrality point and at the magnetic field driven topological phase transition. We also show the ability of these heterostructures to be used as terahertz imagers. Regarding terahertz emitters, we present results on stimulated emission of HgCdTe heterostructures in their conventional semiconductor state above 30 THz, discussing the physical mechanisms involved and promising routes towards the 5-15 THz frequency domain.

ABSTRACT: Solitons attract a great deal of interest in many fields, ranging from optics to fluid mechanics, cosmology, particle physics and condensed matter. However, solitons of these very different types rarely coexist and interact with each other. Here we develop a system that hosts optical solitons coexisting with topological solitonic structures localized in the molecular alignment field of a soft birefringent medium. We experimentally demonstrate and theoretically explain optomechanical interactions between such optical and topological solitons, mediated by the local transfer of momentum between light and matter and the nonlocal orientational elasticity of the liquid-crystal phase used in our system. We show that the delicate balance arising from these different contributions to the optomechanical force enables facile dynamical control and spatial localization of topological solitons. Our findings reveal unusual solitonic tractor beams and emergent light-matter self-patterning phenomena that could aid in creating new breeds of nonlinear photonic materials and devices. Researchers demonstrate systems in which optical solitons coexist and interact with topological solitonic structures localized in the molecular alignment field of a soft birefringent medium. The findings could lead to solitonic tractor beams and new light-matter self-patterning phenomena.

ABSTRACT: Optical vector beams have great potential in many applications, for example optical tweezers, information transmission and processing, laser surface structuring, particle acceleration, and vortex dichroism spectroscopy. However, the reported vector beams in the terahertz (THz) spectral range are limited to exhibiting only low-order topological charges. Therefore, methodologies to generate THz vector beams bearing a tailored topological charge are highly desired. This work investigates how to generate THz vector beams with a tailored topological charge via the optical rectification process in a 111-cut ZnTe crystal pumped with a vector optical beam and how to manipulate the vector THz beam's polarization state through the initial polarization angle. We theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that the transduction process produces a THz topological charge twice that of the infrared pump, also admitting the opposite sign. Given the well-developed technology to design infrared vector beams, the proposed method can generate THz vector beams with tailored topological charges.

ABSTRACT: In the present work, we study the formation of topological edge states of bound photon pairs, doublons. We consider a one-dimensional array of optical microresonators with tunneling nearest-neighbor couplings, with two photons traveling along the array. Considering the interaction between photons that share the same resonator and taking into account two-photon tunneling processes, we construct a system that supports topological edge states of doublons and does not support any edge states in the single-photon regime. Thus, we provide an example of interaction-induced topological states of quantum light. To illustrate our findings, we perform an analog emulation of the proposed system applying topolectrical circuit platform. We demonstrate that the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian describing initial two-particle quantum problem can be exactly mapped to the eigenmodes of a two-dimensional classical electric circuit composed of inductors and capacitors. We realize such a circuit working at kHz frequencies and study it experimentally. After obtaining the signatures of the two-photon edge state in the resonance spectrum of the circuit, we perform a reconstruction of the corresponding eigenmode and thus provide the direct evidence of the edge state formation. To demonstrate the topological origin of this doublon edge state, we extract the associated topological invariant directly from the experimental data. Obtained experimental results fully support our theoretical predictions and provide valuable insights into topological protection in interacting quantum systems and its emulation with classical setups.

ABSTRACT: Photonic topological edge states in one-dimensional dimer chains have long been thought to be robust to structural perturbations by mapping the topological Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model of a solid-state system. However, the edge states at the two ends of a finite topological dimer chain will interact as a result of near-field coupling. This leads to deviation from topological protection by the chiral symmetry from the exact zero energy, weakening the robustness of the topological edge state. With the aid of non-Hermitian physics, the splitting frequencies of edge states can be degenerated again, with topological protection recovered by altering the gain or loss strength of the structure. This point of coalescence is known as the exceptional point (EP). The intriguing physical properties of EPs in topological structures give rise to many fascinating and counterintuitive phenomena. In this work, based on a finite non-Hermitian dimer chain composed of ultra-subwavelength resonators, we propose theoretically and verify experimentally that the sensitivity of topological edge states is greatly affected when the system passes through the EP. Using the EP of a non-Hermitian dimer chain, we realize a new sensor that is sensitive to perturbation of on-site frequency at the end of the structure and yet topologically protected from internal perturbation of site-to-site couplings. Our demonstration of a non-Hermitian topological structure with an EP paves the way for the development of novel sensors that are not sensitive to internal manufacturing errors but are highly sensitive to changes in the external environment.

ABSTRACT: We come up with a hybrid liquid exfoliation method to prepare bismuth telluride nanocrystals efficiently and cost-effectively. The nonlinear transmittance of the nanocrystals has been characterized with Z-scan technique, which can manifest its broadband saturable absorption behavior experimentally. The as-fabricated nanocrystals were integrated onto fiber end facet to form a fiber compatible nonlinear absorption device with optical deposition method, which was then used to modulate the fiber laser with different cavity configurations to deliver pulsed laser successfully. The noise-like pulse and dissipative soliton have been obtained with wavelength centered at 1562 nm and 1068 nm, respectively. These results confirm the effectiveness of the hybrid liquid exfoliation method to prepare bismuth telluride into nanocrystals, and the broadband nonlinear optical response and ultrafast photonics application potential of the nanocrystals.

ABSTRACT: The effective engineering of light absorption has been the focus of intensive research to realize the novel optoelectronic devices based on a topological insulator, a unique topologically protected surface Dirac-state quantum material with excellent prospects in electronics and photonics. Here, we theoretically proposed a versatile platform for manipulating the light-matter interaction employing the dynamically tunable coherent perfect absorption (CPA) in the topological insulator Bi1.5Sb0.5Te1.8Se1.2(BSTS). By simply varying the phase difference between two coherent counter-propagating beams, the BSTS-based CPA device can be continuously switched from the high transparency state to the strong absorption state, leading to the modulation of absorption ranging from 0.2% to 99.998%. Under the illumination of TE-polarized wave, the high absorption (>90%) can be implemented within a broad range from 0.47 to 1.51 mu m through a proper incident angle alteration. In addition, the quasi-CPA wavelength can be flexibly selected by tuning the bulk thickness of BSTS film while maintaining high modulation depth of 10(4). Such BSTS-based CPA device with flexible tunability, wide absorption modulation range, and high modulation depth is expected to be utilized in a wide range of potential applications such as in next-generation coherent detectors, coherent modulators, all-optical switches, and signal processors.

ABSTRACT: We demonstrate two kinds of stable ultrafast fiber lasers mode-locked by topological insulator (TI) Bi2Se3 nanosheets interacting with photonic crystal fiber (PCF). The saturable absorber (SA) produced by drying TI solution filled in 5.5 cm PCF provides a modulation depth of 5%, and its damage threshold is highly enhanced due to the large evanescent field interaction length. When the SA is incorporated in an erbium-doped fiber ring cavity with anomalous dispersion, a conventional soliton with 908-fs duration is obtained, and no wave-breaking and SA damage is ever shown, even for pump power at 900 mW. Through tuning polarization controller, as high as tenth harmonic mode-locking, namely, 202.7 MHz, is obtained, and it operates stably for 8 hours under lab conditions. Dissipative soliton with a duration of 7.564 ps is generated when the dispersion of cavity changes from anomalous to normal, which can be further compressed to 245 fs by additional 15-m single mode fiber, and a maximum average output of 75 mW is obtained. This TI nanosheets-PCF structure possesses advantages of stable saturable absorption performance, high damage threshold, and freedom from special package, which make it an effective choice for a passively mode-locked laser.

ABSTRACT: Topological metamaterials are a new class of materials that support topological modes such as edge modes and interface modes, which are commonly immune to scattering and imperfections. This novelty has been the subject of extensive research in many branches of physics such as electronics, photonics, phononics, and acoustics. The nontrivial topological properties related to the presence of topological modes are tipically found in periodic media. However, it was recently demonstrated that structures called quasicrystals may also exhibit nontrivial topological behavior attributed to dimensions higher than that of the quasicrystal. While quasiperiodicity has received a lot of attention in the fields of crystallography and photonics, research into quasiperiodic elastic structures has been scarce. In this paper, we show how the concepts of quasiperiodicity may be applied to the design of topological mechanical metamaterials. We start by investigating the boundary modes present in quasiperiodic 1D phononic lattices. These modes have the interesting property of being localized at either one of the two different boundaries depending on the value of an additional parameter, which is remnant of the higher dimension. A smooth variation of this parameter in either time or a spatial dimension can lead to a robust transfer of energy between two sites of the structure. We present an idealized mechanical system composed by an array of coupled rods that may be used as a platform for realizing this kind of robust transfer of energy. These are preliminary investigations into a entirely new class of structures which may lead to novel engineering applications.

ABSTRACT: Topological phases have become an enabling role in exploiting new applications of nonlinear optics in recent years. Here we theoretically propose a valley photonic crystal resonator emulating topologically pro-tected dissipative Kerr soliton combs. It is shown that topological resonator modes can be observed in the resonator. Moreover, we also simulate the dynamic evolution of the topological resonator with the injection of a continuous-wave pump laser. We find that the topological optical frequency combs evolve from Turing rolls to chaotic states, and eventually into single soliton states. More importantly, such dissipative Kerr soliton combs generated in the resonator are inborn topologically protected, showing robustness against sharp bends and structural disorders. Our design supporting topologically protected dissipative Kerr soliton combs could be implemented experimentally in on-chip nanofabricated photonic devices.

ABSTRACT: We present an inverse-design approach to significantly improve the figures of merit for chiral photonics with quantum emitters in topological photonic crystal slab waveguides. Beginning with a topological waveguide mode with a group index of approximately 10 and a maximum forward or backward Purcell factor at a chiral point of less than 0.5, we perform optimizations of the directional Purcell factor. We use a fully three-dimensional guided-mode expansion method to efficiently calculate waveguide band-dispersion properties and modes, while automatic differentiation is employed to calculate the gradient of objective functions. We present two example improved designs: (i) a topological mode with an accessible group index of approximately 30 and a maximum unidirectional Purcell factor at a chiral point greater than 4.5, representing a nearly 10-fold improvement to the Purcell factor, and (ii) a slow-light mode well away from the Brillouin-zone edge with a group index greater than 350 and a maximum unidirectional Purcell factor at a chiral point greater than 45.

ABSTRACT: We have theoretically and experimentally demonstrated subwavelength acoustic energy harvesting via topological interface states in 1D Helmholtz resonator arrays. The system can produce two types of bandgaps in the subwavelength realm due to the resonance and band folding mechanism, respectively. Through the analyses of the Zak phase and eigenfield distributions, the topological properties of band-folding-induced gaps can be changed by tuning the lattice structural parameters, while those of resonant gaps maintain stability. When two different arrays are spliced together, topological interface states will appear in the band-folding-induced band gaps but do not exist in the resonant gaps. The experimental measurements agree well with the theoretical prediction. Our study expands the applicability of acoustic topological insulators in a compacted platform.

ABSTRACT: The topological charge of integral vortex beams with a single circle of multipoints has previously been measured. In this work, we theoretically and experimental study the diffraction patterns of vortex beams of integral and fractional topological charges using a single circle and two circles of multipoint plates. It is found that the diffraction patterns are dependent not only on the multipoint plates, but also on the topological charge of the vortex beams. On the basis of this property, we can measure the topological charges of integral and fractional vortex beams. (C) 2011 The Japan Society of Applied Physics

ABSTRACT: Planar metasurfaces with phase gradient exhibit unprecedented abilities in freely controlling light propagation. On the other hand, only a few studies have been devoted to unveiling the light scattering properties of cylindrical metasurfaces. Here we propose and study a metallic cylinder with a phase gradient obtained by engineering the gradient of grooves on its outer surface. We find that structural topological charges may be generated by the phase gradient in the meta-cylinder that, in turn, may be exploited to manipulate light scattering with orbital angular momentum (OAM) and obtain a new conservation law for OAM. Remarkably, at variance with results obtained by conventional core-shell structures, high-efficiency and multichannel OAM conversion/absorption may be realized with a single meta-cylinder, as we prove by theoretical analysis and numerical simulations. Moreover, owing to the transition of the diffraction channel and Ohmic loss in metal, asymmetric response to light is observed for incident OAM with opposite helicity. Our results open up a new train of thought for manipulating light scattering with OAM and pave the way to further versatile applications involving the manipulation of OAM with meta-objects.

ABSTRACT: Here, we study a superposition of Bessel-Gaussian beams with topological charges (TC) m and n. We prove theoretically that continuous varying the amplitudes of the constituent beams allows controlling the TC of the entire superposition. We obtain the conditions, when the TC is equal to n or m. In the cross-section of such a superposition, there is an m-order optical vortex (if m < n) and n - m unitary-charge vortices residing in the beam periphery. If the amplitudes of both constituent beams become equal, we show that peripheral optical vortices move away to infinity and that TC becomes half-integer. In addition, this TC is conserved on free space propagation. Fractional part of this TC is, however, hidden in infinity.

ABSTRACT: We investigate topological features of a one-dimensional photonic quasicrystal within the context of PT symmetry. Via the scattering characteristics, we analyze various properties of a particular mirrored structure, which supports topological edge modes in its band gaps. These interface modes display a nontrivial dependence on the quasiperiodic geometry, even in a passive system. Subsequently, the tailored addition of gain and loss generates curious PT-like features. For example, the quasicrystal high density of modes leads to complicated mode-merging behaviors between edge and band modes, such as the symmetry recovery phenomenon. Furthermore, anisotropic transmission resonances (connected with unidirectional invisibility) are also present, but they display richer patterns in comparison to previously studied periodic structures. Additionally, we examine lasing effects in detail, with numerics and a simple Fabry-Perot model. The large variety of mode-merging behaviors opens the way to laser resonance engineering.

ABSTRACT: The PT-symmetry breaking for topological defect-states are studied in SSH micro-resonator laser arrays. For defect modes, the PT-symmetry breaking threshold reduces when the coupling strength between closely paired elements is increased. Such topological defect-modes are demonstrated in a 16-ring SSH PT-laser arrangement.

ABSTRACT: Weyl points, which are the degenerate points in three-dimensional momentum space, have been widely studied in the photonic system, and show some intriguing phenomena such as topologically protected surface states and chiral anomalies. Type-I Weyl systems possess a complete bandgap, and topologically protected surface states can be excited without disturbing the bulk states. In this work, we investigate the influence of the sign of coupling coefficient on the topological property of the system and find that type-I Weyl points can be realized by introducing a negative coupling between the stacking layers of the designed photonic crystal. We propose a new strategy to construct a type-I Weyl system by stacking the hexagonal photonic lattice. Different from the topological nontrivial photonic system with a positive coefficient, the negative couplings in the photonic system are realized by adding another resonating site between stacking layers. We theoretically demonstrate that the effective coupling between the resonating sites in adjacent layers sign-flips through the judicious design of the nearest coupling strength and eigenfrequency of the additional sites. The surface states at opposite boundaries of the proposed system have opposite group velocities, which is the feature of type-I Weyl points. Our study provides a new method of exploring topologically protected photonic systems and developing possible topological devices.

ABSTRACT: Terahertz (THz) topological photonic insulators have great potential in sixth generation (6G) wireless communication, which can support bit-error-free THz signal transport due to their topological robustness. However, previous works are mostly focused on the topological edge states that exhibit unidirectional transmission, low backscattering and robustness against structural defects and local disorder, and have ignored the bulk states of the topological structures. Here, we propose an exotic THz topological photonic crystal (TPC) with the valley Hall photonic structures, which presents a newly emerging photonic bandgap between the edge and bulk states when tuned by dual parameters. The introduction of the dual parameter adjustment can improve the design freedom. The exotic TPCs with the broadband valley edge and photonic bandgap are promising in designing THz functional devices.

ABSTRACT: Topological edge solitons that bifurcate and inherit topological protection from linear edge states and, therefore, demonstrate immunity to disorder and defects upon propagation, attract considerable attention in a rapidly growing field of topological photonics. Valley Hall systems are especially interesting from the point of view of re-alization of topological edge solitons because they do not require external or artificial magnetic fields or longitu-dinal modulations of the underlying potential for the emergence of the topological phases. Here we report on the diverse types of vector valley Hall edge solitons forming at the domain walls between superhoneycomb lattices, including bright-dipole, bright-tripole, dark-bright, and dark-dipole solitons. In contrast to conventional scalar topological solitons, such vector states can be constructed as envelope solitons on the edge states from different branches and with different Bloch momenta. Such vector solitons can be remarkably robust, they show stable long-distance propagation and can bypass sharp bends of the domain wall. The existence of the counter -propagating valley Hall edge solitons at the same domain wall allows us to study their structural robustness upon collisions that can be nearly elastic. Our results illustrate richness of soliton families in the valley Hall sys-tems and open new prospects for the light field manipulation and design of the nonlinear topological functional devices.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: In recent times, the optical-analogous skyrmions, topological quasiparticles with sophisticated vectorial structures in light, have received an increasing amount of interest. Here we propose theortically and experimentally a generalized family of these, the tunable optical skyrmions, unveiling a new mechanism to transform between various skyrmionic topologies, including Neel, Bloch, and antiskyrmion types, via simple parametric tuning. In addition, a geometric Skyrme-Poincare ' representation is proposed to visualize the complete topological evolution of tunable skyrmions, which we term the skyrmion torus. To generate the tunable optical skyrmions experimentally, we implemented a digital hologram system based on a spatial light modulator, the results of which show great agreement with our theoretical predictions.

ABSTRACT: Liquid crystals are widely known for their technological uses in displays, electro-optics, photonics and nonlinear optics, but these applications typically rely on defining and switching non-topological spatial patterns of the optical axis. Here, we demonstrate how a liquid crystal's optical axis patterns with singular vortex lines can robustly steer beams of light. External stimuli, including an electric field and light itself, allow us to reconfigure these unusual light-matter interactions. Periodic arrays of vortices obtained by photo-patterning enable the vortex-mediated fission of optical solitons, yielding their lightning-like propagation patterns. Predesigned patterns and spatial trajectories of vortex lines in high-birefringence liquid crystals can steer light into closed loops or even knots. Our vortex lattices might find technological uses in beam steering, telecommunications, virtual reality implementations and anticounterfeiting, as well as possibly offering a model system for probing the interaction of light with defects, including the theoretically predicted, imagination-capturing light-steering action of cosmic strings, elusive defects in cosmology.

ABSTRACT: The breathing honeycomb lattice hosts a topologically non-trivial bulk phase due to the crystalline-symmetry of the system. Pseudospin-dependent edge states, which emerge at the interface between trivial and non-trivial regions, can be used for the directional propagation of energy. Using the plasmonic metasurface as an example system, we probe these states in the near- and far-field using a semi-analytical model. We provide the conditions under which directionality was observed and show that it is source position dependent. By probing with circularly-polarised magnetic dipoles out of the plane, we first characterise modes along the interface in terms of the enhancement of source emissions due to the metasurface. We then excite from the far-field with non-zero orbital angular momentum beams. The position-dependent directionality holds true for all classical wave systems with a breathing honeycomb lattice. Our results show that a metasurface in combination with a chiral two-dimensional material, could be used to guide light effectively on the nanoscale.

ABSTRACT: Harnessing the dynamics of complex quantum systems is an area of much interest and a quantum simulator has emerged as a promising platform to probe exotic topological phases. Since the flexibility offered by various controllable quantum systems has helped gain insight into the quantum simulation of such complicated problems, an analog quantum simulator has recently shown its feasibility to tackle the problems of exploring topological phases. However, digital quantum simulation and the detection of topological phases still remain elusive. Here, we develop and experimentally realize the digital quantum simulation of topological phases with a solid-state quantum simulator at room temperature. Distinct from previous works dealing with static topological phases, the topological phases emulated here are Floquet topological phases. Furthermore, we also illustrate the procedure of digitally simulating a quantum quench and observing the nonequilibrium dynamics of Floquet topological phases. Using a quantum quench, the 0- and p-energy topological invariants are unambiguously detected through measuring time-averaged spin polarizations. We believe our experiment opens up a new avenue to digitally simulate and detect Floquet topological phases with fast-developed programmable quantum simulators. (C) 2020 Chinese Laser Press

ABSTRACT: Quantum light is characterized by distinctive statistical distributions that are possible only because of quantum mechanical effects. For example, single photons and correlated photon pairs exhibit photon number distributions with variance lower than classically allowed limits. This enables high-fidelity transmission of quantum information and sensing with lower noise than possible with classical light sources(1,2). Most quantum light sources rely on spontaneous parametric processes such as down-conversion and four-wave mixing(2). These processes are mediated by vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. Therefore, by manipulating the electromagnetic mode structure, for example with dispersion-engineered nanophotonic systems, the spectrum of generated photons can be controlled(3-7). However, disorder, which is ubiquitous in nanophotonic fabrication, causes device-to-device spectral variations(8-11). Here we realize topologically robust electromagnetic modes and use their vacuum fluctuations to create a quantum light source in which the spectrum of generated photons is much less affected by fabrication-induced disorder. Specifically, we use the topological edge states realized in a two-dimensional array of ring resonators to generate correlated photon pairs by spontaneous four-wave mixing and show that they outperform their topologically trivial one-dimensional counterparts in terms of spectral robustness. We demonstrate the non-classical nature of the generated light and the realization of a robust source of heralded single photons by measuring the conditional antibunching of photons, that is, the reduced likelihood of photons arriving together compared to thermal or laser light. Such topological effects, which are unique to bosonic systems, could pave the way for the development of robust quantum photonic devices.

ABSTRACT: Nanomaterials have demonstrated excellent mechanical, thermal, optical, and electrical properties in various fields, including 1D carbon nanotubes, as well as 2D materials starting from graphene. Metal-based nanomaterials, mainly divided into metal and metal oxide nanoparticles, also gradually come into the sight of ultrafast photonics applications due to the outstanding optical properties. The optical properties of metal nanoparticles can be enhanced by the interaction between conduction electrons with electric fields that is called surface plasmon resonance. As for metal oxide nanoparticles, optical properties are closely related to bandgap structures. When it comes to transition metal oxides, other phenomena also play important roles in optical absorption such as spin inversion and excitons of iron. Moreover, preparation methods of materials are also crucial for their properties and further applications. Therefore, in this review, commonly used physical and chemical fabrication methods for metal-based nanomaterials are first introduced. Then the optical properties of typical metal and metal oxide nanoparticles are discussed specifically. In addition, the applications of metal-based nanomaterials in ultrafast lasers based on mode-locked and Q-switched techniques are also summarized. Finally, a summary and outlook toward the synthesis, optical properties, and applications in ultrafast photonics of metal-based nanomaterials are presented.

ABSTRACT: The transfer of information between topological edge states is a robust way of spatially manipulating spatial states in lattice environments. This method is particularly efficient when the edge modes are kept within the topological gap of the lattice during the transfer. In this work, we show experimentally the transfer of photonic modes between topological edge states located at opposite ends of a dimerized one-dimensional photonic lattice. We use a diamond lattice of coupled waveguides and show that the topological transfer is insensitive to the presence of a high density of states in the form of a flat band at an energy close to that of the edge states and prevails in the presence of a hopping impurity. We explore the dynamics in the waveguide lattice using a wavelength-scan method, where different input wavelengths translate into different effective lattice lengths. Our results offer an alternative way to the implementation of efficient transfer protocols based on active driving mechanisms.

ABSTRACT: Surface plasmons are collective oscillations of electrons that can enable confinement of electromagnetic energy to subwavelength scales. Recent progress in plasmonics has largely relied on noble metals which are not CMOS compatible. Hence there is a need to search for new plasmonic materials. Here we show that the topological insulator Bi2Te2Se is plasmonic, and we study the distinct surface plasmons arising from its bulk and surface state. We launch propagating plasmon via a nanoscale slit and detect it using near-field scanning optical microscopy. We observe that the wavelength of plasmon that originated from the surface state is very short, more than 100 times smaller than the incident light wavelength, in sharp contrast to the plasmon wavelength of the bulk which is on the order of the incident light wavelength. This short plasmon wavelength is due to the two-dimensional nature of the surface state, similar to that in graphene. The strong optical confinement of the surface state plasmons can be exploited for various applications including integrated optical circuits and subwavelength optical devices.

ABSTRACT: In comparison with conventional lasers, topological lasers are more robust and can be immune to disorder or defects if lasing occurs in topologically protected states. Previously reported topological lasers were almost exclusively based on the first-order photonic topological insulators. Here, we show that lasing can be achieved in the zero-dimensional corner state in a second-order photonic topological insulator, which is based on the Kagome waveguide array with a rhombic configuration. If gain is present in the corner of the structure, where the topological corner state resides, stable lasing in this state is achieved, with the lowest possible threshold, in the presence of uniform losses and two-photon absorption. When gain acts in other corners of the structure, lasing may occur in edge or bulk states, but it requires substantially larger thresholds, and transition to stable lasing occurs over much larger propagation distances, sometimes due to instabilities, which are absent for lasing in corner states. We find that increasing two-photon absorption generally plays strong stabilizing action for nonlinear lasing states. The transition to stable lasing stimulated by noisy inputs is illustrated. Our work demonstrates the realistic setting for corner state lasers based on higher-order topological insulators realized with waveguide arrays.

ABSTRACT: The plasmon opens up the possibility to efficiently couple light and matter at subwavelength scales. In general, the plasmon frequency, intensity, and damping are dependent on the carrier density. These dependencies, however, are disadvantageous for stable functionalities of plasmons and render fundamentally a weak intensity at low frequency, especially for the Dirac plasmon (DP) widely studied in graphene. Here we demonstrate a new type of DP, emerging from a Dirac nodal-surface state, which can simultaneously exhibit a density-independent frequency, intensity, and damping. Remarkably, we predict the realization of anomalous DP (ADP) in 1D topological electrides, such as Ba3CrN3 and Sr3CrN3, by first-principles calculations. The ADPs in both systems have a density-independent frequency and high intensity, and their frequency can be tuned from terahertz to midinfrared by changing the excitation direction. Furthermore, the intrinsic weak electron-phonon coupling of anionic electrons in electrides affords an added advantage of low-phonon-assisted damping and hence a long lifetime of the ADPs. Our Letter paves the way to developing novel plasmonic and optoelectronic devices by combining topological physics with electride materials.

ABSTRACT: The symmetry breaking of grand unified gauge groups in the early Universe often leaves behind relic topological defects such as cosmic strings, domain walls, or monopoles. For some symmetry breaking chains, hybrid defects can form where cosmic strings attach to domain walls or monopoles attach to strings. In general, such hybrid defects are unstable, with one defect eating the other via the conversion of its rest mass into the other's kinetic energy and, subsequently, decaying via gravitational waves. In this work, we determine the gravitational wave spectrum from 1) the destruction of a cosmic string network by the nucleation of monopoles which cut up and eat the strings, 2) the collapse and decay of a monopole-string network by strings that eat the monopoles, 3) the destruction of a domain wall network by the nucleation of string-bounded holes on the wall that expand and eat the wall, and 4) the collapse and decay of a string-bounded wall network by walls that eat the strings. We call the gravitational wave signals produced from the eating of one topological defect by another gravitational wave gastronomy. We find that the four gravitational wave gastronomy signals considered yield unique spectra that can be used to narrow down the SO(10) symmetry breaking chain to the Standard Model and the scales of symmetry breaking associated with the consumed topological defects. Moreover, the systems we consider are unlikely to have a residual monopole or domain wall problem.

ABSTRACT: The two-dimensional optical topological insulators have exhibited a series of novel optical behaviors, especially the topologically protected edge states. We theoretically locate an initial excited quantum emitter (QE) in the two-dimensional ring resonator array and analyze the evolution of the QE in three kinds structures, i.e., topologically nontrivial, trivial, and graphene structure. We found that the dynamic evolution in the nontrivial topological structure is much different from that in the trivial and the graphene structures. When the QE excites edge states in nontrivial structures, the excited edge states can detour along the boundary and re-interact coherently with the QE, resulting in the recovery of the QE population. However, this repeated energy exchange is incomplete, depending on the coupling g between the QE and the resonator. More importantly, we check the influence of the QE's position and the coupling g (between the QE and the resonator) on dynamic evolution of the whole system. For the nontrivial structure, the effective excitation of edge states by the QE requires that: (1) the QE is located in the resonator in boundary and (2) g is much less than coupling coefficient J (between neighbor resonators). When g is much larger than J, the QE cannot excite edge states anymore. We give the critical value gc and find that it relates to band gap and size. Our paper is conducive to an in-depth understanding of the interaction between light and matter in optical topological insulators and provides a useful reference for quantum communication and quantum computing mediated by topological photonics.

ABSTRACT: Artificial neural network is a mathematical model or computational model that mimics the structure and function of biological neural networks and is used to estimate or approximate functions. We train the artificial neuron network with the dataset based on the structural and material parameter with special method to predict the geometric phases of some certain bands in 1D photonic crystals. It shows that the well-trained network can accurately predict the topological characteristics of the band structure and has good adaptability and adjust-ability for more complex structural parameters of the photonic crystal. At the same time, the use of the network can improve the efficiency of the calculation for photonic crystal topological properties and lay a good foundation for the reverse design of photonic crystal materials.

ABSTRACT: Resonance between light and object is highly desired in optical manipulation because the optical forces reach maximum values in this case. However, in traditional waveguide structures, the resonant interaction also greatly perturbs the incident field and weakens or completely destroys the manipulation on the subsequent particles. In order to avoid this dilemma, we propose to perform optical manipulation in a topological photonic structure. Owing to the topological protection, the light mode can almost keep its original form when an object is being manipulated. Therefore, resonant optical sorting can be achieved in a multiple and high throughput manner. The mechanism and results presented here pave the way for efficient on-chip optical sorting for biophysical and bio- chemical analysis. (C) 2022 Chinese Laser Press

ABSTRACT: There is enormous interest in engineering topological photonic systems. Despite intense activity, most works on topological photonic states (and more generally bosonic states) amount in the end to replicating a well-known fermionic single-particle Hamiltonian. Here we show how the squeezing of light can lead to the formation of qualitatively new kinds of topological states. Such states are characterized by non-trivial Chern numbers, and exhibit protected edge modes, which give rise to chiral elastic and inelastic photon transport. These topological bosonic states are not equivalent to their fermionic (topological superconductor) counterparts and, in addition, cannot be mapped by a local transformation onto topological states found in particle-conserving models. They thus represent a new type of topological system. We study this physics in detail in the case of a kagome lattice model, and discuss possible realizations using nonlinear photonic crystals or superconducting circuits.

ABSTRACT: We study a one-dimensional model of interacting bosons coupled to a dynamical Z(2) field, the Z(2) Bose-Hubbard model, and analyze the interplay between spontaneous symmetry breaking and topological symmetry protection. In a previous work, we showed how this model exhibits a spontaneous breaking of the translational symmetry through a bosonic Peierls transition. Here we find how, at half filling, the resulting phase also displays topological features that coexist with the presence of long-range order and yields a topological bond order wave. Using both analytical and numerical methods, we describe the properties of this phase, showing that it cannot be adiabatically connected to a topological phase of noninteracting bosons, and thus constitutes an instance of an interaction-induced symmetry-breaking topological insulator.

ABSTRACT: In this work, topologically-protected plasmon transport is demonstrated in graphenebased plasmonic crystal waveguides, the main ideas being subsequently applied to optically and chemically controllable nanodevices. In two configurations of topological graphene metasurfaces created by breaking their inversion symmetry, symmetry-protected Dirac cones associated to the underlying metasurfaces are gapped out, which leads to the formation of topological valley modes inside the nontrivial bandgap. The propagation of the corresponding topological modes shows unidirectional characteristics in both cases. Based on the proposed plasmonic topological waveguides, an active optical nanoswitch and a gas molecular sensor are designed by optically and chemically tuning the frequency dispersion of graphene metasurfaces via Kerr effect and gas molecular absorption, respectively. Specifically, the variation of the frequency dispersion of graphene can switch the topological mode into the region of leaky bulk modes, resulting in a dramatic variation of the plasmon transmission. Our work may contribute to the development of new ultracompact and ultrafast active photonic nanodevices based on graphene.

ABSTRACT: "The emerging field of topological photonics has extended our capability to control and manipulate electromagnetic waves. Thus far, however, research has focused on realizing defect-immune waveguides for on-chip communication. Making similar advancement for antennas, which are an integral component and crucial to the performance of wireless devices, could lead to a parallel impact on wireless communication. In particular, the requirement for impedance matching that is fundamental to current antenna technology constitutes a major limitation to transmitting and receiving free-space signals in terms of bandwidth and power efficiency. Here, we show how reciprocal photonic topological insulator (PTI) metasurfaces can be designed to enable a unique radiation mechanism needless of impedance matching. This relies on the fact that counter-propagating spin states are decoupled from each other  hence, this self-matching characteristic spans the entire bandwidth of the PTI's bandgap. Specifically, we present two strategies for out-coupling spin-polarized edge modes: (1) in the form of an end-fire antenna at the abrupt termination of the PTI with free space and (2) in the form of a leaky-wave antenna by engineering the dispersion of the edge mode to lie above the light line. In the first approach, we compare our results to conventional rectangular waveguide apertures and planar Vivaldi antennas, which either have a large profile or flared ends to obtain gradual impedance matching. In the second approach, we demonstrate how our structure can emit orbital angular momentum (OAM) beams with various orbital charge numbers by simply varying the length of the PTI interface when made into a circular loop. The reduced device area and complexity due to removing the need for any matching network and the ability to easily multiplex OAMs of any charge, in addition to the wideband and high efficiency performance, make the proposed topological antennas highly attractive for many applications."

While in the past only rather simple geometries like diamond, square, or hexagonal lattices were studied, we focus onto more complex photonic structures. Among them, we will present anisotropic triangular lattices, superlattices and three-dimensional lattices. We also study the propagation and localization of light in these structures - from simple waveforms to complex topological structures carrying phase dislocations.

ABSTRACT: We report the formation of photonic skyrmion defectsin split plasmonicvortices upon the broken rotational symmetry of the electromagneticfield in the presence of spin-orbit interaction. By employingthe interaction between light and a partially chiral metallic structure,we demonstrate the split of high order plasmonic vortices to the onewith unit topological charge, where antivortices in the Poynting vectorare assigned at the vicinity, giving rise to the spin reversal andconstruction of skyrmion defects with antiskyrmionic topology. Inaddition, we reveal the topological charge constraints for skyrmiondefects from the conservation of angular momentum and vortex winding,manifesting the stability of skyrmions induced by plasmonic vortexwith different order. The results provide new insights on spin-orbitinteraction and photonic topological textures, which may pave theway for their applications in optical metrology, sensing, and storage.

ABSTRACT: A free-electron-based vortex Smith-Purcell radiation with the higher-order topological charge is proposed in this paper based on uniform helical grating. Due to the spiral constraint of azimuth, the evanescent field of the electron beam will be diffracted and possess the orbital angular momentum. When the wave vectors of the diffraction wave match those of the free space, the vortex beam will be generated with different topological charges. Moreover, the higher-order topological charge can be affirmatively generated by utilizing the higher spatial harmonics according to Bloch's theorem of the helical periodic system. Moreover, the vortex beam with mixed orbital angular momentum can also be achieved. Furthermore, and the mode purities of these vortex beams are analyzed. The proposed scheme may facilitate the journey of the vortex beam from optical into terahertz band.

ABSTRACT: Inspired by concepts developed for fermionic systems in the framework of condensed matter physics, topology and topological states are recently being explored also in bosonic systems. Recently, some of these concepts have been successfully applied to acoustic phonons in nanoscale multilayered systems. The reported demonstration of confined topological phononic modes was based on Raman scattering spectroscopy [M. Esmann et al., Phys. Rev. B 97, 155422 ( 2018)], yet the resolution did not suffice to determine lifetimes and to identify other acoustic modes in the system. Here, we use time-resolved pump-probe measurements using an asynchronous optical sampling (ASOPS) technique to overcome these resolution limitations. By means of one-dimensional GaAs/AlAs distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) used as building blocks, we engineer high frequency (similar to 200 GHz) topological acoustic interface states. We are able to clearly distinguish confined topological states from stationary band edge modes. The generation/detection scheme reflects the symmetry of the modes directly through the selection rules, evidencing the topological nature of the measured confined state. These experiments enable a new tool in the study of the more complex topology-driven phonon dynamics such as phonon nonlinearities and optomechanical systems with simultaneous confinement of light and sound.

ABSTRACT: We theoretically investigate the application of topological plasmon polaritons (TPPs) to achieving robust temperature sensing. Based on an analogy of the topological edge states in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, TPPs are realized in a one-dimensional intrinsic indium antimonide (InSb) microsphere chain. The existence of TPPs is demonstrated by analyzing the topology of the photonic band structures and the eigenmode distribution. Due to the temperature dependence of the permittivity of InSb in the terahertz range, the resonance frequency of TPPs can be largely tuned by the temperature. The temperature susceptibility of the TPP resonance frequency can be as high as 0.0264 THz/K at room temperature, leading to a figure of merit over 150. Based on calculations on the optical local density of states (LDOS) near the chain, it is shown that the temperature susceptibility of TPPs is experimentally detectable via near-field probing techniques. Numerical results also indicate the sensing performance is immune to disorder. We further propose a robust and practical calibration method to correctly obtain the peak frequency of the LDOS spectrum due to the TPPs and then the temperature susceptibility, which is based on the ratio between the LDOS of a topological chain and that of a nontopological one. These TPPs can be potential candidates for robust temperature sensing, for which several experimental considerations are further discussed.

ABSTRACT: We show that the evolution of two-component particles governed by a two-dimensional spin-orbit lattice Hamiltonian can reveal transitions between topological phases. A kink in the mean width of the particle distribution signals the closing of the band gap, a prerequisite for a quantum phase transition between topological phases. Furthermore, for realistic and experimentally motivated Hamiltonians, the density profile in topologically nontrivial phases displays characteristic rings in the vicinity of the origin that are absent in trivial phases. The results are expected to have an immediate application to systems of ultracold atoms and photonic lattices.

ABSTRACT: The engineering of synthetic materials characterized by more than one class of topological invariants is one of the current challenges of solid-state based and synthetic materials. Using a synthetic photonic lattice implemented in a two-coupled ring system we engineer an anomalous Floquet metal that is gapless in the bulk and shows simultaneously two different topological properties. On the one hand, this synthetic lattice presents bands characterized by a winding number. The winding emerges from the breakup of inversion symmetry, and it directly relates to the appearance of Bloch suboscillations within its bulk. On the other hand, the Floquet nature of the lattice results in well-known anomalous insulating phases with topological edge states. The combination of broken inversion symmetry and periodic time modulation studied here enriches the variety of topological phases available in lattices subject to Floquet driving and suggests the possible emergence of novel phases when periodic modulation is combined with the breakup of spatial symmetries.

ABSTRACT: An ultra-compact one-dimensional topological photonic crystal (1D-TPC) is designed in a single mode silicon bus-waveguide to generate the Fano resonance lineshape. The Fano resonance comes from the interference between the discrete topological boundary state of the 1D-TPC and the continuum high-order leaky mode of the bus-waveguide. Standalone asymmetric Fano resonance lineshapes are obtained experimentally in the waveguide transmission spectrum with a maximum extinction ratio of 33 dB and a slope ratio of 10 dB/nm over a broadband flat background.

ABSTRACT: We report on the generation of passive harmonic mode locking of a fiber laser using a microfiber-based topological insulator (TI) Bi2Te3 saturable absorber (SA). The optical deposition method was employed to fabricate the microfiber-based TISA. By virtue of the excellent nonlinear optical property of the proposed TISA, the fiber laser could operate at the pulse repetition rate of 2.04 GHz under a pump power of 126 mW, corresponding to the 418th harmonic of fundamental repetition frequency. The results demonstrate that the microfiber-based TI photonic device can operate as both the high nonlinear optical component and the SA in fiber lasers, and could also find other applications in the related fields of photonics.

ABSTRACT: The aim of the paper is to create a topological model for the detection and recognition of hidden optical surveillance systems. The model is based on fractal insights about the structure of the optical signal and determination of the fractal dimension intensity distribution in a cross-sectional plane of the laser pulse reflected from the target. It is shown that the approximation of the fractal dimension value to unity is a prerequisite to the target classification as an optical surveillance device. In order to classify the type of an optical device along with the fractal dimension the group of the fractal characteristics, consisting of the type of fractal signatures, the type of spatial spectrum and the values of spatial frequency that characterize the signal structure must be developed.

ABSTRACT: The presence of p gauge flux enabled by positive and negative hopping amplitude can lead to Mobius bands, which was recently demonstrated in both realistic acoustic and photonic lattices, twisted at k = p. Here, we show that the artificial gauge flux configuration can be achieved by exploiting the interactions between photonic s and p orbital-like fundamental modes in circular and peanut-shaped waveguides, respectively. By manipulating the interplay between the gauge fields and the crystal symmetry, we show that breaking the primitive translation symmetry through lattice site dimerization and deformation can cause the original Dirac semimetal phase, characterized by a four-fold Dirac point at the Brillouin zone center, to transform into various topological phases. The designed photonic waveguide array supports topological phases such as Mobius insulator and Weyl-like semimetal phases. Noticeably different to the existing cases, we explicitly show that the twisting Mobius bands cross each other at k = 0 due to the lattice gauging with alternating sign, which results in distinct beam dynamics excitation. We also present Weyl-like flat-band edge states in such photonics waveguide arrays. Our results suggest that such s - p hybridized photonic waveguide array servers as a convenient and flexible platform for studying topological physics, particularly in simulating the effects of gauge field in alternative configuration.

ABSTRACT: The emergence of a fractal energy spectrum is the quintessence of the interplay between two periodic parameters with incommensurate length scales. crystals can emulate such interplay and also exhibit a topological bulk-boundary correspondence, enabled by their nontrivial topology in virtual dimensions. Here we propose, fabricate and experimentally test a reconfigurable one-dimensional (1D) acoustic array, in which the resonant frequencies of each element can be independently fine-tuned by a piston. We map experimentally the full Hofstadter butterfly spectrum by measuring the acoustic density of states distributed over frequency while varying the long-range order of the array. Furthermore, by adiabatically changing the phason of the array, we map topologically protected fractal boundary states, which are shown to be pumped from one edge to the other. This reconfigurable crystal serves as a model for future extensions to electronics, photonics and mechanics, as well as to quasicrystalline systems in higher dimensions.

ABSTRACT: "We show that weak measurements can be used to measure the tiny signature of topological phase transitions. The signature is an in-plane photonic spin Hall effect, which can be described as a consequence of a Berry phase. It is also parallel to the propagation direction of a light beam. The imaginary part of the weak value can be used to analyze ultrasmall longitudinal phase shifts in different topological phases. These optical signatures are related to the Chern number and bandgaps  we also use a preselection and postselection technique on the spin state to enhance the original signature. The weak amplification technique offers a potential way to determine the spin and valley properties of charge carriers, Chern numbers, and topological phases by direct optical measurement.

ABSTRACT: Optical complex materials offer unprecedented opportunity to engineer fundamental band dispersion, which enables novel optoelectronic functionality and devices. Exploration of the photonic Dirac cone at the center of momentum space has inspired an exceptional characteristic of zero index, which is similar to zero effective mass in Fermionic Dirac systems. Such all-dielectric zero-index photonic crystals provide an in-plane mechanism such that the energy of the propagating waves can be well confined along the chip direction. A straightforward example is to achieve the anomalous focusing effect without longitudinal spherical aberration when the size of the zero-index lens is large enough. Here, we designed and fabricated a prototype of a zero-refractive-index lens by using a large-area silicon nanopillar array with a plane-concave profile. The near-zero refractive index was quantitatively measured near 1550 nm through the anomalous focusing effect, predictable by effective medium theory. The zero-index lens was also demonstrated to have ultralow longitudinal spherical aberration. Such an integrated-circuit-compatible device provides a new route to integrate all-silicon zero-index materials into optical communication, sensing, and modulation and to study fundamental physics in the emergent fields of topological photonics and valley photonics.

ABSTRACT: Mechanically triturated n- and p-type Bi2Te3 nanoparticles, the nanoscale topological insulators (TIs), are employed as nonlinear saturable absorbers to passively mode-lock the erbium-doped fiber lasers (EDFLs) for sub-400 fs pulse generations. A novel method is proposed to enable the control on the self-amplitude modulation (SAM) of TI by adjusting its dopant type. The dopant type of TI only shifts the Fermi level without changing its energy bandgap, that the n- and p-type Bi2Te3 nanoparticles have shown the broadband saturable absorption at 800 and 1570 nm. In addition, both the complicated pulse shortening procedure and the competition between hybrid mode-locking mechanisms in the Bi2Te3 nanoparticle mode-locked EDFL system have been elucidated. The p-type Bi2Te3 with its lower effective Fermi level results in more capacity for excited carriers than the n-type Bi2Te3, which shortens the pulse width by enlarging the SAM depth. However, the strong self-phase modulation occurs with reduced linear loss and highly nonsaturated absorption, which dominates the pulse shortening mechanism in the passively mode-locked EDFL to deliver comparable pulse widths of 400 and 385 fs with n- and p-type Bi2Te3 nanoparticles, respectively. The first- and second-order Kelly sidebands under soliton mode-locking regime are also observed at offset frequencies of 1.31 and 1.94 THz, respectively.

ABSTRACT: As a novel branch of topology, non-Hermitian topological systems have been extensively studied in theory and experiments recently. Topological parity-time (PT)-symmetric semiconductor stripe laser arrays based on the Su-Schreiffer-Heeger model are proposed. The degree of non-Hermicity can be tuned by altering the length of the cavities, and PT symmetry can be realized by patterned electrode. Three laser arrays working in different non-Hermitian phases are analyzed and fabricated. With the increasing degree of non-Hermicity, the peaks of output intensities move from the edge to the bulk. The proposed semiconductor stripe laser array can function as an active, flexible, and feasible platform to investigate and explore non-Hermitian topology for further developments in this field.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonic systems have been explored extensively due to the robust electromagnetic states they support. In this work, we propose a finite-difference supercell approach to analyze the topological property of photonic crystal (PC) structures. Meanwhile, the pseudospin polarized edge states at the interface of two PC structures with different topologies are studied. The direction of the energy flow is found to be determined by the helicity of the pseudospin polarization.

ABSTRACT: Optical skyrmions, quasiparticles that are characterized by the topologically nontrivial vectorial textures of optical parameters such as the electromagnetic field, Stokes parameters, and spin angular momentum, have aroused great attention recently. New dimensions for optical information processing, transfer, and storage have become possible, and developing multiple schemes for manipulating the topological states of skyrmions, thus, is urgent. Here we propose an approach toward achieving dynamic modulation of skyrmions via changing the field symmetry and adding chirality. We demonstrate that field symmetry governs the skyrmionic transformation between skyrmions and merons, whereas material chirality modulates the twist degree of fields and spins and takes control of the Neel-type-Bloch-type skyrmionic transition. Remarkably, the enantioselective twist of skyrmions and merons results from the longitudinal spin arising from the chirality-induced splitting of the hyperboloid in the momentum space. Our investigation, therefore, acts to enrich the portfolio of optical quasiparticles. The chiral route to topological state transitions will deepen our understanding of light-matter interaction and pave the way for chiral sensing, optical tweezers, and topological phase transitions in quantum matter.

ABSTRACT: Ultrafast carrier dynamics in the topological insulator Bi2Se3 have recently been intensively studied using a variety of techniques. However, we are not aware of any successful experiments exploiting transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy for these purposes. Here we demonstrate that if the similar to 730 nm wavelength pumping (similar to 1.7 eV photon energy) is applied to ultrathin Bi2Se3 films, TA spectra cover the entire visible region, thus unambiguously pointing to two-photon excitation (similar to 3.4 eV). The carrier relaxation dynamics is found to be governed by the polar optical phonon cascade emission occurring in both the bulk states and the Dirac surface states (SS), including SS-bulk-SS vertical electron transport and being also exclusively influenced by whether the Dirac point is presented between the Dirac cones of the higher energy (similar to 1.5 eV) Dirac SS (known as SS2). We have recognized that SS2 act as a valve substantially slowing down the relaxation of electrons when the gap between Dirac cones exceeds the polar optical phonon and resonant defect energies. The resulting progressive accumulation of electrons in the gapped SS2 becomes detectable through the inverse-bremsstrahlung-type free carrier absorption.

ABSTRACT: We report the appearance of multiple numbers of completely flat band states in an extended Lieb lattice model in two dimensions with five atomic sites per unit cell. We also show that this edge-centered square lattice can host intriguing topologically nontrivial phases when intrinsic spin-orbit (ISO) coupling is introduced in the microscopic description of the corresponding tight-binding Hamiltonian of the system. This ISO coupling strength acts like a complex next-nearest-neighbor hopping term for this model and can be, in principle, tuned in a real-life experimental setup. In the presence of this ISO coupling, the band spectrum of the system gets gapped out, leading to nonzero integer values of the spin Chern number for different bands, indicating the nontrivial topological properties of the system. Furthermore, we show that for certain values of the ISO coupling, nearly flat bands with nonzero Chern numbers emerge in this lattice model. This opens up the possibility of realizing interesting fractional quantum spin Hall physics in this model when interaction is taken into account. This study might be very useful in an analogous optical lattice experimental setup. A possible application of our results can also be anticipated in the field of photonics using single-mode photonic waveguide networks.

ABSTRACT: As one of the most attractive non-radiative power transfer mechanisms without cables, efficient magnetic resonance wireless power transfer (WPT) in the near field has been extensively developed in recent years, and promoted a variety of practical applications, such as mobile phones, medical implant devices and electric vehicles. However, the physical mechanism behind some key limitations of the resonance WPT, such as frequency splitting and size-dependent efficiency, is not very clear under the widely used circuit model. Here, we review the recently developed efficient and stable resonance WPT based on non-Hermitian physics, which starts from a completely different avenue (utilizing loss and gain) to introduce novel functionalities to the resonance WPT. From the perspective of non-Hermitian photonics, the coherent and incoherent effects compete and coexist in the WPT system, and the weak stable of energy transfer mainly comes from the broken phase associated with the phase transition of parity-time symmetry. Based on this basic physical framework, some optimization schemes are proposed, including using nonlinear effect, using bound states in the continuum, or resorting to the system with high-order parity-time symmetry. Moreover, the combination of non-Hermitian physics and topological photonics in multi-coil system also provides a versatile platform for long-range robust WPT with topological protection. Therefore, the non-Hermitian physics can not only exactly predict the main results of current WPT systems, but also provide new ways to solve the difficulties of previous designs.

ABSTRACT: Researches on the topological edge state in the photonic lattice are attracting considerable attention. Here, we report the studies on a particular state for which the topological invariant is undefined. We constructed an anti-parity-time-symmetric photonic lattice by using the perturbation method. Light distributes only in the wide waveguides with equal magnitude for the state with undefined winding numbers. Further studies show that the equal intensity transmission is unaffected except for the defect site. Our work provides a new way to study the topological state and the equally divided light transmission and might be applicable in optical circuits and optical interconnect.

ABSTRACT: The special properties of non-trivial topological structures usually come from a so-called edge mode which emerges in the band gap after the band inversion. The topological winding number of exceptional points (EPs) in non-Hermitian physical systems can be regarded as another type of topology. In photonics, the topological properties of EPs have been observed widely both in adiabatic and non-adiabatic second-order non-Hermitian systems. Here, we construct a higher-order non-Hermitian system with meta-atoms, including two independent second-order EPs. By circling EPs in different paths in the Riemann parameter surface, we observe extraordinary modes of reversion and repulsion, which is quite different from the conventional second-order EP systems. We propose a theoretical model of three-resonance non-Hermitian system and verify experimentally the mode reversion by encircling exceptional points in the microwave band, which may pave a new way for studying the topological physical mechanism of non-Hermitian systems, and provide a practical experimental system for its application.

ABSTRACT: Control of the electromagneticwaves in nano-scale structured materials is crucial to the development of next generation photonic circuits and devices. In this context, hyperbolic metamaterials, where elliptical isofrequency surfaces are morphed into surfaces with exotic hyperbolic topologies when the structure parameters are tuned, have shown unprecedented control over light propagation and interaction. Here we show that such topological transitions can be even more unusual when the hyperbolic metamaterial is endowed with nonreciprocity. Judicious design of metamaterials with reduced spatial symmetries, together with the breaking of time-reversal symmetry through magnetization, is shownto result in nonreciprocal dispersion and one-way topological phase transitions in hyperbolic metamaterials.

ABSTRACT: The objective of this paper is to review the characterisation methods and procedures used to laser switch phase change materials, and then assess their applicability for characterising phase change materials for active photonics devices. Specifically we characterise the performance of our pump-probe laser system and compare it with other 'static' and 'dynamic' testers. Our pump-probe system was developed to measure the phase transformation kinetics of chalcogenide films by simultaneously measuring the transmission and reflection of a probe laser with a temporal resolution of 1 ns. We also use the system to measure the second order nonlinear refractive index of chalcogenide thin films. Laser switching of chalcogenides are efficient methods to screen new materials but the switching time seems to have a strong dependence on the measurement method and procedure. Therefore in this article we recommend bespoke methods and procedures for assessing the performance of new chalcogenide compositions for specific photonic devices.

ABSTRACT: Complex aperiodic 1D dielectric distributions offer intriguing optical propagation features. For example, Thue-Morse (TM) sequence-based 1D photonic crystals (PCs) exhibit transmission spectra that are characterized by fractal band structure, i.e. they comprise traditional photonic band gaps (TPBGs) and fractal PBGs along with non-intuitive local resonances. These arise out ofnot-so-apparentpositional correlations in the dielectric distribution. We identify inter-cell and intra-cell interaction betweenhiddendimer-like units in a TM-PC and present a relationship between the topological phase of lowest-order pass bands with reflection phase () in the TPBGs. The analysis reveals that the dielectric filling factor (sigma) of a TM-PC could serve as a parameter that determines the topological invariants for the geometry and could be tuned optimally in TM-PC-based heterostructures for exciting optical edge modes, which are disorder resistant (ortopologically protected). We also discuss the robustness of optical edge modes.

ABSTRACT: Nodal line semimetals exhibiting line degeneracies in three-dimensional momentum space have been demonstrated recently. In general, the presence of nodal line semimetals is protected by special symmetries, such as mirror symmetry. However, these symmetries are usually necessary but not sufficient conditions, as nodal lines can be annihilated even without breaking them. Very recently, nodal line semimetal possessing an hourglass-shaped band structure emerges as a more robust candidate, where line degeneracies cannot be annihilated while preserving all underlying spatial symmetries. Here, for the first time, we experimentally demonstrate the presence of an hourglass nodal line (HNL) in photonic metacrystal at microwave frequency. We observe the HNL through near-field scanning of the spatial fields, followed by subsequent Fourier transformations. The observed photonic HNL resides in a clean and large frequency interval and is immune to symmetry preserving perturbation, which provides an ideal robust platform for photonic applications, such as anomalous quantum oscillation, spontaneous emission and resonant scattering.

ABSTRACT: Non-Hermiticity extends the topological phase beyond the given Hermitian structure. Whereas the phases of non-Hermitian topological systems derived from Hermitian components have been extensively explored, the topological properties of an acoustic crystal that occur purely due to non-Hermiticity require further investigation. In this letter, we describe the development of an acoustic crystal with an adjustable loss that is composed of a chain of one-dimensional, coupled acoustic resonators. Each unit cell can contain three or six resonators, which are equivalent to 3 x 3 or 6 x 6 non-Hermitian Hamiltonian matrices, respectively. The topological properties of the crystal were verified by calculating the defined topological invariant, and the states of the edge and interface of the acoustic crystal were obtained by using a practical model. We obtained the states of the edges and the interface for both odd and even numbers of resonators in each unit cell and found that the location of the inductive loss had an important effect on the topological properties. This results here can guide research on advanced wave control for sensing and communication applications.

ABSTRACT: Topological crystalline insulators are a class of materials with a bulk energy gap and edge or surface modes, which are protected by crystalline symmetry, at their boundaries. They have been realized in electronic systems: in particular, in SnTe. In this work, we propose a mechanism to realize photonic boundary states topologically protected by crystalline symmetry. We map this one-dimensional system to a two-dimensional lattice model with opposite magnetic fields, as well as opposite Chern numbers in its even and odd mirror parity subspaces, thus corresponding to a topological mirror insulator. Furthermore, we test the robustness of the boundary modes depending on their mirror parity by performing time dependent evolution simulations in a photonic setting with realistic experimental parameters.

ABSTRACT: Resolving spatial and temporal complexities in wave-matter interactions is essential for controlling the light behavior inside disordered and nonstationary systems and therefore achieving high capacity devices. Although these complexities have usually been studied separately, a few examples exploiting both degrees of freedom have derived intriguing phenomena such as hyper-transport in evolving disorder and topological phenomena in synthetic dimensions. Here, engineering active disorder-disordered structures with external modulation-is proposed by employing deep neural networks. A functional regressor and a material evaluator are developed to enable inverse design of active disorder with target wave responses and evaluation of disordered structures according to the wave response controllability, respectively. By machine engineering deep-subwavelength disorder including a phase change material, functional disorder for light is revealed, which leads to angle-selective or broadband digital switching. A generative configuration of the neural network utilizing a single wave metric is also developed to realize a family of disordered structures with independent engineering of multiple wave properties, in contrast to the traditional engineering of disorder with a specific order metric. This approach establishes realization of reconfigurable devices by exploiting the spatiotemporal complexity in wave mechanics.

ABSTRACT: We study photonic signatures of symmetry broken and topological phases in a driven, dissipative circuit QED realization of spin-1/2 chains. Specifically, we consider the transverse-field XY model and a dual model with three-spin interactions. The former has a ferromagnetic and a paramagnetic phase, while the latter features, in addition, a symmetry protected topological phase. Using the method of third quantization, we calculate the nonequilibrium steady state of the open spin chains for arbitrary system sizes and temperatures. We find that the bilocal correlation function of the spins at both ends of the chain provides a sensitive measure for both symmetry-breaking and topological phase transitions of the systems, but no universal means to distinguish between the two types of transitions. Both models have equivalent representations in terms of free Majorana fermions, which host zero, one and two topological Majorana end modes in the paramagnetic, ferromagnetic, and symmetry protected topological phases, respectively. The correlation function we study retains its bilocal character in the fermionic representation, so that our results are equally applicable to the fermionic models in their own right. We propose a photonic realization of the dissipative transverse-field XY model in a tunable setup, where an array of superconducting transmon qubits is coupled at both ends to a photonic microwave circuit.

ABSTRACT: A solid-state laser that generates 10 x 10 vortex laser arrays is demonstrated. The topologies are actively tunable. Geometric arrays of vortices found in various systems owe their regular structure to mutual interactions within a confined system. In optics, such vortex crystals may form spontaneously within a resonator. Their crystallization is relevant in many areas of physics, although their usefulness is limited by the lack of control over their topology. On the other hand, programmable devices like spatial light modulators allow the design of nearly arbitrary vortex distributions but without any intrinsic evolution. By combining non-Hermitian optics with on-demand topological transformations enabled by metasurfaces, we report a solid-state laser that generates 10 x 10 vortex laser arrays with actively tunable topologies and non-local coupling dictated by the array's topology. The vortex arrays exhibit sharp Bragg diffraction peaks, witnessing their coherence and topological charge purity, which we spatially resolve over the whole lattice by introducing a parallelized analysis technique. By structuring light at the source, we enable complex transformations that allow to arbitrarily partition orbital angular momentum within the cavity and to heal topological charge defects, thus realizing robust and versatile resonators for applications in topological optics.

ABSTRACT: Topological materials rely on engineering global properties of their bulk energy bands called topological invariants. These invariants, usually defined over the entire Brillouin zone, are related to the existence of protected edge states. However, for an important class of Hamiltonians corresponding to 2D lattices with time-reversal and chiral symmetry (e.g., graphene), the existence of edge states is linked to invariants that are not defined over the full 2D Brillouin zone, but on reduced 1D subspaces. Here, we demonstrate a novel scheme based on a combined real- and momentum-space measurement to directly access these 1D topological invariants in lattices of semiconductor microcavities confining exciton polaritons. We extract these invariants in arrays emulating the physics of regular and critically compressed graphene where Dirac cones have merged. Our scheme provides a direct evidence of the bulk-edge correspondence in these systems and opens the door to the exploration of more complex topological effects, e.g., involving disorder and interactions.

ABSTRACT: We report that the photovoltaic effect can be produced in metals, semimetals, and semiconductor 3D topological insulators with crystalline and nanostructured states. The behavior of charge carriers in topological insulator crystals and metal foils was investigated under laser illumination. We developed a method for the measurement of electrical potential difference on surfaces of three-dimensional topological insulators: Bi and Sb single crystals, Bi foils, and (Bi1-xSbx)(2)Te-3 and (Bi1-xSex)(2)Te-3 nanostructured crystals, as well as metal foils of Al and Ni alloys. The surface voltage depends on the properties of samples obtained by different methods. The value of the surface potential difference depends on the laser illumination of the top or bottom surfaces of the samples. A negative surface potential difference was observed in most samples, except for Al foils and Ni alloy foils, with top surface illumination. Laser illumination of the bottom surface caused a larger surface potential difference in topological insulators, with the opposite polarity. Surface structure defects and specific band structures in the topological insulators studied provided an increase in the electrical potential difference on their surface due to the photovoltaic effect. The reduction of deposited laser energy from the bottom surface to the top surface by a factor of 1000 due to the low thermal conductivity of topological insulators increased the electrical potential difference by factors of 1.8-3.8. These results promise a new possibility for prospective research and development of energy-efficient photonic devices.

ABSTRACT: This paper provides a numerical analysis of the topological valley kink states along both zigzag and armchair domain walls of a dielectric two-dimensional photonic crystal (PC), considering the photonic energy band folding mechanism. By engineering the side length of triangular holes in a honeycomb PC, we created inequivalent valleys in the momentum space. We utilized two adjacent valley PCs with inverted structures to induce a topological transition of the TE mode energy band as it crossed the interface. Further research into the projected energy bands along both zigzag and armchair directions revealed that topologically protected valley kink states can be supported by both configurations. The zigzag interface enabled valley waveguides to transport chiral optical fields at the 0 degrees, 60 degrees, and 120 degrees bending angles, while maintaining their backscattering immune properties. The armchair interface, on the other hand, supported the straight propagation. By combining both armchair and zigzag interfaces, the valley waveguide can facilitate bending propagation at 90 degrees and 180 degrees, while also enabling the equal splitting of chiral fields at the intersection between these two interfaces. Our analyzation can be helpful to improve the applications of valley waveguides in integrated photonics.

ABSTRACT: Using the Richards-Wolf diffraction integral, the longitudinal energy evolution on the focal plane of the fractional order vector vortex (FOVV) beams was studied. These beams possessed a vortex topological charge n and a polarization topological charge m, and were subjected to tight focusing through a larger numerical aperture. Our investigation revealed the existence of backflow energy when the binary topological charges n and m satisfied the conditions of n + m = 2 or n - m = -2. The component circularly polarized vortex beams of e(-i2 phi)e(<^>)+ (i.e., the minus second-order vortex right circularly polarized beam) and e(i2 phi)e(<^>)- (i.e., the second-order vortex left circularly polarized beam) played significant roles in the generation of reverse energy flux at the focal region. For FOVV beams with binary topological charges n and m, whose sum and difference were integers, the longitudinal energy on the focal plane exhibited axial symmetry. If the sum or the difference of the topological charges n and m was not an integer, the axisymmetric longitudinal energy on the focal plane was disrupted.

ABSTRACT: It is known that the astigmatic transformation can be used to analyze the topological charge of a vortex beam, which can be implemented by using various optical methods. In this case, in order to form an astigmatic beam pattern suitable for the clear detection of a topological charge, an optical adjustment is often required (changing the lens tilt and/or the detection distance). In this article, we propose to use multi-channel diffractive optical elements (DOEs) for the simultaneous implementation of the astigmatic transformations of various types and levels. Such multi-channel DOEs make it possible to insert several types of astigmatic aberrations of different levels into the analyzed vortex beam simultaneously, and to form a set of aberration-transformed beam patterns in different diffraction orders in one detection plane. The proposed approach greatly simplifies the analysis of the characteristics of a vortex beam based on measurements in the single plane without additional adjustments. In this article, a detailed study of the effect of various types of astigmatic aberrations based on a numerical simulation and experiments was carried out, which confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

ABSTRACT: Recently, high-order topological photonic crystals (PhCs) have attracted huge research attention due to their novel physics mechanism and the application potential in integrated photonics. Based on the two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, we construct and study the mutual coupling between the high-order corner states in 2D dielectric PhCs. Simulation results show that the Q-factor of such corner-localized quasi-bound states in the continuum (BICs) could be enhanced tbllowing mutual coupling in finite size. Furthermore, we study the side-coupled structure based on defect-hybrid waveguides and the edge state microring, the quasi-BIC microcavity. The refractive index sensing application based on corner-localized quasi-BICs shows outstanding simulated sensitivity (312.8 nm/RIU) and figure of merit (similar to 10(3) 1/RIU). The robustness against fabrication errors due to its topologically protected nature makes it competitive compared with other quasi-BICs sensors.

ABSTRACT: Functional physical properties of laser-induced nanocluster structures of different topology in the thin films deposited on solid surface and 3D-crystallic structures by femto-nanoexperiments are studied. Physical basis and specific topology nanocluster view are under our consideration with regard to the functional properties variation (electrophysics + optics) in granular structures. Modeling of electronic energy levels modification due to the topology factors and nonlinear dynamic model for coupled electronic states in the cluster system are carried out. New physical principles for possible application of such structures of topological photonics with different element compositions are discussed.

ABSTRACT: The photonic analogy of the quantum spin Hall Effect, that is, a photonic topological insulator (PTI), is of great relevance to science and technology in optics based on the promise of scattering-free surface states. The challenges in realizing such scattering-free surface states in PTIs and other types of symmetry-protected topological phases are the result of the exact symmetry needed for creating a pair of time reversal pseudo-spin states or special boundary conditions, wherein the exact symmetry imposes strict requirements on materials or boundary conditions. Here, it is experimentally demonstrated that scattering-free edge states can be created with neither the aforementioned exact symmetry requirements for materials nor the topological transitions. This system is constructed by simply placing together regular homogeneous metamaterials, which are characterized by highly different bianisotropies. Of the particular surface states, backward reflection would be deeply suppressed, provided that the related evanescent tail into the bulk regions vanishes shortly and that the pseudo-spin is not flipped by the scatterers. This work gives an example of constructing scattering-free surface states in classical systems without strict symmetry protections and may potentially stimulate various novel applications in the future.

ABSTRACT: We report new oscillations of wave packets in quantum walks subjected to electric fields, that decorate the usual Bloch-Zener oscillations of insulators. The number of turning points (or suboscillations) within one Bloch period of these oscillations is found to be governed by the winding of the quasienergy spectrum. Thus, this provides a new physical manifestation of a topological property of periodically driven systems that can be probed experimentally. Our model, based on an oriented scattering network, is readily implementable in photonic and cold atomic setups.

ABSTRACT: Fiber-to-chip couplers are critical devices to support interconnections between fibers and photonic integrated circuits. The advent of spatial division multiplexing (SDM) systems based on multicore fibers makes these devices subject to increasingly demanding footprint and coupling requirements. In addition to size and efficiency requirements, the manufacturing constraints and large parameter space result in a challenging optimization problem. This article applies topology optimization to design three integrated couplers for multicore fibers with an intercore spacing of 32 mu m. By individually optimizing the radiating and tapering regions, we design and experimentally demonstrate two devices: the first with perpendicular coupling and an efficiency of -3.8 dB, with a footprint of 15 mu m x 10 mu m, and the second with a 10 degrees coupling angle and an efficiency of -2.9 dB, with a footprint of 20 mu m x 10 mu m. Furthermore, by applying topology optimization over the whole design region, we improved the simulated efficiency to -1.9 dB within a footprint of only 10 mu m x 10 mu m, which represent the most compact CMOS-compatible coupler to date with efficiency among the highest in class. These are the first devices that can enable direct coupling between silicon chips and multicore fibers with intercore separation below 25 mu m.

ABSTRACT: "A kind of diffractive optical elements (DOE) with star-ring topological structure is proposed and their focusing and imaging properties are studied in detail. The so-called star-ring topological structure denotes that a large number of pinholes distributed in many specific zone orbits. In two dimensional plane, this structure can be constructed by two constrains, one is a mapping function, which yields total potential zone orbits, corresponding to the optical path difference (OPD)  the other is a switching sequence based on the given encoded seed elements and recursion relation to operate the valid zone orbits. The focusing and imaging properties of DOE with star-ring topological structure are only determined by the aperiodic sequence, and not relevant to the concrete geometry structure. In this way, we can not only complete the traditional symmetrical DOE, such as circular Dammam grating, Fresnel zone plates, photon sieves, and their derivatives, but also construct asymmetrical elements with anisotropic diffraction pattern. Similarly, free-form surface or three dimensional DOE with star-ring topological structure can be constructed by the same method proposed. In consequence of smaller size, lighter weight, more flexible design, these elements may allow for some new applications in micro and nanphotonics."

ABSTRACT: Higher-order topological (HOT) insulators have been extensively studied for their unique multidimensional boundary states such as hinge states and corner states. However, most of the recent studies are limited to static excitation of topological boundary states, restricting the development of their practical devices that possess the capability of diverse and programmable dynamic control of states. Here, a facile approach to achieve flexible control of light-steering based on the symmetrized wave profiles of topological corner states is introduced. Specifically, multiple coherent sources are imported at symmetrical positions in higher-order topological photonic crystals. By engineering phase differences among the sources, a controllable spatial-resolved excitation of topological corner states is realized and a coding technique via controllable excitation of topological corner states is raised conceptually. Furthermore, an effective way to achieve direction-selective excitation of topological edge states without the requirement of circularly polarized sources is proposed. The result provides a reliable active technique to modulate HOT boundary states while keeping the photonic structure invariable, which might be a practical alternative to manipulate light flexibly in integrated topological photonic devices with fixed configuration.

ABSTRACT: Vortex modes carrying Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) provide an ideal platform for realizing many novel physical effects and applications ranging from classical to quantum regimes. An important approach to generating the vortex modes is the electromagnetic (EM) scattering by scatterers holding high degrees of symmetries. Within this context, a clear link is established between the symmetries and the topological charges of the vortex modes. A symmetry matching condition is formulated and a design rule consisting of two simple formulas is suggested to excite a specific topological charge order. The formulas are numerically and experimentally verified by designing a microwave resonator and its feeding network to generate vortex modes with topological charges from l=+/- 1$l = \pm 1$ to l=+/- 4$l = \pm 4$. The reported approach can be applied to microwave, terahertz, and optical applications, and hence provides a holistic design principle for engineering vortex modes for a wide EM spectrum.

ABSTRACT: Complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology has provided a highly sensitive detection platform for high-resolution optical imaging, sensing and metrology. Although the detection of optical beams carrying angular momentum have been explored with nanophotonic methods, the metrology of optical angular momentum has been limited to bulk optics. We demonstrate angular-momentum nanometrology through the spatial displacement engineering of plasmonic angular momentum modes in a CMOS-compatible plasmonic topological insulator material. The generation and propagation of surface plasmon polaritons on the surface of an ultrathin topological insulator Sb2Te3 film with a thickness of 100 nm is confirmed, exhibiting plasmonic figures of merit superior to noble metal plasmonics in the ultraviolet-visible frequency range. Angular-momentum nanometrology with a low crosstalk of less than -20 dB is achieved. This compact high-precision angular-momentum nanometrology opens an unprecedented opportunity for on-chip manipulation of optical angular momentum for high-capacity information processing, ultrasensitive molecular sensing, and ultracompact multi-functional optoelectronic devices.

ABSTRACT: We demonstrate dynamically switching the topological charge of surface plasmon (SP) vortex in gold metasurfaces by altering the polarization states of incident light. Two SP vortex sources with different helicity are created by the optimized L-shaped and '+'-shaped nanoslits with right-handed circular polarized and linear polarized excitations, respectively. By elaborately arraying the nanoslits to form a circle, the topological charge of the created SP vortex can be switched from -1 to 1 via altering the polarization states of incident light from circular to linear. Moreover, based on such a strategy, the topological charge can be switched from 0 to 2 by elaborately arraying the nanoslits to form an Archimedes spiral. These results provide the extra degree of freedom to modulate the topological charge of SP vortex, promising practical applications in optical communication, particle trapping, and integrated photonic circuits.

ABSTRACT: Recent developments of high harmonic generation (HHG) have enabled the production of structured extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) ultrafast laser beams with orbital angular momentum (OAM). Precise manipulation and characterization of their spatial structure are paramount for their application in state-of-the-art ultrafast studies. In this work, we report the generation and characterization of EUV vortex beams bearing a topological charge as high as 100. Thanks to OAM conservation, HHG in noble gases offers a unique opportunity to generate ultrafast harmonic beams with a high topological charge from low charge infrared vortex beams. A high-resolution Hartmann wavefront sensor allows us to perform a complete spatial characterization of the amplitude and phase of the 25th harmonic beam (32.6 nm), revealing very high-topological charges in the EUV spectral regime. Our experimental results, supported h numerical HHG simulations, demonstrate the linear upscaling of the OAM of the high-orth harmonics with that of low-charge driving vortex beams, showing the sensitiveness of the OAM content to the purity of the driving beam. The generation of structured EUV beams carrying large topological charges brings in the promising scenario of OAM transfer from light to matter at both macroscopic and microscopic scales.

ABSTRACT: The authors combine films of two-dimensional semiconductors, which exhibit excitonic spectral features, with SiO2/Si Fabry-Perot resonators in order to realize topological phase singularities in reflection. Around these singularities, the reflection spectra demonstrate rapid phase changes while the structure behaves as a perfect absorber. Atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) present a promising platform for numerous photonic applications due to excitonic spectral features, possibility to tune their constants by external gating, doping, or light, and mechanical stability. Utilization of such materials for sensing or optical modulation purposes would require a clever optical design, as by itself the 2D materials can offer only a small optical phase delay - consequence of the atomic thickness. To address this issue, we combine films of 2D semiconductors which exhibit excitonic lines with the Fabry-Perot resonators of the standard commercial SiO2/Si substrate, in order to realize topological phase singularities in reflection. Around these singularities, reflection spectra demonstrate rapid phase changes while the structure behaves as a perfect absorber. Furthermore, we demonstrate that such topological phase singularities are ubiquitous for the entire class of atomically thin TMDCs and other high-refractive-index materials, making it a powerful tool for phase engineering in flat optics. As a practical demonstration, we employ PdSe2 topological phase singularities for a refractive index sensor and demonstrate its superior phase sensitivity compared to typical surface plasmon resonance sensors.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics is becoming increasingly important due to its possibility to manipulate light with topological phases. Constrained by tunable material, the concept of the topological phase of light is less employed for the realization of terahertz (THz) devices. Incorporating tunable plasmonic materials with topological photonic structures can promote topological protection at the THz frequency. Here the topological phase transition in the terahertz bands is demonstrated by integrating Dirac semi-metal with topological photonic crystal. This work proposes photonic band inversion induced frequency splitting and absorption enhancement in bulk Dirac semi-metal (BDS) based Tamm plasmon multilayer system. The enhancement in absorption is achieved by designing a one-dimensional topological edge state such that the combination with the Tamm plasmon state provides topological protection to the entire BDS-photonic crystal heterostructure. The proposed structure undergoes band inversion, a topological transition in the photonic band structure. These results may facilitate the realization of terahertz topological effects and contribute to the goal of topological protection in sensing applications.

ABSTRACT: With the rapid development of two-dimensional semiconductor technology, the inevitable chemical disorder at a typical metal-semiconductor interface has become an increasingly serious problem that degrades the performance of 2D semiconductor optoelectronic devices. Herein, defect-free van der Waals contacts have been achieved by utilizing topological Bi2Se3 as the electrodes. Such clean and atomically sharp contacts avoid the consumption of photogenerated carriers at the interface, enabling a markedly boosted sensitivity as compared to counterpart devices with directly deposited metal electrodes. Typically, the device with 2D WSe2 channel realizes a high responsivity of 20.5 A W-1, an excellent detectivity of 2.18 x 10(12) Jones, and a fast rise/decay time of 41.66/38.81 ms. Furthermore, high-resolution visible-light imaging capability of the WSe2 device is demonstrated, indicating its promising application prospect in future optoelectronic systems. More inspiringly, the topological electrodes are universally applicable to other 2D semiconductor channels, including WS2 and InSe, suggesting its broad applicability. These results open fascinating opportunities for the development of high-performance electronics and optoelectronics.

ABSTRACT: Quantum materials with massless Dirac fermions -- such as graphene and topological insulators -- exhibit extremely large terahertz nonlinearities. This is the result of their ultrafast thermodynamics: efficient electron heating-cooling dynamics taking place on femtosecond-picosecond timescales. We have recently developed a grating-graphene metamaterial with local field enhancement, giving rise to strongly enhanced THz nonlinearities in graphene. These grating-graphene metamaterials, however, suffer from saturation effects due to inefficient electronic heat dissipation, and therefore produce limited harmonic output power. Most recently, we have used a topological insulator system with surprisingly efficient surface-to-bulk electronic heat dissipation, which strongly reduces saturation effects. As a result, we demonstrated close to a milliwatt of generated third harmonic signal from a fundamental signal at 500 GHz. These results have interesting prospects for nonlinear terahertz photonic applications.

ABSTRACT: We reported on the synthesis of high quality bulk selenium (Se)-doped black phosphorus (BP) crystals using a mineralizer assisted gas-phase transformation in a mild growth condition and employed a liquid phase exfoliation approach to obtain few-layer (FL) Se-doped BP nano-sheets from the bulk counterpart. We experimentally found that FL Se-doped BP shows enhanced optical saturable absorption with long term stability, which may originate from selenium doping-induced changes of intrinsic carrier density. Taking advantage of its nonlinear optical property, we designed an optical saturable absorber (SA) device based on FL Se-doped BP, allowing the generation of a femto-second pulse in the fiber laser. Our results not only provide a new strategy in tailoring the nonlinear optical response of BP through element doping, but also suggest that FL Se-doped BP can be developed as a excellent candidate for ultrafast photonics.

ABSTRACT: The optical modes of photonic structures are the so-called TE and TM modes that bring intrinsic spin-orbit coupling and chirality to these systems. This, combined with the unique flexibility of design of the photonic potential, and the possibility to mix photon states with excitonic resonances, sensitive to magnetic field and interactions, allows us to achieve many phenomena, often analogous to other solid-state systems. In this contribution, we review in a qualitative and comprehensive way several of these realizations, namely the optical spin Hall effect, the creation of spin currents protected by a non-trivial geometry, the Berry curvature for photons, and the photonic/polaritonic topological insulator.

ABSTRACT: Low-dimensional (LD) materials have originated a range of innovative applications in photonics and optoelectronics owning to their advantages of ultrafast carrier response and distinct nonlinear saturable absorption properties. In particular, these emerging LD materials including zero-, one-, and two-dimensional materials have recently been utilized for short and ultrashort pulse laser generation in the visible, near infrared, and mid-infrared wavelength regions. Here, we review recent progress demonstrating the application of LD materials as versatile, wideband saturable absorbers for Q-switching and mode-locking in all-solid-state lasers. The laser performance in operating wavelength, output power, pulse width, repetition rate, and pulse energy is reviewed. Finally, the challenges and future perspectives are suggested.

ABSTRACT: Entanglement is one of the most essential resources for quantum information. In addition to increasing the scale of entanglement, improving its flexibility is also of vital importance for its practical applications. In this article, a continuous-variable (CV) entanglement of six orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes whose topological charges can be flexibly reconfigured is experimentally generated. In particular, six sets of CV hexapartite entanglement of OAM modes are obtained with their topological charges reconfigurable. The scheme enables the redistribution of the entangled OAM modes among the quantum channels, which provides a flexible platform to construct reconfigurable quantum communication networks in the CV regime.

ABSTRACT: The investigation of van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures has been becoming an attractive research topic due to their unique electrical, optical and magnetic properties. The vdW heterostructures are generally constructed from stacks of atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) materials and their performance is closely dependent on the constituent 2D materials and the physical interactions between these layers. Importantly, a lot of interesting progress of vdW heterostructures in the electrical, optical and magnetic properties has been achieved recently, which lays a solid foundation for the fundamental research of this field and their future applications. In this review, a series of preparation methods of vdW heterostructures are introduced and the research on ultrafast exciton dynamics in vdW heterostructures is summarized and discussed. Furthermore, the nonlinear optical properties of vdW heterostructures and their applications in ultrafast lasers are also reviewed together with the challenges and future opportunities in this research field. This review aims to present a thorough summarization of the research progress of vdW heterostructures in ultrafast photonics, in order to promote the development in this field.

ABSTRACT: Graphene is a unique 2D material that has been extensively investigated due to its extraordinary photonic, electronic, thermal, and mechanical properties. Excited plasmons along its surface and other unique features are expected to play an important role in many emerging photonic technologies with drastically improved and tunable functionalities. This review is focused on presenting several recently introduced photonic phenomena based on graphene, beyond its usual linear response, such as nonlinear, active, topological, and nonreciprocal effects. The physical mechanisms and various envisioned photonic applications corresponding to these novel intriguing functionalities are also reported. The presented graphene-based technologies promise to revolutionize the field of photonics at the relatively unexplored terahertz (THz) frequency range. They are envisioned to lead to the design of compact harmonic generators, low-power wave mixers, linear and nonlinear sensors, magnet-free isolators and circulators, photonic topological insulators, modulators, compact coherent optical radiation sources, and subwavelength imaging devices.

ABSTRACT: Light beams with helical wave fronts, also called optical vortices, have attracted great interest in the community of optics and photonics. They provide an additional degree of freedom for light manipulation, leading to wide-ranging potential applications in micro-particle trapping, optical microscopy, and even quantum information processing. Recently, metallic microstructures are introduced to confine the plasmonic vortices into deep subwavelength dimension, which benefits photonic integration on chip. In this Letter, exploiting the excitation of spoof surface plasmon, we experimentally demonstrate the near-field optical vortices with tunable topological charges supported by a single metaparticle in the microwave regime. These microwave plasmonic-like vortices are excited by surface waves with a spatial asymmetric distribution of electromagnetic field, which are launched by a metallic comb-shaped waveguide. Experimental characterization of highly localized and controllable near-field vortices with the nature of deep subwavelength confirms the numerical simulation. In addition, an equivalent physical model based on the coupled mode theory is proposed to understand the generation mechanism of these spoof plasmonic vortices. Our approach offers an efficient way to generate deterministic subwavelength optical vortices, which provides the potential for critical vortex elements on photonic integrated chip.

ABSTRACT: As the field of topological photonics has developed over the past 10 years, it has been proven that the combination of topology and photons is very beneficial to the design of robust optical devices against some disturbances. However, most of the work on robust optical logic devices stays at the theoretical level. There are very few topologically-protected logic devices fabricated in experiments. Here, the experimental fabrication of a series of topologically-protected all-optical logic gates is reported. Seven topologically-protected all-optical logic gates (OR, XOR, NOT, XNOR, NAND, NOR, and AND) are fabricated on silicon photonic platforms, which show strong robustness even if some disorders exist. These robust logic devices are potentially applicable in future optical signal processing and computing applications.

In the experimental measurement setup we use standard microwave equipment only. The electromagnetic characteristics of metamaterials can be adjusted by selecting dielectric particles with different geometrical parameters. We show a direct appearance of a particular (toroidal) mode excited in an all-dielectric metamaterial with a complex topology. The introduced routine from the sample fabrication to result analysis allows studying topological features of all-dielectric metamaterials in detail.

ABSTRACT: We investigate topologically-protected unidirectional leaky waves on magnetized plasmonic structures acting as homogeneous photonic topological insulators. Our theoretical analyses and numerical experiments aim at unveiling the general properties of these exotic surface waves, and their nonreciprocal and topological nature. In particular, we study the behavior of topological leaky modes in stratified structures composed of a magnetized plasma at the interface with isotropic conventional media, and we show how to engineer their propagation and radiation properties, leading to topologically-protected backscattering-immune wave propagation, and highly directive and tunable radiation. Taking advantage of the non-trivial topological properties of these leaky modes, we also theoretically demonstrate advanced functionalities, including arbitrary re-routing of leaky waves on the surface of bodies with complex shapes, as well as the realization of topological leaky-wave (nano) antennas with isolated channels of radiation that are completely independent and separately tunable. Our findings help shedding light on the behavior of topologically-protected modes in open wave-guiding structures, and may open intriguing directions for future antenna generations based on topological structures, at microwaves and optical frequencies.

Here it is shown that the quantized Zak phase and nontrivial edge states, partially protected by inversion symmetry rather than chiral symmetry, can be observed and probed in the bulk exploiting continuous-time photonic quantum walk in zig-zag waveguide arrays. The averaged beam displacement measurements can detect quantized Zak phase and nontrivial topological phases in the extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with broken chiral symmetry.

ABSTRACT: Noncontractible loop states (NLSs) are a recently realized topological entity in flatband lattices, arising typically from the band touching at a point where a flat band intersects one or more dispersive bands. There exists also band touching across a plane, where one flat band overlaps another all over the Brillouin zone without crossing a dispersive band. Such isolated plane-touching flat bands remain largely unexplored. For example, what are the topological features associated with such flatband degeneracy? Here, nontrivial NLSs and robust boundary modes in a system with such degeneracy are demonstrated. Based on a tailored photonic lattice constructed from the well-known fractal Sierpinski gasket, the wavefunction singularities and the conditions for the existence of the NLSs are theoretically analyzed. It is shown that the NLSs can exist in both singular and nonsingular flat bands, as a direct reflection of the real-space topology. Experimentally, directly such flatband NLSs in a laser-written Corbino-shaped fractal-like lattice are observed. This work not only leads to a deep understanding of the mechanism behind the nontrivial flatband states, but also opens up new avenues to explore fundamental phenomena arising from the interplay of flatband degeneracy, fractal structures, and band topology.

ABSTRACT: Achieving robust propagation and guiding of electromagnetic waves through complex and disordered structures is a major goal of modern photonics research, for both classical and quantum applications. Although the realization of backscattering-free and disorder-immune guided waves has recently become possible through various photonic schemes inspired by topological insulators in condensed matter physics, the interaction between such topologically protected guided waves and free-space propagating waves remains mostly unexplored, especially in the context of scattering systems. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that free-space propagating plane waves can be efficiently coupled into topological one-way surface waves, which can seamlessly flow around sharp corners and electrically large barriers and release their energy back into free space in the form of leaky-wave radiation. We exploit this physical mechanism to realize topologically protected wave-rerouting around an electrically large impenetrable object of complex shape, with transmission efficiency exceeding 90%, over a relatively broad bandwidth. The proposed topological wave-rerouting scheme is based on a stratified structure composed of a topologically nontrivial magnetized plasmonic material coated by a suitable isotropic layer. Our results may open a new avenue in the field of topological photonics and electromagnetics, for applications that require engineered interactions between guided waves and free-space propagating waves, including for complex beam-routing systems and advanced stealth technology. More generally, our work may pave the way for robust defect/damage-immune scattering and radiating systems.

ABSTRACT: Electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) is widely studied in atomic systems and metamaterials. However, there are few studies of EIT on topological insulator (TI). In this paper, the EIT effect is studied in TI which is placed on the dielectric substrate by finite difference time domain (FDTD) method. We discussed the effective permittivity of TI layer on different temperature at terahertz (THz) range. The EIT-like phenomenon can be obtained at transverse electromagnetic (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) mode. The parameters of dielectric substrate and TI layer are investigated to tune the EIT phenomenon. Moreover, incident angle of electromagnetic (EM) wave is also studied to influence the transmission of the structure. The result was shown the large incident angle and polarization insensitive EIT effect can be realized. The results can provide some potential applications such as terahertz switches, filters and terahertz communications.

ABSTRACT: An efficient numerical algorithm is the key for accurate evaluation of density of states (DOS) in band theory. The Gilat-Raubenheimer (GR) method proposed in 1966 is an efficient linear extrapolation method which was limited in specific lattices. Here, using an affine transformation, we provide a new generalization of the original GR method to any Bravais lattices and show that it is superior to the tetrahedron method and the adaptive Gaussian broadening method. Finally, we apply our generalized GR. method to compute DOS of various gyroid photonic crystals of topological degeneracies.

ABSTRACT: Holography has extremely extensive applications in conventional optical instruments spanning optical microscopy and imaging, three-dimensional displays and metrology. To integrate holography with modern low-dimensional electronic devices, holograms need to be thinned to a nanometric scale. However, to keep a pronounced phase shift modulation, the thickness of holograms has been generally limited to the optical wavelength scale, which hinders their integration with ultrathin electronic devices. Here, we break this limit and achieve 60 nm holograms using a topological insulator material. We discover that nanometric topological insulator thin films act as an intrinsic optical resonant cavity due to the unequal refractive indices in their metallic surfaces and bulk. The resonant cavity leads to enhancement of phase shifts and thus the holographic imaging. Our work paves a way towards integrating holography with flat electronic devices for optical imaging, data storage and information security.

ABSTRACT:  COHERENT OPTICS OF ORDERED AND RANDOM MEDIA III" The structure of the phase arising when a probing light beam passes an optical system is analyzed. Its value is determined by the length of the optical path of the beam, by the geometry of the trajectory and by the optical properties of the reflecting surface. This phase is a sum of the linear phase, the Fresnel phase and the Rytov-Vladimirski phase. An interferometer measures the sum of all these separate phases. We propose a method to extract these separate phases from the total one and, therefore, determine the corresponding characteristics of the object. In the case of an isotropic object the explicit formulas are found. The device based on this approach combines the properties of both a profilometer and an ellipsometer.

ABSTRACT: We report on the observation of a topologically protected edge state at the interface between two topologically distinct domains of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, which we implement in arrays of evanescently coupled dielectric-loaded surface-plasmon polariton waveguides. Direct evidence of the topological character of the edge state is obtained through several independent experiments: Its spatial localization at the interface as well as the restriction to one sublattice is confirmed by real-space leakage radiation microscopy. The corresponding momentum-resolved spectrum obtained by Fourier imaging reveals the midgap position of the edge state as predicted by theory.

Theoretical models and calculations were conducted to predict the topological charge distribution of the emitted vortex laser. Utilizing a reflective spatial light modulator that creates a spiral-phase defect of variable radius and azimuthal phase modulation, vortex beams with controllable topological charges and intensity distributions were demonstrated experimentally.

ABSTRACT: Recently, the study of non-Hermitian physics has attracted considerable attention. The modified bulk-boundary correspondence has been proposed to understand topological edge states in non-Hermitian static systems. Here, a new experimental observation of edge states in non-Hermitian time-driven systems (quantum walks) is reported. Topologically edge states protected by Hermitian conjugation of particle-hole symmetry (PHS dagger) are found in the unbroken parity-time (PT)-symmetric phase. When the system changes from the unbroken to the broken PT-symmetric phase, the topological phase transition occurs accompanied by the change of the number of edge states. The robust properties of these edge states against static perturbations and disorder are also demonstrated experimentally. The finding of robust edge states in non-Hermitian systems inspires to explore a robust transport channel in ubiquitously complex systems with strong dissipation.

ABSTRACT: We present a systematic approach for topological design of a high transmission metallic nano-aperture. The layout of the metallic layer is determined by the ON/OFF design method to maximize the norm value of the near-field intensity. Combined with the numerical finite element method, we derive a quadruple-ridge aperture composed of bowtie like shape with adjoining holes, and numerical results show that the location of the holes affects not only the transmission peak intensity, but also the field confinement because of the surface wave reflected from the adjoining holes. Results verify that the ON/OFF method to be a useful tool for obtaining an effective aperture shape.

ABSTRACT: "The zero-magnetic-field nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE) refers to the second-order transverse current induced by an applied alternating electric field  it indicates the topological properties of inversion-symmetry-breaking crystals. Despite several studies on the NLHE induced by the Berry-curvature dipole in Weyl semimetals, the direct current conversion by rectification is limited to very low driving frequencies and cryogenic temperatures. The nonlinear photoresponse generated by the NLHE at room temperature can be useful for numerous applications in communication, sensing, and photodetection across a high bandwidth. In this study, observations of the second-order NLHE in type-II Dirac semimetal CoTe2 under time-reversal symmetry are reported. This is determined by the disorder-induced extrinsic contribution on the broken-inversion-symmetry surface and room-temperature terahertz rectification without the need for semiconductor junctions or bias voltage. It is shown that remarkable photoresponsivity over 0.1 A W-1, a response time of approximately 710 ns, and a mean noise equivalent power of 1 pW Hz(-1/2) can be achieved at room temperature. The results open a new pathway for low-energy photon harvesting via nonlinear rectification induced by the NLHE in strongly spin-orbit-coupled and inversion-symmetry-breaking systems, promising a considerable impact in the field of infrared/terahertz photonics."

ABSTRACT: "Spoof surface plasmon-polariton is a type of surface wave (SW) propagating at the artificially engineered structures in microwave and terahertz ranges. These SWs are highly important in planar photonic and on-chip devices, integrated circuits, lenses, sensors, and antennas applications. However, it is still a challenge to control the propagation regime of such SWs including the wavefront shapes and propagation directions. In this letter, we study the SWs in bilayer hyperbolic metasurfaces and show that the interplay between two layers allows them to manage their regime of propagation. We demonstrate the switching between the angle and number of propagation directions of SWs at the same frequency. Finally, we demonstrate experimentally the tunable multidirectional in-plane canalization of SWs by adjusting the directions of their propagation within the angular range from 0 & amp DEG  to 12.8 & amp DEG . The discovered rotation-mediated interlayer coupling of hyperbolic metasurfaces paves the way toward efficient in-plane transfer of localized electromagnetic signals."

ABSTRACT: We design and present a switchable slow light rainbow trapping (SLRT) state in a strongly coupling topological photonic system made from a magneto-optical photonic crystal waveguide channel. The waveguide channel supports slow light states with extremely small group velocity (v(g) = 2.1 x 10(-6) c), low group-velocity dispersion, and a broadband operation bandwidth (3.60-4.48 GHz, near 22% of bandwidth). These slow light states originate from the strong coupling between two counter propagating topological photonic states. Under a gradient magnetic field, different frequency components of a wave packet are separated and stored at different positions for a long temporal duration with high spatial precision (without crosstalk and overlap between the electric fields of different frequencies) to form SLRT. Besides, these SLRT states can be easily switched among the forbidden state, trapped state, and releasing state by tuning the external magnetic field. The results suggest that the topological photonic state can offer a precise route of spatial-temporal-spectral control upon a light signal and find applications for optical buffers, broadband slow light systems, optical filters, wavelength-division multiplexing, and other optical communication devices.

ABSTRACT: The hyperbolic materials are strongly anisotropic media with a permittivity/permeability tensor having diagonal components of different sign. They combine the properties of dielectric and metal-like media and are described with hyperbolic isofrequency surfaces in wave-vector space. Such media may support unusual effects like negative refraction, near-field radiation enhancement and nanoscale light confinement. They were demonstrated mainly for microwave and infrared frequency ranges on the basis of metamaterials and natural anisotropic materials correspondingly. For the terahertz region, the tunable hyperbolic media were demonstrated only theoretically. This paper is dedicated to the first experimental demonstration of an optically tunable terahertz hyperbolic medium in 0.2-1.0 THz frequency range. The negative phase shift of a THz wave transmitted through the structure consisting of 40 nm (in relation to THz wave transmitted through substrate) to 120 nm bismuth film (in relation to both THz waves transmitted through substrate and air) on 21 mu m mica substrate is shown. The optical switching of topological transition between elliptic and hyperbolic isofrequency contours is demonstrated for the effective structure consisting of 40 nm Bi on mica. For the case of 120 nm Bi on mica, the effective permittivity is only hyperbolic in the studied range. It is shown that the in-plane component of the effective permittivity tensor may be positive or negative depending on the frequency of THz radiation and continuous-wave optical pumping power (with a wavelength of 980 nm), while the orthogonal one is always positive. The proposed optically tunable structure may be useful for application in various fields of the modern terahertz photonics.

ABSTRACT: The physical origin of the fractal topological band-gap structure in the one-dimensional Thue-Morse system has been revealed, which is characterized by the evolutions of two types of topological singularities with zero-scattering properties and the paths of phase vortex points, which are the mirrored paths of the first-type singularities. The field distribution of the upper and lower gap-edge states will interchange when the traditional gaps are closed and reopened. The topologically protected edge-states are found at both traditional gaps and fractal gaps. Our work broadens the topological properties of quasicrystals or aperiodic systems and provides potential applications in new optoelectronic devices. (C) 2021 Chinese Laser Press

ABSTRACT: Surface plasmons make a high degree of localization of electromagnetic fields achievable at the vicinity of metal surfaces. Topological insulators (TIs) are a family of materials which are insulating in the bulk but have metallic surfaces caused by the strong spinorbit coupling. Surface plasmons supported by the surface state on topological insulators have attracted incredible interests from ultraviolet to mid-infrared frequencies. In this work, we experimentally investigate the near-field properties of Bi2Te3 nanosheets using scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM). The s-SNOM tip enables to detect significantly enhanced intensity in its near field at precisely controlled positions with regards to Bi2Te3 structure. With the help of highly position-selective excitation and high-pixel real-space mapping, we discover near-field patterns of bright outside fringes which are associated with its surface-metallic, plasmonic behavior at mid-infrared frequency. Thereby, we experimentally demonstrate that the scattered signal responses and near-field amplitudes of outside fringes can be tailored via mechanical (sheet thickness of Bi2Te3), electric (electrostatic gating), and optical (incident wavelength) fashions. The discovery of outside fringes in TI nanosheets may enable the development of strongly enhanced lightmatter interactions for quantum optical devices, mid-infrared (MIR) and terahertz detectors or sensors.

ABSTRACT: "Floquet topological photonic insulators characterized by periodically varying Hamiltonians are known to exhibit much richer topological behaviors than static systems. In a Floquet insulator, the phase evolution of the Floquet-Bloch modes plays a crucial role in determining its topological behaviors. Here, we show that by perturbing the driving sequence, it is possible to manipulate the cyclic phase change in the system over each evolution period to induce self-interference of a bulk mode, leading to a resonance effect, which can be regarded as a Floquet counterpart of defect-mode resonance in static lattices. This Floquet Defect Mode Resonance (FDMR) is cavity-less since it does not require physical boundaries  its spatial localization pattern is, instead, determined by the driving sequence and is found to be different in topologically trivial and nontrivial lattices. We demonstrated excitation of FDMRs by edge modes in a Floquet octagon lattice on silicon-on-insulator, achieving extrinsic quality factors greater than 10(4). Imaging of the scattered light pattern directly revealed the hopping sequence of the Floquet system and confirmed the spatial localization of FDMR in a bulk-mode loop. The new Floquet topological resonator could find various applications in lasers, optical filters and switches, nonlinear cavity optics, and quantum optics."

ABSTRACT: The valley is a flexible degree of freedom for light manipulation in photonic systems. In this work, we introduce the valley concept in magnetic photonic crystals with broken inversion symmetry. One-way propagation of bulk states is demonstrated by exploiting the pseudo-gap where bulk states only exist at one single valley. In addition, the transition between Hall and valley-Hall nontrivial topological phases is also studied in terms of the competition between the broken inversion and time-reversal symmetries. At the photonic boundary between two topologically distinct photonic crystals, we illustrate the one-way propagation of edge states and demonstrate their robustness against defects.

ABSTRACT: Plasma blackout, which contains ablative impurities, strongly attenuates the signal of the reentry spacecraft. Traditional methods focus on mitigating electron densities and impurities around the antenna, and metamaterial-based electromagnetic methods have yet to be proven experimentally. We simulate the plasma blackout problem using laboratory plasma supported by gas discharge technology. Alumina pillars are embedded in the plasma background to form plasma photonic crystals, while topological phase transitions are achieved by shrinking and expanding pillars within a unit cell. The topological edge states (TESs) that are insensitive to weak impurities in the transport path are verified theoretically and experimentally. We introduce the glide-reflection (GR) symmetry in the nontrivial lattices to obtain the gapless edge states, which are exclusively observed in the acoustic systems. Meanwhile, the.. of the gapless TES increases with the electron densities, ensuring a wide communication bandwidth. Furthermore, the strong coupling of heterostructure with GR symmetry in plasma photonic crystals is elucidated. Our work not only provides a new approach to the blackout communication problem but can also serve as a nascent experimental platform to investigate topological electromagnetic phenomena.

ABSTRACT: Nonlinear optical limiting, which enables dynamic radiation filtration, has important implications for photonics, medicine, and advanced manufacturing. A major challenge is the scalable fabrication of all-inorganic materials with good stability, high optical quality, and excellent optical limiting performance. Herein, a topological engineering strategy is presented for constructing all-inorganic composite titanate glass with robust performance in optical radiation control. Notably, the rational control of the topological configuration of highly polarized species and their local organization leads to the considerable enhancement of two-photon absorption coefficients (approximate to 7 times). Mechanical response can also be improved with an estimated elastic modulus and hardness of 10.5 and 115.4 GPa, respectively. This improvement allows the creation of novel all-inorganic composite materials with excellent ability for dynamic optical radiation filtration. Results suggest that the proposed topological engineering strategy for constructing titanate glass can be extended to other highly polarized glass systems to develop a new generation of nonlinear photonic materials.

ABSTRACT: "The invention of the laser has revolutionized modern science and engineering as well as our daily lives. Recently, a new class of lasers based on concepts borrowed from parity-time symmetry in quantum mechanics has emerged. Parity-time symmetry, initially applied to condensed matter systems, extends canonical quantum theory to non-Hermitian quantum theory. The experimental exploration of parity-time symmetry in electronics is challenging  so by analogy, such concept is introduced in photonics where flexibility exists in realizing non-Hermitian eigenstates involving optical gain and loss. Lasers intrinsically involve both gain and loss, which makes them the natural candidates to explore and exploit parity-time symmetry in photonics. Recent studies have demonstrated various novel laser devices based on parity-time symmetry, which show unique properties such as single mode lasing, chiral mode lasing, and exceptional point enhanced sensing. In this review, the fundamentals are introduced and recent advances in parity-time symmetric laser devices are discussed, furthermore an outlook on this emergent field is provided."

ABSTRACT: We report the edge states and non-zero boundary charges in one-dimensional photonic crystals (1D PhCs) without inversion symmetry. In contrast to common 1D systems, we show that edge states corresponding to non-zero boundary charges do exist in these asymmetric 1D PhCs even if we cannot obtain non-integral topological invariants. Moreover, an edge state could be observed in the interface between the PhC without inversion symmetry and the well-defined trivial PhC. Finally, the origin of the non-quantized boundary charges is unveiled by the non-central Wannier center. Not only exact solutions of photonic systems, but the above topological phenomena can also be found in the tight-binding models. This work proposes a way to study the 1D symmetries-broken systems and provides models to show the topological origin of boundary charges, which is suitable for both classic systems and quantum systems.

ABSTRACT: Recently, optical bound states in continuum (BICs) incorporated with optical gain have been reported to exhibit lasing. Here, it is shown that each of the four BICs supported by C4v$_{4v}$ symmetric photonic crystal slab can be made to lase, allowing the control over the topological charge of the resulting laser beam. The type of each BIC and their topological charges are identified by imaging the far-field polarization vortices of the lasing signal. Results are compared with experimentally obtained dispersions, finite element method simulations, and multipole decomposition method based on the microscopic polarization currents in the photonic crystal plane. A demonstration of multimode lasing of two non-degenerate BICs with opposite topological charges is presented. The momentum space overlap of the BICs results in a unique polarization pattern. The study provides a generalizable example for engineering the topological properties of coherent light.

ABSTRACT: Research interest in resonance and topology for systems at near-zero frequency, whose wavelength could be 2 orders larger than the scale of resonators is very rare, since the trivial effective-medium theory is generally thought to be correct in this regime. Also, the complex frequency regime is generally thought to be irrelevant to the topological properties of Hermitian systems. In this work, we find the general conditions to realize nearzero frequency resonance for a resonator and theoretically propose two kinds of realizations of such resonators, which are confirmed by numerical methods. The photonic crystals with such a resonator as the unit cell present rich topological characteristics at the near-zero frequency regime. The topological singularity that corresponds to the resonant frequency of the unit cell can be pushed to zero frequency at the bottom of the first band by tuning a certain parameter to a critical value. Surprisingly, we find that, when the parameter is tuned over the critical value, the singularity has disappeared in the first band and is pushed into the imaginary frequency regime, but now the topology of the first band and gap is still nontrivial, which is demonstrated by the existence of the topological edge state in the first gap, the negative sign of imaginary part of the surface impedance, and the symmetry property of Wannier functions. So, we are forced to accept that the singularity in the imaginary frequency regime can influence the topology in the real frequency regime. So, for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, we find that the singularity in the pure imaginary regime can still cause the observable topological effects on the real frequency regime, even for the Hermitian systems. Now, zero frequency acts as a novel exceptional point for Hermitian systems and the topology of the first band and first gap could be quite different from other bands and gaps, since they are intrinsically connected with zero frequency. Other new phenomena are also observed when the singularity is at the near-zero frequency regimes (real or imaginary), e.g., the cubic relationship between reflection coefficient and the frequency, the robust wide-bandwidth high transmission at very low frequency, etc. Besides the theoretical importance, some basic applications, such as the robust deep subwavelength wide bandwidth hightransmission layered structures, the subwavelength wide bandwidth absorbers, and the cavity from the topological subwavelength edge state are proposed, which can inspire new designs in many areas of optics, microwaves, and acoustics. This work opens a new window for rich topological physics and revolutionary device designs at the near and beyond zero-frequency regimes. (C) 2021 Chinese Laser Press

ABSTRACT: Topological insulators have been theoretically predicted as promising candidates for broadband photonics devices due to its large bulk band gap states in association with the spin-momentum-locked mass-less Dirac edge/surface states. Unlike the bulk counterpart, few-layer topological insulators possess some intrinsic optical advantages, such as low optical loss, low saturation intensity and high concentration of surface state. Herein, we use a solvothermal method to prepare few-layer Bi2Te3 flakes. By sandwiching few-layer Bi2Te3 flakes with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) polymer, a novel light modulation device had been successfully fabricated with high chemical and thermal stabilities as well as excellent mechanical durability, originating from the contribution of PMMA acting as buffer layers that counteract excessive mechanical bending within the fragile Bi2Te3 flakes. The incorporation of the as-fabricated PMMA-TI-PMMA as saturable absorber, which could bear long-term mechanical loadings, into the fiber laser cavity generated the stable dissipative soliton mode-locking with a 3-dB spectral bandwidth up to 51.62 nm and tunable wavelength range of 22 nm. Our work provides a new way of fabricating PMMA-TI-PMMA sandwiched composite structure as saturable absorber with promising applications for laser operation. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America

ABSTRACT: We propose a hybrid structure where graphene is inserted to the interface of two one-dimensional photonic crystals (1D PCs). The two PCs are designed to have opposite topological properties, and at the interface, topological edge modes exist. The edge modes exist at both the fundamental frequency (FF) and the third harmonic (TH) frequency. This double resonant structure will enhance the nonlinear responses of graphene greatly, including Kerr nonlinearity and TH generation. We discuss these two kinds of nonlinearities both at terahertz (THz) and near-infrared (NIR) frequencies. The influence of Kerr nonlinearity on the resonant frequencies is considered, when we calculate the TH generation. At THz frequency, low-threshold bistability (about 8MW/cm(2)) is obtained and the TH generation efficiency of 2.5% is achieved with incident intensity of 10MW/cm(2). At NIR frequency, the nonlinear conductivities of graphene are about 7 orders lower. Bistability is unlikely to happen with incident intensity below 1GW/cm(2). The TH generation efficiency is only about 5x10(-6) with incident intensity of 25MW/cm(2). The proposed structure is more suitable to work as a low-threshold saturable absorber at NM frequency. These results may be helpful both tbr a better understanding of graphene's nonlinear responses in a double resonant structure and for potential applications in THz nonlinear devices and NIR nanophotonics.

In this paper we report on the concept and technical implementation of a fast topological trigger system, that makes use of real time image processing of individual camera patterns and their combination in a stereoscopic array analysis. A prototype system is currently under construction and we discuss the design and hardware of this topological array trigger system.

ABSTRACT: Metal-organic frameworks(MOFs) are emerging materials for luminescent and photochemical applications. Armed with femto to millisecond spectroscopies, and fluorescence microscopy, the photobehaviors of two Ce-based MOFs are unravelled: Ce-NU-1000 and Ce-CAU-24-TBAPy. It is observed that both MOFs show ligand-to-duster charge transfer reactions in approximate to 100 and approximate to 70 fs for Ce-NU-1000 and Ce-CAU-24-TBAPy, respectively. The formed charge separated states, resulting in electron and hole generation, recombine in different times for each MOF, being longer in Ce-CAU-24-TBAPy: 1.59 and 13.43 mu s than in Ce-NU-1000: 0.64 and 4.91 mu s. The linkers in both MOFs also undergo a very fast intramolecular charge transfer reaction in approximate to 160 fs. Furthermore, the Ce-NU-1000 MOF reveals excimer formation in 50 ps, and lifetime of approximate to 14 ns. The lack of this interlinkers event in Ce-CAU-24-TBAPy arises from topological restriction and demonstrates the structural differences between the two frameworks. Single-crystal fluorescence microscopy of Ce-CAU-24-TBAPy shows the presence of a random distribution of defects along the whole crystal, and their impact on the observed photobehavior. These findings reflect the effect of linkers topology and metal clusters orientations on the outcome of electronic excitation of reticular structure, key to their applicability in different fields of science and technology, such as photocatalysis and photonics.

ABSTRACT: Topological line defects are ubiquitous in nature and appear at all physical scales, including in condensed matter systems, nuclear physics, and cosmology. Particularly useful systems to study line defects are nematic liquid crystals (LCs), where they describe singular or nonsingular frustrations in orientational order and are referred to as disclinations. In nematic LCs, line defects could be relatively simply created, manipulated, and observed. We consider cases where disclinations are stabilized either topologically in plane-parallel confinements or by chirality. In the former case, we report on studies in which defect core transformations are investigated, the intriguing dynamics of strength disclinations in LCs exhibiting negative dielectric anisotropy, and stabilization and manipulation of assemblies of defects. For the case of chiral nematics, we consider nanoparticle-driven stabilization of defect lattices. The resulting line defect assemblies could pave the way to several applications in photonics, sensitive detectors, and information storage devices. These excitations, moreover, have numerous analogs in other branches of physics. Studying their universal properties in nematics could deepen understanding of several phenomena, which are still unresolved at the fundamental level.

ABSTRACT: Titanium nitride (TiN) with outstanding physical and chemical properties has earned considerable attention. However, few studies have been conducted on the ability of TiN in the ultrafast photonics field. In this study, ultrafast fiber lasers operating at 1.5 and 2 mu m were realized using TiN nanoparticles (NPs) deposited onto a D-shaped fiber (DF) as the optical modulator. TiN NPs were synthesized via a reduction-nitridation route. As the TiN-DF saturable absorber (SA) was integrated into the erbium-doped fiber laser (EDFL) and thulium-doped fiber laser (TDFL) cavities, femtosecond pulses of 1532 nm and 1960 nm were obtained with high performance. To the best of our knowledge, the mode-locked fiber laser operating around 1530 nm was realized for the first time. Interestingly, TiN-DF SA in the TDFL could be used as a temperature sensitive device, and a novel temperature sensor was proposed with the sensitivity of 88 pm degrees C-1. Our results verified that TiN-DF modulators are excellent nonlinear optical devices for ultrafast photonic applications.

ABSTRACT: In this paper, we present the experimental results for integrated photonic devices optimized with an energy-constrained inverse design method. When this constraint is applied, optimizations are directed to solutions that contain the optical field inside the waveguide core medium, leading to more robust designs with relatively larger minimum feature size. We optimize three components: a mode converter (MC), a 1310 nm/1550 nm wavelength duplexer, and a three-channel C-band wavelength demultiplexer for coarse wavelength division multiplexing (CWDM) application with 50 nm channel spacing. The energy constraint leads to nearly binarized structures without applying independent binarization stage. It also reduces the appearance of small features. In the MC, well-binarized design, improved insertion loss, and cross talk are obtained as a result. Furthermore, the proposed constraint improves the robustness to fabrication imperfections as shown in the duplexer design. With energy constraint optimization, the corresponding spectrum shifts for the duplexer under +/- 10 nm dimensional variations are reduced from 105 nm to 55 nm and from 72 nm to 60 nm for the 1310 nm and 1550 nm channel, respectively. In the CWDM demultiplexer, robustness toward +/- 10 nm fabrication error is improved by a factor of 2. The introduction of the energy constraint into topological optimization demonstrates computational gain with better-performing designs. (C) 2022 Chinese Laser Press

ABSTRACT: Non-Hermitian topological band structures such as symmetry-protected exceptional rings (SPERs) can emerge for systems described by the generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP) with Hermitian matrices. In this paper, we numerically analyze a photonic crystal with negative index media, which is described by the GEVP with Hermitian matrices. Our analysis using COMSOL Multiphysics((R)) demonstrates that a SPER emerges for photonic crystals composed of split-ring resonators and metal-wire structures. We expect that the above SPER can be observed in experiments as it emerges at a finite frequency.

ABSTRACT: Polarization-sensitive devices rely on meta-materials to exhibit varying degrees of absorption of light of a given handedness. The chiral surface states of a topological insulator selectively absorb right-and left-circularly polarized light in the vicinity of the Dirac cone reaching its maximum of unity at the Gamma point. In this letter, we show that a band gap open topological insulator with C-2 upsilon symmetry, which is represented through a combination of Rashba and Dresselhaus Hamiltonians, alters the preferential absorption of left-and right-circularly polarized light allowing a smooth variation of the circular dichroism. This variation in circular dichroism, in a range of positive and negative values, is shown to be a function of the Rashba and Dresselhaus coupling parameters. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.

ABSTRACT: Maintaining a population inversion in electron distributions is the first step towards lasing. There is a strong interest in realizing the inversion in a Dirac conical band structure, because broad-band lasing may then be realized owing to the zero-gap nature of the Dirac cone. Here we show that the population inversion can be elongated to >7 ps at 8 K and >10 ps at 300 K on the surface of a p-type topological insulator (Sb0.73Bi0.27)(2)Te-3. Time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy gives us the direct evidence for the elongated duration of the inversion in the topological surface states. We hereby provide a guideline to prolong the population inversion at finite temperatures. Our study strengthens the route toward the Dirac materials to be a lasing medium.

ABSTRACT: We demonstrated a passively Q-switched 2.8-mu m Er3+-doped ZBLAN fiber laser with topological insulator Bi2Te3 nanosheets prepared by the solvothermal method. Enabled by the gold mirror with self-assembled Bi2Te3 nanosheets film sandwiched by polymethyl methacrylate polymer, the Q-switched fiber laser can deliver a maximum average power of 856 mW with corresponding pulse energy of 9.3 mu J and a pulse width of 1.3 mu s at a repetition rate of 92 kHz under the pump power 5.9 W. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest output power for the pulsed fluoride fiber laser around 2.8 mu m modulated by the two-dimensional Dirac material. This letter reveals that the topological insulator can be a kind of promising nonlinear modulator for a mid-infrared laser.

In the phonon framework, we can describe mechanics, elastic wave and thermal phenomena in solid uniformly. With the development of our understanding about solid state systems, phonon has become an important method to control device in solid state, which can be seen as a supplement and replacement for electronics and photonics. Among them, the modulation of elastic wave and heat conduction in phonon system has great theoretical and practical value. Elastic wave as an information carrier has the potential to construct new chip elements, while manipulating thermal phonon as an energy carrier can achieve the goal of energy transformation and device optimization. These fields have developed rapidly in recent years. A large number of novel materials such as thermal diodes, elastic meta-materials, thermal meta-materials, and heat pumping devices have been predicted and obtained. These developments are inseparable from the application of the concept of topology to phonon systems and the realization of non-reciprocal devices on various scales. In this paper, the topological and nonreciprocal phenomena in phonon systems are tentatively summarized. Besides, the latest research results are introduced and the development trend is prospected. The non-reciprocity of elastic wave and heat flow realized by time-dependent driving is reviewed with emphasis. This method has a great flexibility and can be similarly applied to multi-component systems on all scales.

ABSTRACT: Backscattering-immune propagation is one of the unique characteristics in topological photonic crystals. Such functionality can be realized by constructing a three-dimensional chiral channel in photonic crystals, of which the fabrication process cannot be compatible to complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor lithography. Here, we employed projection microstereolithography to fabricate a three-dimensional chiral channel surrounding in a photonic crystal template with the lattice constant of 462 mu m. Both projected band structure and Poynting vector patterns of the three-dimensional chiral channel are numerically calculated. Our work provides a feasible way to fabricate a backscattering-immune waveguide in three-dimensional photonic crystals.

ABSTRACT: This work proposes a quick measurement of the refractive index of dielectric nanofilm via a fabricated topological grating that comprises indium tin oxide (ITO) strips and nanowalls with an extremely high aspect ratio of 25. As the topological grating is capped with a dielectric nanofilm, the parabolic fields of the nanowalls destructively interfere with those of the ITO strips. This destructive interference weakens the photonic jets of the topological grating, decreasing its diffraction efficiency. The decrease in the diffraction efficiency determines the refractive index of the nanofilm without measuring its thickness in advance because the efficiency decrease is independent of the thickness. In other words, the photonic jets of the topological grating are manipulated by the refractive index of the nanofilm. The experimental results verify that refractive indices of titanium-dioxide, silicon-dioxide, and bovine-serum-albumin nanofilms with a thickness much smaller than the visible wavelengths can be measured by using the proposed topological grating. Therefore, topological gratings have great potential to develop advanced materials, fascinating devices, and innovative instruments.

ABSTRACT: We have studied the influence of a spacer in a multihelicoidal Bragg fiber with a twist defect on the emerging of localized topological states. We have shown that if such a fiber is excited with a Gaussian beam this leads to the appearance of a defect-localized mode, whose topological charge coincides with the order of rotational symmetry of the fiber's refractive index distribution. The influence of the spacer on this mode is studied.

ABSTRACT: Integrated optical waveguides have been widely explored in the context of quantum simulation for various physical models based on paraxial diffraction of light, which are described by an equivalent Schrodinger equation. The physics in these systems can be formulated using the tight-binding models, in which the coupling between the waveguides can be tuned independently in a wide range, providing an excellent platform for simulation of various phenomena. In this work, we build a tight-binding model with parameters transported directly from two coupled waveguides, which are controlled by dielectric constant change, site distance, and geometries. This design principle can greatly save the simulation and experimental cost in real implementation. As compared with results from the exact simulation based on Maxwell equations, our numerical results demonstrate that the physics of the one- or two-dimensional large lattice systems could be well described by our tight-binding model, exhibiting the excellent transferability of the parameters in two coupled waveguides. In addition, some applications are further discussed: we show how to realize the topological Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, kinked SSH model, and study their associated topological phases and edge modes. Some two-dimensional models based on our tight-binding models are also discussed. Lastly, more intriguing applications, such as nonlinearity or disorder-induced effect and generation of the gauge potential are also briefly discussed. Our work intuitively provides an effective reference route for designing models for experiments and demonstrates the practicality of using the tight-binding approximation to solve complicated models. The design principle demonstrated in this work paves the foundation for the application of optical waveguides based on more complicated models, and will be readily verified experimentally in the near future.

ABSTRACT: Modern elastic optical networking requires additional flexibility at each layer compared to the traditional approach. The application of the Software-defined Networking (SDN) paradigm can provide the required degrees of freedom. The implementation of optical SDN down to the physical layer requires the complete abstraction of network elements to support full control by the centralized controller. In this work, we propose a topological and technological agnostic model based on Machine Learning (ML) to abstract the behavior of optical switches for the computation of Quality-of-transmission (QoT) penalties and the definition of control states. Training and testing datasets are obtained synthetically by software simulation of the photonic switching structure. Results show the capability of the proposed method to predict QoT impairments with high accuracy, and we envision its application in a real-time control plane.

ABSTRACT: Soft material templating is a promising approach for assembling and manipulating nanoparticles structures. Due to the high sensitivity of soft matter systems to external stimuli, such composite materials exploit the soft surrounding medium to move or to reconfigure nano-structures or nano-objects as well as to tune their own properties. The use of topological defects in anisotropic fluids has been recently reported. Here, arrays of defect lines are created in planar-periodic nematic liquid crystal cells, wherein the nematic director undergoes static twist deformations separated by topological defects. Trapping and manipulation of the nanoparticles in disclinations are demonstrated and investigated by confocal fluorescence microscopy exploiting quantum dots. Nanoparticles gathering is observed during electrically controlled switching from orientational topological walls to disclinations. The external field is also used to perform displacement and deformation of the nanoparticies arrays, as well as their dynamical assembling and disassembling. The reported results substantiate the opportunities offered by defects architectures in anisotropic fluids as a successful bottom-up approach that enables versatile assembling and remote control of nanoparticles.

ABSTRACT: Singular beams with spatially variant field distributions have various fantastic applications. However, one of the significant challenges that hinder the wide application of singular beams is how to effectively identify the topological charge and the polarization order of arbitrary singular beams. We found that when a light beam with arbitrary polarization state illuminates a polarization-sensitive blazed-grating, the horizontal and vertical component can be separated from the incident beam. Based on this phenomenon, an effective method is proposed to probe the integral topological charge and polarization order of arbitrary singular beams. With this detection method, the vortex beam, cylindrical vector beam and cylindrical vector vortex beam with different topological charges and polarization orders have been experimentally identified. This effective detection method can be widely used to measure the topological charge and polarization order of arbitrary singular beams.

ABSTRACT: Femtosecond optical pulses have applications in optical communication, astronomical frequency combs, and laser spectroscopy. Here, a hybrid mode-locked erbium-doped fiber (EDF) laser with topological insulator (TI) is proposed, for the first time to our best knowledge. The pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method is employed to fabricate the fiber-taper TI saturable absorber (TISA). By virtue of the fiber-taper TISA, the hybrid EDF laser is passively mode-locked using the nonlinear polarization evolution (NPE), and emits 70 fs pulses at 1542 nm, whose 3 dB spectral width is 63 nm with a repetition rate and transfer efficiency of 95.4 MHz and 14.12%, respectively. Our experiments indicate that the proposed hybrid mode-locked EDF lasers have better performance to achieve shorter pulses with higher power and lower mode-locking threshold in the future.

ABSTRACT: We introduce a novel type of chiral spiral waveguide where the usual waveguide crossings are replaced by 100: 0 Multimode Interferometers (MMIs), i.e. 2x2 splitters that couple all the input light in the cross output port. Despite the topological equivalence with the standard configuration, we show how resorting to long MMIs has non-trivial advantages in terms of footprint and propagation length. An accurate analytic model is also introduced to show the impact of nonidealities on the spiral performances, including propagation loss and cross-talk. We have designed and fabricated three chiral spirals on our platform, based on 3 mu m thick silicon strip waveguides with 0.13 dB/cm propagation loss, and 1.58 mm long MMIs. The fabricated spirals have 7, 13 and 49 loops respectively, corresponding to the effective lengths 6.6 cm, 12.5 cm and 47.9 cm. The proposed model is successfully applied to the experimental results, highlighting MMI extinction ratio of about 16.5 dB and MMI loss of about 0.08 dB, that are much worse compared to the simulated 50 dB extinction and 0.01 dB loss. This imposes an upper limit to the number of rounds, because light takes shortcuts through the bar MMI ports. Nevertheless, the novel chiral spiral waveguides outperform what is achievable in mainstream silicon photonics platforms based on submicron waveguides in terms of length and propagation losses, and they are promising candidates for the realization of integrated gyroscopes. They can be significantly further improved by replacing the MMIs with adiabatic 100:0 splitters, ensuring lower cross-talk and broader bandwidth.

ABSTRACT: This paper describes a successful demonstration of S-band region wavelength output generated via a tunable Q-switch fiber laser with the topological insulator (TI) Bi2Se3 as a saturable absorber (SA). The modulation depth of the TI was measured as 11.1%, whereas the utilized 980-nm laser source operated at 100 mW pump power. By inserting the TI-SA between two ferrules and utilizing a tunable bandpass filter (TBPF), a stable and tunable Q-switching operation was achieved over the S-band wavelength region from 1493.6 to 1508.9 nm, wherein pulsewidth was 7.6 mu s, and the tunable repetition rate ranged from 26.1 to 36.6 kHz. The Q-switched pulses had maximum pulse energy of 6.1 nJ, as measured from 2.5% of the cavity output. The results provide evidence that a TI-based SA is suitable for pulsed laser operation in the S-band wavelength region and offers potential for further development as an ultrabroadband photonics device.

ABSTRACT: Optical vortices with tunable properties in multiple dimensions are highly desirable in modern photonics, particularly for broadly tunable wavelengths and topological charges at the micrometer scale. Compared to solid-state approaches, here we demonstrate tunable optical vortices through the fusion of optofluidics and vortex beams in which the handedness, topological charges, and lasing wavelengths could be fully adjusted and dynamically controlled. Nanogroove structures inscribed in Fabry-Perot optofluidic microcavities were proposed to generate optical vortices by converting Hermite-Gaussian laser modes. Topological charges could be controlled by tuning the lengths of the nanogroove structures. Vortex laser beams spanning a wide spectral band (430-630 nm) were achieved by alternating different liquid gain materials. Finally, dynamic switching of vortex laser wavelengths in real-time was realized through an optofluidic vortex microlaser device. The findings provide a robust yet flexible approach for generating on-chip vortex sources with multiple dimensions, high tunability, and reconfigurability.

ABSTRACT: Waveguide tapers are seemingly indispensable elements in silicon photonics that usually operate adiabatically to maximize the coupling efficiency between waveguides with different cross-sections, which, however, necessitate large footprints. To date, great efforts have been made to minimize the tapers' footprints while maintaining their efficiency. Contrary to conventional wisdom, here, a concept of taper-free waveguides is proposed in which waveguides with different cross-sections couple with each other efficiently without using tapers, which are enabled by the recently discovered photonic topological phases. This concept is experimentally demonstrated on an all-silicon on-chip terahertz (THz) wave platform. It is further shown that the topologically enabled taper-free waveguides are robust against sharp corners and large-area potential barriers. This work provides a promising taper-free solution for future compact optical/THz photonic integrated circuits.

ABSTRACT: Modern light generation technology offers extraordinary capabilities for sculpting light pulses, with full control over individual electric field oscillations within each laser cycle(1-3). These capabilities are at the core of lightwave electronics-the dream of ultrafast lightwave control over electron dynamics in solids on a sub-cycle timescale, aiming at information processing at petahertz rates(4-8). Here, bringing the frequency-domain concept of topological Floquet systems(9,10) to the few-femtosecond time domain, we develop a theoretical method that can be implemented with existing technology, to control the topological properties of two-dimensional materials on few-femtosecond timescales by controlling the sub-cycle structure of non-resonant driving fields. We use this method to propose an all-optical, non-element-specific technique, physically transparent in real space, to coherently write, manipulate and read selective valley excitation using fields carried in a wide range of frequencies and on timescales that are orders of magnitude shorter than the valley lifetime, crucial for the implementation of valleytronic devices(11,12). A method to control the topological properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials on few-femtosecond timescales is proposed. By controlling the sub-cycle structure of non-resonant driving fields, it may be possible to coherently write, manipulate and read selective valley excitation.

ABSTRACT: The recent realization of valley physics in photonic systems has enriched the topological phases of light with protected edge modes and shown applications in designing high-performance photonic devices. However, the widely reported valley Hall effect of light in two-dimensional systems is limited to one single polarization. Here, we present dual-polarization two-dimensional valley photonic crystals by simultaneously opening two frequency accidental degenerate Dirac cones. Two band gaps with different polarizations are characterized by opposite-valley Chern numbers, which are confirmed by the opposite-phase vortex distributions of bulk modes and opposite Berry curvatures. This situation results in the polarization-dependent refraction of bulk and edge modes, which locate in opposite valleys. The polarization-independent topological valley transport is also demonstrated. Our work shows the flexible control of light in topological photonic systems with a polarization degree of freedom and has applications in polarization multiplexing photonic devices.

ABSTRACT: Topologically protected states are important in realizing robust excitation transfer between distant sites in photonic lattices. Here, we propose an efficient gap-protected transfer of photons in a scalable one-dimensional waveguide array by transporting the topological defect state of a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. The separation between neighboring waveguides is designed according to the Jaynes-Cummings model. As a result, the zero-energy eigenstate is topologically protected from the extended states by a constant energy gap, which leads to a fast and robust excitation transfer. We also show that the transport can be further sped up by the quasi-periodic oscillation induced by the non-adiabatic effect. This scheme has potential applications in scalable quantum information processing.

ABSTRACT: Undesirable light scattering is a fundamental cause for photon loss in nanophotonics. Rayleigh backscattering can be particularly difficult to avoid in wave-guiding systems and arises from both material defects and geometric defects at the subwavelength scale. It has recently been shown that systems exhibiting chiral dispersion due to broken time-reversal symmetry (TRS) can naturally mitigate Rayleigh backscattering, yet this has never been explored in integrated photonics. Here we demonstrate the dynamic suppression of disorder-induced Rayleigh backscattering in integrated photonics even when defects are clearly present. Our experiments are performed using lithium niobate on insulator resonators in which TRS is broken through an electrically-driven acousto-optic interaction. We experimentally observe near-complete suppression of Rayleigh backscattering within the resonator by measuring the optical states and through direct measurements of the back-scattered light. We additionally provide a new and intuitive generalization argument that explains this suppression of backscattering as a form of topological protection in synthetic space.

ABSTRACT: The propagation properties of electromagnetic waves depend on media dispersion in momentum space, which can be characterized using isofrequency contours (IFCs). Normal linear-crossing metamaterials (NLCMMs), which undergo a new type of topological transition between two kinds of hyperbolic media, are attracting attention because of their potential as a new avenue for controlling light propagation and verifying unusual phenomena involving zero-index and hyperbolic media. Herein, the rotation of the optical axis is treated as a new degree of freedom and a tilted linear-crossing metamaterial (TLCMM) is theoretically proposed. Upon rotating the optical axis angle such that it is equal to the cone angle, it is found that this special TLCMM has the shape of a type-III Dirac cone, in condensed matter physics. Boundary conditions and the causality law are used to reveal that electromagnetic waves in this critical TLCMM can achieve abnormal refraction without reflection and filtering. Moreover, these phenomena are observed experimentally in a planar circuit-based system. The results regarding the manipulation of electromagnetic waves may enable their use in planar-integrated photonics, including for directional propagation, cloaking, and switching.

ABSTRACT: A hybrid computational method of plane-wave and cylindrical-wave expansions for distributed Bragg-reflector (DBR) pillars is proposed. The plane-wave expansion is employed to represent the one-dimensional periodic structure of the DBR. The cylindrical-wave expansion is employed to describe the scattering by circular pillars with the DBR structure inside. This formalism enables us to calculate the radiation fields, t matrices, scattering cross sections, photonic band structures, and quality factors of the DBR pillars. Furthermore, optical properties of arrayed DBR pillars are also investigated with the aid of the multiple-scattering method. Using this formalism, we demonstrate explicitly that high Q photonic band modes including the so-called bound states in continuum are obtained both in isolated and arrayed DBR pillars. We also present a novel formation of gapless Dirac-cone surface states in a three-dimensional photonic crystal composed of a two-dimensional periodic arrangement of core-shell DBR pillars.

ABSTRACT: Epsilon-near-zero and epsilon near-pole materials enable reflective systems supporting a class of symmetry-protected and accidental embedded eigenstates (EEs) characterized by a diverging phase resonance. Here we show that pairs of topologically protected scattering singularities necessarily emerge from EEs when a non-Hermitian parameter is introduced, lifting the degeneracy between oppositely charged singularities. The underlying topological charges are characterized by an integer winding number and appear as phase vortices of the complex reflection coefficient. By creating and annihilating them, we show that these singularities obey charge conservation, and provide versatile control of amplitude, phase, and polarization in reflection, with potential applications for polarization control and sensing.

ABSTRACT: The performance of integrated silicon photonic devices is sensitive to small structural variations that arise from imperfections in the nanofabrication process. This sensitivity is exacerbated for next generation devices that require fine feature sizes to push the limits of performance. In this work, we present a deep convolutional neural network model to predict fabrication variations in planar silicon photonic devices and verify their manufacturing feasibility prior to prototyping. Our model is trained on a modest set of scanning electron microscope images of structures that experience dimensional inaccuracies stemming from combined contributions from proximity effects in lithography and loading effects in dry etching. Our model quickly and accurately predicts over/under-etching, corner rounding, filling of narrow channels and holes, and washing away of small features in a photonic device. With this, the expected performance of a device can be predicted through an extra simulation and any necessary design corrections can be made prior to fabrication.

ABSTRACT: New structures with richer electromagnetic properties are in high demand for developing novel microwave and optic devices aimed at realizing fast light-based information transfer and information processing. Here we show theoretically that a topological photonic state exists in a hexagonal LC circuit with short-range textures in the inductance, which is induced by a band inversion between p- and d-like electromagnetic modes carrying orbital angular momentum, and realize this state experimentally in planar microstrip arrays. Measuring both amplitude and phase of the out-of-plane electric field accurately using microwave near-field techniques, we demonstrate directly that topological interfacial electromagnetic waves launched by a linearly polarized dipole source propagate in opposite directions according to the sign of the orbital angular momentum. The open planar structure adopted in the present approach leaves much room for including other elements useful for advanced information processing, such as electric/mechanical resonators, superconducting Josephson junctions and SQUIDs.

ABSTRACT: We consider a photonic lattice of nonlinear lossy resonators subjected to a coherent drive, where the system remembers its topological phase. Initially, the system is topologically trivial. After the application of an additional coherent pulse, the intensity is increased, which modifies the couplings in the system and then induces a topological phase transition. However, when the effect of the pulse dies out, the system does not go back to the trivial phase. Instead, it remembers the topological phase and maintains its topology acquired during the pulse application. The pulse can be used as a switch to trigger amplification of the topological modes. We further show that the amplification takes place at a different frequency as well as at a different position from those of the pulse, indicating frequency conversion and intensity transfer. Our work can be useful in triggering the different functionalities of active topological photonic devices.

ABSTRACT: Fine complex light structure, optical singularities and electroconductivty of nematic 5CB doped by multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were investigated. MWCNTs gather spontaneously to system of micro scale clusters with random fractal borders at small enough concentration. They are surrounded by the striped micro scale cladding which creates optical singularities in propagating laser beam. Applied transverse electric field above the Freedericksz initiates homeotropic arrangement of 5CB and the striped inversion walls between nanotubes clusters what diminishes free energy of a composite. Theory of their appearance and properties was built. Simultaneously the striped cladding disappears what can be treated as new mechanism of structure orientation nonlinearity in nonlinear photonics. Polarization singularities (circular C points) were measured firstly. Percolation of clusters enhances strongly electrical conductivity of the system and creates inversion walls even without applied field. Carbon nanotubes composites in LC form bridge between nano dopants and micro/macro system and are promising for applications. Elaborated protocol of singular optics inspection and characterization of LC nanocomposites is promising tool for applications in modern nanosience and technique.

ABSTRACT: We propose a method to determine the topological charge (TC) of a perfect vortex. With the phase shift technique, the perfect vortex and its conjugate beam exactly overlap and interfere. Consequently, the TC of a perfect vortex is determined by counting the number of interference fringes. This proposed method enables in situ determination of the TC of the perfect vortex without the need for additional optical elements, and it is immune to environmental vibration and parasitic interference.

ABSTRACT: A novel saturable absorber (SA) was fabricated by coating the topological insulator (TI) film on microfiber using pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method. The TISA device had an insertion loss of similar to 1.25 dB, a saturable intensity of 26.7 MW/cm(2), a modulation depth of similar to 5.7%, and a nonsaturable loss of 20.5%. Upon employing this SA device, we established a passively mode-locked EDFL and achieved nearly free-chirped soliton pulse with 286 fs of pulse duration and >73 dB of signal to noise ratio (SNR). This result clearly evidences that the PLD is an effective scheme for practical SA device fabrication.

ABSTRACT: "Emerging topological semimetals offer promise of realizing topological electronics enabled by terahertz (THz) current persistent against impurity scattering. Yet most fundamental issues remain on how to image nanoscale conductivity inhomogeneity. Here we show noninvasive and contactless conductivity mapping at THz-nm limit of electronic heterogeneity and nanostrip junctions in a Dirac material ZrTe5. A clear Dirac Fermion density transition, manifested as the exclusive THz conductivity contrast, is quantitatively analyzed and profiled on both sides of the junction. This also allows the determination of variable junction width of similar to 25-220 nm, depending on the THz conductivity contrast of adjacent strips. The unique THz-nm contrast is absent in mid-infrared nano-imaging measurements since topological semimetals with small Fermi pockets exhibit a better matching of their plasma frequency and scattering rate to the THz spectral region. The first-principles calculations provide two compelling implications: the conductivity nanocontrast can be induced by a small anisotropic strain, even less than 0.5%, due to an extreme strain sensitivity in ZrTe5  A nanoscale topological phase transition is realized across some junctions induced by the strain, between strong topological insulators (TIs) and weak TIs/Dirac semimetals (DSMs)."

ABSTRACT: Stanene is one of the most intriguing two-dimensional (2D) materials because of its nontrivial topological properties. Here, the optical properties from THz to UV of molecular beam deposited tin nanosheets on Al2O3(0001) are reported. The experimental absorption coefficient cannot be described in terms of metallic tin or tin oxides. Nonetheless, a similar optical behavior was predicted by theory for freestanding stanene, thus suggesting the formation of the 2D tin nanosheets with stanene-like properties. These findings show that 2D tin bears appealing optical properties in a broad range of the electromagnetic spectrum, thus paving the way to Xenes-based nanophotonics.

ABSTRACT: We introduce non-Hermitian plasmonic waveguide-cavity systems with topological edge states (TESs) at singular points. The compound unit cells of the structures consist of metal-dielectric-metal (MDM) stub resonators side-coupled to an MDM waveguide. We show that we can realize both a TES and an exceptional point at the same frequency when a proper amount of loss is introduced into a finite three-unit-cell structure. We also show that the finite structure can exhibit both a TES and a spectral singularity when a proper amount of gain is introduced into the structure. In addition, we show that we can simultaneously realize a unidirectional spectral singularity and a TES when proper amounts of loss and gain are introduced into the structure. We finally show that this singularity leads to extremely high sensitivity of the reflected light intensity to variations of the refractive index of the active materials in the structure. TESs at singular points could potentially contribute to the development of singularity- based plasmonic devices with enhanced performance. (C) 2022 Chinese Laser Press

ABSTRACT: Light trapping is a constant pursuit in photonics because of its importance in science and technology. Many mechanisms have been explored, including the use of mirrors made of materials or structures that forbid outgoing waves, and bound states in the continuum that are mirror-less but based on topology. Here we report a compound method, combining lateral mirrors and bound states in the continuum in a cooperative way, to achieve a class of on-chip optical cavities that have high quality factors and small modal volumes. Specifically, light is trapped in the transverse direction by the photonic band gap of the lateral hetero-structure and confined in the vertical direction by the constellation of multiple bound states in the continuum. As a result, unlike most bound states in the continuum found in photonic crystal slabs that are de-localized Bloch modes, we achieve light-trapping in all three dimensions and experimentally demonstrate quality factors as high as Q = 1.09 x 10(6) and modal volumes as low as V = 17.74 (lambda(0)/n)(3) in the telecommunication regime. We further prove the robustness of our method through the statistical study of multiple fabricated devices. Our work provides a new method of light trapping, which can find potential applications in photonic integration, nonlinear optics and quantum computing. (C) 2021 Science China Press.

ABSTRACT: A method to detect of the topological charge (TC) for vortex beams by using gradually changing-period spiral spoke grating (GCPSSG) is designed and experimentally demonstrated. The value of TC can be measured due to the fact that the diffraction spot will appear a bright high intensity when the TC is equal to the diffractive grating spoke number, and otherwise the central intensity remains doughnut-like structure. Meanwhile, the rotated direction of the twist fringes is opposite with the grating, therefore the sign of TC can be distinguished. Moreover, in addition to discussing the light beam illuminates the geometric center of the grating, the beam misalignment condition is also considered. In this case, the magnitude and sign of TC can be simultaneously detennined by the number and orientation of the bright spots, respectively. The experimental results indicate that this scheme is robust and effective because the GCPSSG shows good tolerance to environment vibration and beam misalignment for the TC diagnostics, which is anticipated to be useful for optical communication.

ABSTRACT: Polarization topological order of a cylindrical vector beam (CVB) can be defined as the repetition number of 360 degrees polarization state change along the azimuthal axis, with its sign denoting the rotating direction of the polarization. In order to detect CVBs with different order, a miniaturized polymer grating is proposed and demonstrated. The grating is almost pure phase modulated and polarization independent. The CVB modes with different orders or with the same order but opposite sign can easily be separated by adding a quarter wave plate and a polarizer. The experimental results are consistent with the theoretical predictions, thus validating our proposed method.

ABSTRACT: Domain walls are topological defects that occur at symmetry-breaking phase transitions. Although domain walls have been intensively studied in ferromagnetic materials, where they nucleate at the boundary of neighbouring regions of oppositely aligned magnetic dipoles, their equivalents in optics have not been fully explored so far. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the existence of a universal class of polarization domain walls in the form of localized polarization knots in conventional optical fibres. We exploit their binding properties for optical data transmission beyond the Kerr limits of normally dispersive fibres. In particular, we demonstrate how trapping energy in a well-defined train of polarization domain walls allows undistorted propagation of polarization knots at a rate of 28 GHz along a 10 km length of normally dispersive optical fibre. These results constitute the first experimental observation of kink-antikink solitary wave propagation in nonlinear fibre optics.

ABSTRACT: Silicon carbide and other group-IV binary materials with 1:1 stoichiometry are trivial semiconductors. Using first-principles calculations combined with a tight-binding model, we demonstrate two-dimensional (2D) silicon carbide materials (siligraphenes) with 1:3 and 3:1 stoichiometries are topological insulators (TIs) superior to graphene. Dirac cones and topologically nontrivial electronic structures are predicted in these binary honeycomb lattices. The band gaps opened at the Dirac points due to the spin-orbital coupling (SOC) are several orders of magnitude larger than the graphene value. Such interesting properties also exist in their analogs of other group-IV elements, such as g-GeC3, g-Ge3C, g-GeSi3, and g-Ge3Si. The TI states predicted in these unique lattices broaden the application field of group-IV binary materials and open the door to searching for 2D TIs with enhanced SOC.

ABSTRACT: "We propose a pseudospin-field-dependent waveguide (PFDW) by constructing a sandwiched heterostructure consisting of three magneto-optical photonic crystals (MOPCs) with different geometric parameters. The upper expanded MOPC applied with an external magnetic field has broken time-reversal symmetry (TRS) and an analogous quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect, while the middle standard and the lower compressed ones are not magnetized and trivial. Attributed to the TRS-broken-QSH effect of the upper MOPC, the topological large-area one-way transmission that uniformly distributes over the middle domain is achieved and exhibits the characteristics of a pseudospin-field-momentum-locking  i.e., pseudospin-down (or pseudospin-up) leftward (or rightward) waveguide state when the positive (or negative) magnetic field is applied on the upper MOPC. We further demonstrate the strong robustness of the PFDW against backscattering from various kinds of defects. In addition, a topological beam modulator that can compress or expand the light beam, and a large-area pseudospin beam splitter have been designed. These results have potential in various applications such as sensing, signal processing, and optical communications. & COPY  2023 Chinese Laser Press"

ABSTRACT: We propose a one-dimensional Floquet ladder that possesses two distinct topological transport channels with opposite directionality. The transport channels occur due to a Z(2) non-Hermitian Floquet topological phase that is protected by time-reversal symmetry. The signatures of this phase are two pairs of Kramers degenerate Floquet quasienergy bands that are separated by an imaginary gap. We discuss how the Floquet ladder can be implemented in a photonic waveguide lattice and show that the direction of transport in the resulting waveguide structure can be externally controlled by focusing two light beams into adjacent waveguides. The relative phase between the two light beams selects which of the two transport channels is predominantly populated, while the angles of incidence of the two light beams determine which of the transport channels is suppressed by non-Hermitian losses. We identify the optimal lattice parameters for the external control of transport and demonstrate the robustness of this mechanism against disorder.

ABSTRACT: We develop a semiclassical theory of laser oscillation into a chiral edge state of a topological photonic system endowed with a frequency-dependent gain. As an archetypal model of this physics, we consider a Harper-Hofstadter lattice embedding population-inverted, two-level atoms as a gain material. We show that a suitable design of the spatial distribution of gain and its spectral shape provides flexible mode-selection mechanisms that can stabilize single-mode lasing into an edge state. Implications of our results for recent experiments are outlined.

ABSTRACT: When the feature size of photonic structures becomes comparable or even smaller than the wavelength of light, the fabrication imperfections inevitably introduce disorder that may eliminate many functionalities of subwavelength photonic devices. Here we suggest a novel concept to achieve a robust band gap which can endure disorder beyond 30% as a result of the transition from photonic crystals to Mie-resonant metamaterials. By utilizing Mie-resonant metamaterials with high refractive index, we demonstrate photonic waveguides and cavities with strong robustness to position disorder, thus providing a novel approach to the band-gap-based nanophotonic devices with new properties and functionalities.

ABSTRACT: Measuring the topological charge(TC) of optical vortices is of great importance in applications of vortex beams. A flexible and convenient method to determine the TC of an optical vortex is proposed by using an elliptical airy phase mask (EAPM). The mask can be embedded into a typical vortex generation setup, in which no additional optical elements are required. The number and the sign of TC are respectively obtained by analyzing the number and the direction of dark stripes in the far-field diffraction patterns of the vortex beam companied with EAPM. It is experimentally demonstrated that this method is able to measure TCs of both conventional and perfect vortex up to +/- 120.

ABSTRACT: Vortex beams offer significant potential for various applications in fields such as communication, quantum computing, and particle manipulation. Typically, these beams are generated by using laser light that passes through a passive phase modulation component. In recent years, there has been an increasing emphasis on miniaturizing and integrating the vortex beam light source, aimed at expanding the range of applications. Our study contributes to this goal by presenting a novel method for directly generating vector vortex beams from photonic crystal surface emitting lasers while preserving C-6 rotation symmetry. Our approach achieves topological charges of both +1 and -2, and we demonstrate the ability to dynamically switch between these orders by adjusting the injection conditions.

ABSTRACT: In this work, the nonlinear saturable absorption of topological insulator Bi2Te3 and application in solid-state pulsed laser have been investigated. The highly sensitive saturable absorption of few 2.0 W/cm(2) and stable Q-switching operation were investigated and achieved in a 1.0 mu m Nd: YVO4 laser as the threshold absorbed pump power was only 31 mW. This is the lowest in passively Q-switched solid-state lasers to the best of our knowledge. The Q-switched pulses as short as 97ns with an average power of 18.6 mW was demonstrated as pumped with 203mW. In addition, mode locking operation was observed. These results prove the potential of the Bi2Te3 sheets for efficiently producing high-energy short pulses in miniature and integrated laser system without the need for high excitation intensity.

ABSTRACT: Polarization topological charge (PTC) of a vector beam can be defined as the repetition number of polarization state change along the azimuthal axis, with its sign standing for the rotating direction of the polarization. In this paper, we present a design for PTC sorting of vector beams with polarization conjugated-phase component (PCC). The components, made of birefringent crystals, can induce conjugated spatial phase modulations for the orthogonal polarizations. Our simulations show, using a pair of PCC with specific design in a 4-f optical system, the system focuses vector beam modes on the locations representing the PTC of corresponding mode, and sorts PTC with separation efficiency as high as 77%. Our designs have the potential applications in modal characterization, communication, encryption, and so on.

ABSTRACT: In optical data transmission with using vortex laser beams, data can be encoded by the topological charge, which is theoretically unlimited. However, the topological charge of a single separate vortex is limited by possibilities of its generating. Therefore, in this work, we analyze light beams with an unbounded (countable) set of optical vortices. The summary topological charge of such beams is infinite. Phase singularities (isolated intensity nulls) in such beams typically have a unit topological charge and reside equidistantly (or not equidistantly) on a straight line in the beam cross section. Such beams are form-invariant and, on propagation in space, change only in scale and rotate. Orbital angular momentum of such multivortex beams is finite, since only a finite number of optical vortices fall into the area, where the Gaussian beam has a notable intensity. Other phase singularities are located in the periphery (and at the infinity), where the intensity is almost zero.

ABSTRACT: Topological matter exhibits exotic properties yet phases characterized by large topological invariants are difficult to implement, despite rapid experimental progress. A promising route toward higher topological invariants is via engineered Floquet systems, particularly in photonics, where flexible control holds the potential of extending the study of conventional topological matter to novel regimes. Here we implement a one-dimensional photonic quantum walk to explore large winding numbers. By introducing partial measurements and hence loss into the system, we detect winding numbers of three and four in multistep nonunitary quantum walks, which agree well with theoretical predictions. Moreover, by probing statistical moments of the walker, we identify locations of topological phase transitions in the system and reveal the breaking of pseudounitary near topological phase boundaries. As the winding numbers are associated with nonunitary time evolution, our investigation enriches understanding of topological phenomena in nonunitary settings.

ABSTRACT: The exotic electronic properties of topological semimetals (TSs) have opened new pathways for innovative photonic and optoelectronic devices, especially in the highly pursuit terahertz (THz) band. However, in most cases Dirac fermions lay far above or below the Fermi level, thus hindering their successful exploitation for the low-energy photonics. Here, low-energy type-II Dirac fermions in kitkaite (NiTeSe) for ultrasensitive THz detection through metal-topological semimetal-metal heterostructures are exploited. Furthermore, a heterostructure combining two Dirac materials, namely, graphene and NiTeSe, is implemented for a novel photodetector exhibiting a responsivity as high as 1.22 A W-1, with a response time of 0.6 mu s, a noise-equivalent power of 18 pW Hz(-0.5), with outstanding stability in the ambient conditions. This work brings to fruition of Dirac fermiology in THz technology, enabling self-powered, low-power, room-temperature, and ultrafast THz detection.

ABSTRACT: Integrating multiple functionalities into one single device is of great importance for ever-growing demand of photonic device. Optical vortex beam contains orbital angular momentum (OAM) and spin angular momentum (SAM) associated with phase and polarization singularities respectively, which has contributed to various application including optical manipulation, optical trapping and high-speed optical communication. Traditional methods to detect its phase and polarization mostly focus on the functionality of single dimensional optical field. However, quite different from the previous reports, we here propose a novel approach to measure the phase and polarization state based on the full use of near and far-field light functionalities in one single metadevice, which supports spin-controlled surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) and topological charge-dependent focus spot position. On the one hand, this design makes the most of multidimensional field optical scattering characteristics to rich the functions of metadevice. On the other hand, it provides a novel concept to recognize various angular momentum information of vortex beam. We believe that such design will have great potential for the integration of different sub-wavelength optical components.

ABSTRACT: Recently, many novel and exotic phases have been proposed by considering the role of topology in non-Hermitian systems, and their emergent properties are of wide current interest. In this work we propose the non-Hermitian generalization of semi-Dirac semimetals, which feature a linear dispersion along one momentum direction and a quadratic one along the other. We study the topological phase transitions in such two-dimensional semi-Dirac semimetals in the presence of a particle gain-and-loss term. We show that such a non-Hermitian term creates exceptional points (EPs) originating out of each semi-Dirac point. We map out the topological phase diagram of our model, using winding number and vorticity as topological invariants of the system. By means of numerical and analytical calculations, we examine the nature of edge states for different types of semi-Dirac models and establish bulk-boundary correspondence and absence of the non-Hermitian skin effect, in one class. On the other hand, for other classes of semi-Dirac models with asymmetric hopping, we restore the non-Hermitian skin effect, an anomalous feature usually present in non-Hermitian topological systems.

ABSTRACT: Aluminum-doped ZnO (AZO), a wide direct bandgap semiconductor which emits laser light in the ultraviolet range at room temperature, presents a promising optical gain material for creating lasers for applications in photonics, information storage, biology and medical therapeutics. AZO exhibits an excitonic photoluminescence peak in the ultraviolet region and a defect related photoluminescence peak in the visible region. In addition, a recently developed aluminum-doped ZnO nano-layered structure has a unique optical property namely that the dispersion of the dielectric constant exhibits an optical topological transition in the isofrequency surface from an ellipsoid to a hyperboloid. This unusual optical property provides a unique opportunity for creating nanoscale cavities with dimensions significantly smaller than the wavelength of light which could lead to potential applications such as efficient and compact ultraviolet lasers and LEDs. In this work, we investigate the photoluminescence properties of the anisotropic nano-layered aluminum-doped zinc oxide. In order to describe the influence of the aluminum dopants, a complete model for photoluminescence based on the set of rate equations for electron-hole recombination is developed. The set of coupled rate equations is solved numerically using the fourth order Runge Kutta technique for various optical pump intensities. Our calculations predict that the near-band-edge intensity increases with the addition of aluminum (aluminum filling factor up to similar to 3%) which indicates that the band gap energy increases as the aluminum content is increased.

ABSTRACT: Recently, the concepts of parity-time (PT) symmetry and band topology have inspired many novel ideas for light manipulation in their respective directions. Here we propose and demonstrate a perfect light absorber with a PT phase transition via coupled topological interface states (TISs), which combines the two concepts in a one-dimensional photonic crystal heterostructure. By fine tuning the coupling between TISs, the PT phase transition is revealed by the evolution of absorption spectra in both ideal and non-ideal PT symmetry cases. Especially, in the ideal case, a perfect light absorber at an exceptional point with unidirectional invisibility is numerically ob-tained. In the non-ideal case, a perfect light absorber in a broken phase is experimentally realized, which verifies the possibility of tailoring non-Hermiticity by engineering the coupling. Our work paves the way for novel effects and functional devices from the exceptional point of coupled TISs, such as a unidirectional light absorber and exceptional-point sensor.

ABSTRACT: We reported on the generation of the dual-wavelength rectangular pulse in an erbium-doped fiber laser (EDFL) with a topological insulator saturable absorber. The rectangular pulse could be stably initiated with pulse width from 13.62 to 25.16 ns and fundamental repetition rate of 3.54 MHz by properly adjusting the pump power and the polarization state. In addition, we verified that the pulse shape of the dual-wavelength rectangular pulse can be affected by the total net cavity dispersion in the fiber laser. Furthermore, by properly rotating the polarization controllers, the harmonic mode-locking operation of the dual-wavelength rectangular pulse was also obtained. The dual-wavelength rectangular pulse EDFL would benefit some potential applications, such as spectroscopy, biomedicine, and sensing research. (C) 2015 Chinese Laser Press

ABSTRACT: "We reported that the photonic crystal fiber (PCF) filled with TI:Bi2Te3 nanosheets solution could act as an effective saturable absorber (SA). Employing this TI-PCF SA device  we constructed an ytterbium-doped all-fiber laser oscillator and achieved the evanescent wave mode-locking operation. Due to the large cavity dispersion  the fundamental mode-locking pulse had the large full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 2.33 ns with the repetition rate of similar to 1.11 MHz  and the radio frequency (RF) spectrum with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 61 dB. In addition  the transition dynamics from a bunched state of pulses to harmonic mode-locking (HML) was also observed, which was up to 26th order."

ABSTRACT: To determine an effective optimization strategy and facilitate the manufacture of optical metalenses, this paper extends the material-field series-expansion (MFSE) method for the topology design of metalenses. A new anisotropic material-field function with a spatially anisotropic correlation is introduced to describe the structural topology in a narrow design domain. The topological features can be implicitly controlled by material-field correlation lengths in different directions. Then, a generalized sigmoid projection is introduced to construct an interpolation relationship between the unbounded material-field value and the relative permittivity. Based on the series expansion technique, the number of design variables is greatly reduced in this topology optimization process without requiring additional material-field bounded constraints. The MFSE-based metalens design problem is efficiently solved by using a gradient-based algorithm incorporating design sensitivity analysis. Numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed optimization algorithm can successfully obtain an optimized and easy-to-manufacture design in optics inverse design problems.

ABSTRACT: We present a discovery of an unusual unidirectionally rotating windmill scattering of electromagnetic waves by a magnetized gyromagnetic cylinder via an analytical theory for rigorous solution to fields and charges and an understanding of the underlying mathematical and physical mechanisms. Mathematically, the generation of nonzero off-diagonal components can break the symmetry of forward and backward scattering coefficients, producing unidirectional windmill scattering. Physically, this windmill scattering originates from the nonreciprocal unidirectional rotation of polarized magnetic charges on the surface of a magnetized gyromagnetic cylinder, which drives the scattering field to radiate outward in the radial direction and unidirectionally emit in the tangential direction. Interestingly, the unidirectional electromagnetic windmill scattering is insensitive to the excitation direction. Moreover, we also discuss the size dependence of unidirectional windmill scattering by calculating the scattering spectra of the gyromagnetic cylinder. These results are helpful for exploring and understanding novel interactions between electromagnetic waves and gyromagnetic materials or structures and offer deep insights for comprehending topological photonic states in gyromagnetic systems from the aspect of fundamental classical electrodynamics and electromagnetics.

ABSTRACT: The explosive success of graphene opens a new era of ultrathin 2D materials. It has been realized that the van der Waals layered materials with atomic and less atomic thickness can not only exist stably, but also exhibit unique and technically useful properties including small size effect, surface effect, macro quantum tunnel effect, and quantum effect. With the extensive research and revealing of the basic optical properties and new photophysical properties of 2D materials, a series of potential applications in optical devices have been continuously demonstrated and realized, which immediately roused an upsurge of study in the academic circle. Therefore, the application of 2D materials as broadband, efficient, convenient, and versatile saturable absorbers in ultrafast lasers is a potential and promising field. Herein, the main preparation methods of 2D materials are reviewed and technical guidelines for identifying and characterizing layered 2D materials are provided. After investigating the characteristics of 2D materials thoroughly in nonlinear optics, their performances in fiber lasers are comprehensively summarized according to the types of materials. Finally, some developmental challenges, potential prospects, and future research directions are summarized and presented for such promising materials.

ABSTRACT: We address the inhibition of tunneling in polariton condensates confined in a potential landscape created by a honeycomb array of microcavity pillars in the presence of spin-orbit coupling and Zeeman splitting in the external magnetic field. The coupling rate between the microcavity pillars can be strongly impacted even by weak out-of-phase temporal modulations of the depths of the corresponding potential wells. When such a modulation is implemented in truncated honeycomb arrays that realize a polariton topological insulator, which supports unidirectional edge states in the presence of spin-orbit coupling and Zeeman splitting, it allows controlling the velocity of the states. The origin of the phenomenon is the dynamical modulation with a proper frequency, which notably changes the dispersion of the system and the group velocity of edge states. We show that such a control is possible for modulation frequencies close to resonances for the inhibition of tunneling in a two-well configuration. Edge states considerably slow down, and even stop completely, when the modulation frequency approaches a resonant value, while above such a frequency, splitting of the edge states into wavepackets moving with different velocities occurs.

ABSTRACT: In the general case, upon free-space propagation of a paraxial optical vortex (OV) its topological charge (TC) is not conserved, unlike the orbital angular momentum (OAM), which remains unchanged. In this work, we discuss a Gaussian beam with fractional TC in the source plane, showing theoretically and numerically in which way the TC is changing (but remains integer) upon free-space propagation. There are four evolution scenarios for an original OV with fractional TC that depend on how close the original TC is to an integer even or odd number. If the TC in the initial plane has an arbitrary fractional value, it becomes an odd integer in the Fourier plane. If the initial TC is close to an odd integer number, then, on propagation, an OV with a TC of +1 is born in the Fresnel diffraction zone, while in the far field an OV with a TC of -1 appears. This optical vortex with a TC of -1 is located in the beam periphery where the intensity is almost zero and thus it is difficult to detect it experimentally. Additional vortices with a TC of +1 and -1 are generated in the beam with the initial fractional TC due to the interference between a linear source appearing in the area of phase jump and an ordinary optical vortex with an integer TC. An experiment on registering the optical vortices by using the interferograms matches the theory and simulation. For simple OVs (such as Laguerre-Gaussian or Bessel-Gaussian modes), TC is conserved both upon propagation and following weak phase distortions. When scattered from a random phase screen, the integer TC of an OV is experimentally shown to conserve until random path-difference distortion reaches a half wavelength. Because of this, under weak-turbulence conditions, it makes sense to measure a discretely changing TC, rather than measuring the continuously varying OAM.

ABSTRACT: Optical vortices (OV) are usually associated to cylindrically symmetric light beams. However, they can have more general geometries that extends their applicability. Since the typical experimental characterization methods are not appropriate for OV with arbitrary shapes, we discuss in this work how the definitions of the classical orbital angular momentum and the topological charge can be used to retrieve these informations in the general case. The concepts discussed are experimentally demonstrated and may be specially useful in areas such as optical tweezers and plasmonics. (C) 2014 Optical Society of America

ABSTRACT: The ideas of topology have found tremendous success in closed physical systems, but even richer properties exist in the more general open or dissipative framework. We theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate a bulk Fermi arc that develops from non-Hermitian radiative losses in an open system of photonic crystal slabs. Moreover, we discover half-integer topological charges in the polarization of far-field radiation around the bulk Fermi arc. Both phenomena are shown to be direct consequences of the non-Hermitian topological properties of exceptional points, where resonances coincide in their frequencies and linewidths. Our work connects the fields of topological photonics, non-Hermitian physics, and singular optics, providing a framework to explore more complex non-Hermitian topological systems.

ABSTRACT: This review summarizes recent developments of saturable absorbers (SAs) based on 2D materials for nonlinear optical absorption and ultrafast pulsed laser generation. Apart from graphene, various 2D materials such as topological insulators and transition metal dichalcogenides are investigated for SA applications and their important potential as passive mode-lockers for femtosecond laser production are extensively investigated. By selecting appropriate 2D materials, a wide spectral range of passively mode-locked pulsed lasers are obtained, covering visible, midinfrared and a terahertz region. A set of different approaches is used for fabricating SA modules of fiber laser photonics, which include sandwiching, side-polishing and tapering methods. Noticeably, through systematic studies, it is demonstrated that layer-stacking seldom deteriorates the SA performance of 2D materials in the evanescent regime, although their ultrathin nature may improve the efficiency in a transmission mode like sandwich-type SAs. The direction for designing new SAs is presented based on material characterization.

ABSTRACT: Hybrid materials taking advantage of the different physical properties of materials are highly attractive for numerous applications in today's science and technology. Here, it is demonstrated that epitaxial bi-domain III-V/Si are hybrid structures, composed of bulk photo-active semiconductors with 2D topological semi-metallic vertical inclusions, endowed with ambipolar properties. By combining structural, transport, and photoelectrochemical characterizations with first-principle calculations, it is shown that the bi-domain III-V/Si materials are able within the same layer to absorb light efficiently, separate laterally the photo-generated carriers, transfer them to semimetal singularities, and ease extraction of both electrons and holes vertically, leading to efficient carrier collection. Besides, the original topological properties of the 2D semi-metallic inclusions are also discussed. This comb-like heterostructure not only merges the superior optical properties of semiconductors with good transport properties of metallic materials, but also combines the high efficiency and tunability afforded by III-V inorganic bulk materials with the flexible management of nano-scale charge carriers usually offered by blends of organic materials. Physical properties of these novel hybrid heterostructures can be of great interest for energy harvesting, photonic, electronic or computing devices.

ABSTRACT: We reported diverse soliton operations in a thulium/holmium-doped fiber laser by taking advantage of a tapered fiber-based topological insulator (TI) Bi2Te3 saturable absorber (SA). The SA had a nonsaturable loss of similar to 53.5% and a modulation depth of 9.8%. Stable fundamentally mode-locked solitons at 1909.5 nm with distinct Kelly side-bands on the output spectrum, a pulse repetition rate of 21.5 MHz, and a measured pulse width of 1.26 ps were observed in the work. By increasing the pump power, both bunched solitons with soliton number up to 15 and harmonically mode-locked solitons with harmonic order up to 10 were obtained. To our knowledge, this is the first report of both bunched solitons and harmonically mode-locked solitons in a fiber laser at 2 mu m region incorporated with TIs. (C) 2015 Chinese Laser Press

ABSTRACT: The paper presents the design of sub-wavelength high-performing nonreciprocal optical devices using recently discovered magnetic Weyl semimetals. These passive bulk topological materials exhibit anomalous Hall effect which results in magneto-optical effects that are orders of magnitude higher than those in conventional materials, without the need of any external magnetic bias. Two optical isolators of both Faraday and Voigt geometries are designed. The isolators have dimensions that are reduced by three orders of magnitude compared to conventional magneto-optical configurations. The designed structures demonstrate that the magnetic Weyl semimetals may open up new avenues in photonics for the design of various nonreciprocal components.

ABSTRACT: Topological insulators are unique physical structures that are insulators in their bulk, but support currents at their edges which can be unidirectional and topologically protected from scattering on disorder and inhomogeneities. Photonic topological insulators can be crafted in materials that exhibit a strong nonlinear response, thus opening the door to the exploration of the interplay between nonlinearity and topological effects. Among the fascinating new phenomena arising from this interplay is the formation of topological edge solitons-hybrid asymmetric states localized across and along the interface due to different physical mechanisms. Such solitons have so far been studied only in materials with Kerr-type, or cubic, nonlinearity. Here, the first example of the topological edge soliton supported by parametric interactions in chi((2)) nonlinear media is presented. Such solitons exist in Floquet topological insulators realized in arrays of helical waveguides made of a phase-matchable chi((2)) material. Floquet edge solitons bifurcate from topological edge states in the spectrum of the fundamental frequency wave and remain localized over propagation distances drastically exceeding the helix period, while travelling along the edge of the structure. A theory of such states is developed. It is shown that multicolor solitons in a Floquet system exists in the vicinity of (formally infinite) set of linear resonances determined by the Floquet phase matching conditions. Away from resonance, soliton envelopes can be described by a period-averaged single nonlinear Schrodinger equation with an effective cubic nonlinear coefficient whose magnitude and sign depend on the overall phase-mismatch between the fundamental frequency and second harmonic waves. Such total phase-mismatch includes the intrinsic mismatch and the geometrically-induced mismatch introduced by the array, and its value reveals one of the genuine effects exhibited by the Floquet quadratic solitons. The results open fundamental new prospects for the exploration of a range of parametric frequency-mixing phenomena in photonic Floquet quadratic nonlinear media.

ABSTRACT: The valley contrasting physics in photonic systems gives rise to many interesting phenomena such as photonic valley Hall effect and robust valley transport. However, most reported valley photonic crystals are demonstrated in the honeycomb lattice. Here, unidirectional bulk modes and robust edge modes are numerically and experimentally shown in triangular photonic crystals. By switching the phase vortex of an input chiral source, dynamic unidirectional propagation of bulk modes at different valleys is observed. Unidirectional edge modes are also demonstrated on the domain wall between two distinct triangular photonic crystals. In addition, robust edge modes around sharp corners are experimentally confirmed. This work paves the way for the realization of dynamic unidirectional photonic transport and robust valley transport in photonic crystals.

ABSTRACT: Three-dimensional (3D) Dirac points inheriting relativistic effects from high-energy physics appear as gapless excitations in the topological band theory. Hosting fourfold linear dispersion, they play the central role among various topological phases, such as representing the degeneracy of paired Weyl nodes carrying opposite chiralities. While they have been extensively investigated in solid state systems for electrons, 3D Dirac points have not yet been observed in any classical systems. Here, we experimentally demonstrate 3D photonic Dirac points in the microwave region with an elaborately designed metamaterial, where two symmetrically placed Dirac points are stabilized by electromagnetic duality symmetry. Furthermore, spin-polarized surface arcs (counterparts of Fermi arcs in electronic systems) are demonstrated, which opens the gate toward implementing spin-multiplexed topological surface wave propagation. Closely linked to other exotic states through topological phase transitions, our system offers an effective medium platform for topological photonics.

ABSTRACT: The single-pass second-harmonic generation (SHG) of a vortex beam under low fundamental wave depletion is systematically studied. Vortex modes at 1064 nm with integer topological charges from +/- 1 to +/- 9 and fractional ones at +/- 0.75 are generated by modulating the fundamental Gaussian beam with different spiral phase plates. The frequency doubling of these fundamental vortex modes is realized via single-pass SHG through the KTP. A detailed theoretical model is set up in the single-pass SHG of the vortex beams. Theoretical analysis indicates that the higher the order of the vortex beams, the lower the SHG efficiency, when the beam waists and fundamental power are given. The experimentally measured SHG output characteristics verify those obtained via theoretical analysis. Conservation of the orbital angular momentum during the SHG process is also verified, regardless of the fractional or integer vortex beams. SH LG0,2l vortex beams with high mode purity are obtained. The beam waists of fundamental/SH in KTP measured using a 4f system demonstrate that the Rayleigh ranges of the fundamental wave and SH wave are the same. The paper comprehensively presents some basic laws in the single-pass SHG of a vortex beam. In addition, it also indicates that SHG is an effective method to improve the mode purity of vortex beam.

ABSTRACT: Chern insulators have been generalized to many classical wave systems and thereby lead to many potential applications such as robust waveguides, quantum computation and high-performance lasers. However, the band structure of a material can be either topologically trivial or non-trivial, depending on how the crystal structure is designed. Here, we propose a second Chern crystal in a four-dimensional parameter space by introducing two extra synthetic translation dimensions. Since the topology of the bulk bands in the synthetic translation space is intrinsically non-trivial, our proposed four-dimensional crystal is guaranteed to be topologically non-trivial regardless of the crystal's detailed configuration. We derive the topologically protected modes on the lower dimensional boundaries of such a crystal via dimension reduction. Remarkably, we observe the one-dimensional gapless dislocation modes and confirm their robustness in experiments. Our findings provide novel perspectives on topologically non-trivial crystals and may inspire designs of classical wave devices. Featuring with the gapless dislocation and corner modes, second Chern crystals with inherently nontrivial topology were demonstrated in the four-dimensional space with the introduction of synthetic translation dimension.

ABSTRACT: We report on an 800 nm femtosecond laser beam induced giant refractive index modulation and enhancement of near-infrared transparency in topological insulator material Bi2Te3 thin films. An ultrahigh refractive index of up to 5.9 was observed in the Bi2Te3 thin film in near-infrared frequency. The refractive index dramatically decreases by a factor of similar to 3 by an exposure to the 800 nm femtosecond laser beam. Simultaneously, the transmittance of the Bi2Te3 thin films markedly increases to similar to 96% in the near-infrared frequency. The Raman spectra provides strong evidences that the observed both refractive index modulation and transparency enhancement result from laser beam induced photooxidation effects in the Bi2Te3 thin films. The Bi2Te3 compound transfers into Bi2O3 and TeO2 under the laser beam illumination. These experimental results pave the way towards the design of various optical devices, such as near-infrared flat lenses, waveguide and holograms, based on topological insulator materials.

ABSTRACT: Nodal line semimetals (NLS) are three-dimensional (3D) crystals that support band crossings in the form of one-dimensional rings in the Brillouin zone. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling or lowered crystal symmetry, NLS may transform into Dirac semimetals, Weyl semimetals, or 3D topological insulators. In the photonics context, despite the realization of topological phases, such as Chern insulators, topological insulators, Weyl, and Dirac degeneracies, no experimental demonstration of photonic nodal lines (NLs) has been reported so far. Here, we experimentally demonstrate NL degeneracies in microwave cut-wire metacrystals with engineered negative bulk plasma dispersion. Both the bulk and surface states of the NL metamaterial are observed through spatial Fourier transformations of the scanned near-field distributions. Furthermore, we theoretically show that the NL degeneracy can transform into two Weyl points when gyroelectric materials are incorporated into the metacrystal design. Our findings may inspire further advances in topological photonics.

ABSTRACT: The applicability of photo-alignment technique to bent-core nematics (BCN) is demonstrated in this paper. In order to cope with the inherent problems of BCN such as high working temperature and large working current, a photo-alignment technique, based on two superimposed photosensitive layers of azo and reactive mesogen, is used to produce symmetric and asymmetric planar alignments. With various surface conditions, defect lines arrays are self-assembled and ac-driven electro-convection (EC) rolls are modulated. Further inspections indicate that the defect lines arrays and EC rolls are in a competitive state, which reveal that the EC rolls in BCN belong to nonstandard EC scenarios. By produdng defect lines and modulating EC rolls via photo-alignment technique, we could customize patterns in liquid crystals towards new photonic devices. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Large topological charge optical vortex beams carrying orbital angular momentum have potential applications on optical trapping, optical communication with high capacity, quantum information processing. However, the beam quality is degraded in vortex beams generated with spiral phase plates or resonator mirrors with defect spots and optical conversion efficiency in solid-state lasers is sacrificed by controlling the loss of resonator. It is a big challenge for generating high beam quality, high-order cylindrical vector beams with large topological charge in compact solid-state lasers. Here, high-order cylindrical vector beams [Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) modes with zero degree and order of l, LG(0,l)] with tunable topological charges up to 14 have been generated in an annular beam pumped Yb:YAG microchip laser by manipulating the pump power-dependent population inversion distribution. Efficient performance with optical efficiency of 17.5% has been achieved. The output power is 1.36 W for a vector-vortex laser with 14 topological charges. The pump power dependent wavelength tunable and dual-wavelength laser oscillation in vector-vortex beams has been observed by controlling the reabsorption loss at 1030 nm. Wavelength tunable, dual-wavelength (1030 and 1050 nm) laser oscillation has been achieved for vector-vortex beams with topological charges of 8, 9, and 10. The laser beam quality factor M-2 close to the theoretical value (l + 1) has been achieved for LG(0,l) vector-vortex beams with tunable topological charges up to 14. This work provides a new effective method for generating large topological charge high-order cylindrical vector beams in solid-state microchip lasers with high efficiency and high beam quality.

ABSTRACT: Vortex beams with fractional topological charge (FTC) have many special characteristics and novel applications. However, one of the obstacles for their application is the difficulty of precisely determining the FTC of fractional vortex beams. We find that when a vortex beam with an FTC illuminates a dynamic angular double slit ( ADS), the far-field interference patterns that include the information of the FTC of the beam at the angular bisector direction of the ADS vary periodically. Based on this property, a simple dynamic ADS device and data fitting method can be used to precisely measure the FTC of a vortex light beam with an error of less than 5%.

ABSTRACT: Light beam with helical wavefront carries welldefined orbital angular momentum (OAM) specified by its topological charge (TC). The off-axis self-interference of laterally displaced vortex beams results into interferogram consisting of pair of fork-like structures. In this study, it has been demonstrated that the interferogram consisting of conjoined fork-like structures allow simpler and unambiguous way of determining the sign and magnitude of TC carried by incoming vortex beam using interferogram analysis method. The method uses a Mach-Zehnder interferometer to introduce lateral displacement and tilt angles between the interfering beams.

ABSTRACT: We study the bulk-edge correspondence in topological photonic crystals with open boundary. If boundary is open, edge states become leaky inside the light cone, but still exhibit a chiral and gapless property taking into account the blurring of their band structure due to the leakage. The so-called bulk-edge correspondence is thus verified. On the other hand, in closed boundaries, edge states exhibit the well-defined band structure without the blurring and show clearly the bulk-edge correspondence. To demonstrate these results, we employ the transfer-matrix formalism and derive reflection matrices of semi-infinite systems. Optical density of states for the system with open boundaries is available via the Krein-Friedel-Lloyd formula for the reflection matrices. The leaky photonic band structure of the edge states is obtained by following the peaks and widths of the density of states as a function of momentum parallel to the boundary. Our derivation of the leaky band structure does not rely on possible effective non-hermitian hamiltonians but relies on a first-principles calculation of the Maxwell equation.

ABSTRACT: Topological theory of multipole moments in condensed matter physics have recently been generalized to classical systems such as photonic and sonic crystals and several types of quadrupole topological photonic crystals (QTPCs) have already been investigated. However, preceding reports relevant to this issue dealt mainly with square lattice. In this work, we reveal that quadrupole topological phases can also be appeared in hexagonal photonic lattices with the C3v-crystalline symmetry. For this purpose, we extend the topological theory of bulk and Wannier-sector polarizations to the affine coordinate system for analyzing the topological characteristics of non-square lattice systems. The calculation results show that the hexagonal photonic crystals with C3-crystalline symmetry have the quadrupole moments quantized to 1/3, provided that all photonic bands below the gap in consideration are non-degenerate. The hexagonal QTPCs support topological edge and corner states, which are much stronger confined compared with the edge and corner modes originating from nontrivial bulk polarizations. The presented results have fundamental importance and pave the way towards the broader applications of higher-order photonic topological insulators.

ABSTRACT: Dielectric metasurfaces have become efficient tools for creating ultrathin optical components with various functionalities for imaging, holography, quantum optics, and topological photonics. While static all-dielectric resonant metaphotonics is reaching maturity, challenges remain in the design and fabrication of efficient reconfigurable and tunable metasurface structures. A promising pathway toward tunable metasurfaces is by incorporating phase-transition materials into the photonic structure design. Here we demonstrate Mie-resonant silicon-based metasurfaces tunable via the insulator-to-metal transition of a thin VO2 layer with reversible properties at telecom wavelengths. We experimentally demonstrate two regimes of functional tunability driven by the VO2 transition: (i) 2 orders of magnitude modulation of the metasurface transmission, (ii) spectral tuning of near-perfect absorption. Both functionalities are accompanied by a hysteresis-like behavior that can be exploited for versatile memory effects. Beyond this demonstration of multifunctional properties, this work provides a general framework to efficiently use the full complex refractive index tuning of VO2, for both its refractive index modulation and optical absorption tuning. Tunable dielectric metasurfaces may find their applications in various photonics technologies including optical communications, information storage, imaging, detectors, and sensors.

ABSTRACT: In optical data transmission with using vortex laser beams, data can be encoded by the topological charge, which is theoretically unlimited. However, the topological charge of a single separate vortex (screw dislocation) is limited by possibilities of its generating. Therefore, we investigate here three examples of multivortex Gaussian light fields (two beams are form-invariant and one beam is astigmatic) with an unbounded (countable) set of screw dislocations. As a result, such fields have an infinite topological charge. The first beam has the complex amplitude of the Gaussian beam, but multiplied by the cosine function with a squared vortex argument. Phase singularity points of such a beam reside in the waist plane on the Cartesian axes and their density grows with increasing distance from the optical axis. The transverse intensity distribution of such a beam has a shape of a four-pointed star. All the optical vortices in this beam has the same topological charge of +1. The second beam also has the complex amplitude of the Gaussian beam, multiplied by the vortex-argument cosine function, but the cosine is raised to an arbitrary power. This beam has a countable number of the optical vortices, which reside in the waist plane uniformly on one Cartesian axis and the topological charge of each vortex equals to power, to which the cosine function is raised. The transverse intensity distribution of such beam consists of two light spots residing on a straight line, orthogonal to a straight line with the optical vortices. Finally, the third beam is similar to the first one in many properties, but it is generated with a tilted cylindrical lens from a 1D parabolic-argument cosine grating.

ABSTRACT: Due to the ultralow saturation properties of the topological insulator (TI), stable and high-power TI-based solid state has become an important issue. In this paper, using a folding V-shaped laser cavity to minimize the residual pump to the broadband saturable absorber, passive Q-switched operations with high power not only at 1.06 mu m but at 1.34 mu m as well were demonstrated. The 1.06-mu m laser of 150 mW and the corresponding repetition rate and a pulse duration of 28.57 kHz and 576 ns, respectively, were performed. The pulse energy of 5.24 mu J and the corresponding peak power of over 9 W were also estimated. Additionally, the laser at 1.3-mu m exhibited a passive Q-switched operation with an average power of as high as 326 mW and a pulse duration of 673 ns. A tunable repetition rate of 75.5 to 116.6 kHz, a pulse energy of 2.8 mu J, and the corresponding peak power of 4.2 W were obtained. In addition, the stability of Q-switched pulses was analyzed. The results experimentally extend the promising application of the 2-D material, i.e., exfoliated TI Bi2Te3, in solid-state lasers.

ABSTRACT: We calculate the topological charge (TC) of a coherent axial superposition of different-color Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beams, each having a different wavelength and TC. It is found that the TC of such a superposition is equal to the TC of the longer-wavelength constituent LG beam regardless of the weight coefficient of this beam in the superposition and its corresponding TC. It is interesting that the instantaneous TC of such a superposition is conserved and the (time-averaged) intensity distribution of the colored optical vortex changes its light gamut: whereas in the near field with increasing radius, colors of the light rings (rainbow) change according to their TC in the superposition from the smaller TC to the larger one, upon free-space propagation (to the far field), with increasing radius, the ring colors in the rainbow get arranged in the reverse order from the larger TC to the smaller one. It is also shown that choosing the wavelengths (blue, green, and red)in a special way in a three-color superposition of single-ringed LG beams allows obtaining a time-averaged white light ring at a certain distance.

ABSTRACT: This paper reports the experimental realization of efficiently sorting vector beams by polarization topological charge (PTC). The PTC of a vector beam can be defined as the repetition number of polarization state change along the azimuthal axis, while its sign stands for the rotating direction of the polarization. Here, a couple of liquid crystal Pancharatnam-Berry optical elements (PBOEs) have been used to introduce conjugated spatial phase modulations for two orthogonal circular polarization states. Applying these PBOEs in a 4-f optical system, our experiments show the setup can work for PTC sorting with a separation efficiency of more than 58%. This work provides an effective way to decode information from different PTCs, which may be interesting in many fields, especially in optical communication. (c) 2018 Chinese Laser Press

ABSTRACT: This study reports a modified Haldane model that supports transitions between valley and Chern topological phases in photonic crystals. Berry curvatures of this system can be flexibly diffused, converged, or flipped by endowing different model parameters, thus exhibiting exotic topological interface/edge behaviors, such as topological bound states with ideally zero dispersion. Importantly, the coexistence of chiral and antichiral edge states preserved simultaneously by valley and Chern topological phases is achieved by splicing together two kinds of topological structures as an entirety. It further employs a honeycomb lattice comprising gyromagnetic and ceramic cylinders at microwave frequencies, where inversion and time-reversal symmetries can be flexibly manipulated. Topological interface transport is demonstrated, including two opposite signs of group velocities jointly protected by topologically distinct regimes. These results bridge the gap between valley and Chern topological physics and shed light on developing reconfigurable integrated device applications for classical (quantum) information processing and photonic computing. The coexistence of chiral and antichiral edge states is proposed for photonic crystals by a modified Haldane model. Berry curvatures of this system can be flexibly diffused, converged, or flipped by endowing different parameters, exhibiting exotic topological interface/edge behaviors, such as topological bound states with ideally zero dispersion. This demonstrates promising applications in information processing and photonic computing.image

ABSTRACT: We have demonstrated the passive Q-switching mode-locking operation in an erbium-doped fiber (EDF) laser by using topological insulator Bi2Se3 deposited on fiber taper, whose damage threshold can be further increased by the large evanescent field interacting length. Due to the low saturation intensity, stable Q-switched mode-locked fiber lasers centered at 1562 nm can be generated at a pump power of 10 mW. The temporal and spectral characteristics for different pump strengths have also been investigated. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time a Q-switched mode-locked EDF laser based on the fiber taper deposited by Bi2Se3 was generated. (C) 2014 Optical Society of America

ABSTRACT: Optical vortices, the spatial modes of an electromagnetic wave carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM), have attracted increasing interest because of their potential for applications in optical communication with enhanced security and channel capacity. A unique optical vortex (OV) generation method has been recently proposed based on the Pancharatnam-Berry (PB) phase induced by the winding topology of polarization around a vortex singularity at bound states in the continuum (BIC). Compared with the recently emergent metasurface-based OV generators, which rely on spatial variations, the BIC-based OV generators have yielded advances in terms of design feasibility, fabrication complexity, and robustness. However, their applications in practical photonic systems are currently limited because OV generations from BIC-related devices originate from the topological property of the photonic bands and cannot be dynamically altered. Here, by leveraging the vortex topology in momentum space together with the nonlinear dynamics of silicon, we demonstrate that a silicon photonic crystal slab can realize optically switchable OV generation. In particular, the spatial tunability and the switching effects in the picosecond scale are studied using nonlinear modeling at near-infrared wavelengths. The demonstrated nontrivial topological nature of the active generators can expand the application of BIC-based devices to include ultrafast vortex beam generation, high-capacity optical communication, and mode-division multiplexing.

ABSTRACT: Near-field microscopy discloses a peculiar potential to explore novel quantum state of matter at the nanoscale, providing an intriguing playground to investigate, locally, carrier dynamics or propagation of photoexcited modes as plasmons, phonons, plasmon-polaritons or phonon-polaritons. Here, we exploit a combination of hyperspectral time domain spectroscopy nano-imaging and detectorless scattering near-field optical microscopy, at multiple terahertz frequencies, to explore the rich physics of layered topological insulators as Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te2.2Se0.8, hyperbolic materials with topologically protected surface states. By mapping the near-field scattering signal from a set of thin flakes of Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te2.2Se0.8 of various thicknesses, we shed light on the nature of the collective modes dominating their optical response in the 2-3 THz range. We capture snapshots of the activation of transverse and longitudinal optical phonons and reveal the propagation of sub-diffractional hyperbolic phonon-polariton modes influenced by the Dirac plasmons arising from the topological surface states and of bulk plasmons, prospecting new research directions in plasmonics, tailored nanophotonics, spintronics and quantum technologies. Propagation of photoexcited modes provides important information for novel quantum state. Here, the authors reveal the propagation of sub-diffractional hyperbolic phonon-polariton modes influenced by the Dirac plasmons in topological insulators.

ABSTRACT: The phase angle of the vortex beam along a closed loop centered on the optical singularity changes by 2 pi l, where l is the number of phase jumps (PJs) from 0 to 2 pi and indicates the topological charge of the vortex beam. In this paper, the generation and specification of a new type of vortex beam, in which their PJs are asymmetrically embedded in the phase pattern, are reported. In contrast to Laguerre-Gaussian vortex beams, where PJs are equally spaced azimuthally around the optical singularity, the presented vortex beams have PJs embedded at arbitrary azimuthal angles. By designing a particular forked grating and displaying it on a spatial light modulator, this type of vortex beam is experimentally generated. As with conventional forked grating, the designed grating produces vortex beams with the opposite orbital angular momentum (OAM) sign in the first diffraction order. By measuring the relative orientation of the intensity profile of these OAM beams in the first diffraction order, the position of the PJs on the wavefront of a vortex beam with l = 2 can be determined. This type of vortex beam could have potential applications in various fields of photonics, especially in optical communications based on optical vortices.

ABSTRACT: "The development of metasurface, capable of controlling wave-fronts through interfacial phase discontinuity, offers a fascinating methodology for designing two dimensional miniaturized optical devices. Owing to an additional advantage of the enhanced useful transmission via Bainet-inverted matasurface, we exploit them to demonstrate an intriguing concept of merging the phase-profiles of two distinct optical devices, a lens and a spiral phase plate, to realize an ultrathin nanostructured optical vortex lens. The proposed device can has multiple focal planes along the longitudinal direction  whereas the number of focal plans, corresponding topological charges and focal lengths can readily be tailored to meet any desired requirements. Meanwhile, the dual-polarity feature of the optical vertex metalens exhibits spin controlled real and virtual focal plans, while dispersionless aptitude of nanobars enables its working over the broadband. The concept unveils a novel way of employing metasurface, to engraft the phase profiles of multiple bulk devices, to achieve unique functionalities for promising applications in integrated photonics."

ABSTRACT: Squeezed light is a critical resource in quantum sensing and information processing. Due to the inherently weak optical nonlinearity and limited interaction volume, considerable pump power is typically needed to obtain efficient interactions to generate squeezed light in bulk crystals. Integrated photonics offers an elegant way to increase the nonlinearity by confining light strictly inside the waveguide. For the construction of large-scale quantum systems performing many-photon operations, it is essential to integrate various functional modules on a chip. However, fabrication imperfections and transmission cross talk may add unwanted diffraction and coupling to other photonic elements, reducing the quality of squeezing. Here, by introducing the topological phase, we experimentally demonstrate the topologically protected nonlinear process of four-wave mixing, enabling the generation of squeezed light on a silica chip. We measure the cross-correlations at different evolution distances for various topological sites and verify the nonclassical features with high fidelity. The squeezing parameters are measured to certify the protection of cavity-free, strongly squeezed states. The demonstration of topological protection for squeezed light on a chip brings new opportunities for quantum integrated photonics, opening novel approaches for the design of advanced multi-photon circuits.

ABSTRACT: The recent development in topological photonics has revealed a variety of exotic phenomena such as Weyl degeneracy. However, a Weyl nodal surface, a two-dimensional topological degeneracy, has not been reported in Hermitian photonics. In this paper, topologically nontrivial photonic nodal surface in a helix structure possessing twofold screw symmetry and time-reversal symmetry is demonstrated. In contrast to nodal surfaces in other wave systems in which topological phase depends on the system parameters such as coupling strength, nontrivial topological properties of nodal surface in our work are guaranteed by effective photonic properties. Calculated Chern number, Berry curvature, and photonic Fermi arcs support the existence of nontrivial topological phase of the nodal surface. This work suggests the possibilities of many intriguing photonic topological features with nonzero dimensions.

ABSTRACT: Dynamics of polarization optical singularities chain reactions in generic elliptically polarized speckle fields created in photorefractive crystal LiNbO3 was investigated in details Induced speckle field develops in the tens of minutes scale due to photorefractive 'optical damage effect' induced by incident beam of He-Ne laser. It was shown that polarization singularities develop through topological chain reactions of developing speckle fields driven by photorefractive nonlinearities induced by incident laser beam. All optical singularities (C points, optical vortices, optical diabolos,) are defined by instantaneous topological structure of the output wavefront and are tangled by singular optics lows. Therefore, they have develop in tangled way by six topological chain reactions driven by nonlinear processes in used nonlinear medium (photorefractive LiNbO3: Fe in our case): C-points and optical diabolos for right (left) polarized components domains with orthogonally left (right) polarized optical vortices underlying them. All elements of chain reactions consist from loop and chain links when nucleated singularities annihilated directly or with alien singularities in 1: 9 ratio. The topological reason of statistics was established by low probability of far enough separation of born singularities pair from existing neighbor singularities during loop trajectories. Topology of developing speckle field was measured and analyzed by dynamic stokes polarimetry with few seconds' resolution. The hierarchy of singularities govern scenario of tangled chain reactions was defined. The useful space-time data about peculiarities of optical damage evolution were obtained from existence and parameters of 'islands of stability' in developing speckle fields.

ABSTRACT: The emergence of Dirac semimetals has stimulated growing attention, owing to the considerable technological potential arising from their peculiar exotic quantum transport related to their nontrivial topological states. Especially, materials showing type-II Dirac fermions afford novel device functionalities enabled by anisotropic optical and magnetotransport properties. Nevertheless, real technological implementation has remained elusive so far. Definitely, in most Dirac semimetals, the Dirac point lies deep below the Fermi level, limiting technological exploitation. Here, it is shown that kitkaite (NiTeSe) represents an ideal platform for type-II Dirac fermiology based on spin-resolved angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory. Precisely, the existence of type-II bulk Dirac fermions is discovered in NiTeSe around the Fermi level and the presence of topological surface states with strong (approximate to 50%) spin polarization. By means of surface-science experiments in near-ambient pressure conditions, chemical inertness towards ambient gases (oxygen and water) is also demonstrated. Correspondingly, NiTeSe-based devices without encapsulation afford long-term efficiency, as demonstrated by the direct implementation of a NiTeSe-based microwave receiver with a room-temperature photocurrent of 2.8 mu A at 28 GHz and more than two orders of magnitude linear dynamic range. The findings are essential to bringing to fruition type-II Dirac fermions in photonics, spintronics, and optoelectronics.

ABSTRACT: Nonreciprocity and asymmetric transmission in optical and plasmonic systems is a key element for engineering the one-way propagation structures for light manipulation. Here we investigate topological nanostructures covered with graphene-based meta-surfaces, which consist of a periodic pattern of subwavelength stripes of graphene winding around the (meta-) tube or (meta-)torus. We establish the relation between the topological and plasmonic properties in these structures, as justified by simple theoretical expressions. Our results demonstrate how to use strong asymmetric and chiral plasmonic responses to tailor the electrodynamic properties in topological meta-structures. Cavity resonances formed by elliptical and hyperbolic plasmons in meta-structures are sensitive to the one-way propagation regime in a finite length (Fabry-Perot-like) meta-tube and display the giant mode splitting in a (Mach-Zehnder-like) meta-torus.

ABSTRACT: Although lots of research works have devoted to the generation of cylindrical vector vortex (CVV) beam, little attention has been paid to the detection work. Here, we have experimentally demonstrated a novel detection method to measure the helical topological charge of CVV beams at the working wavelength of 1550nm. The polarization order of CVV beams was firstly measured by using a polarizer. And the topological charge of RHC and LHC were measured by interfering with the plane wave. Then the topological charges of CVV beams were successfully calculated. Experimental results match well with the theoretical prediction and this might provides an efficient measurement technique for detecting the spiral phase of CVV beams.

ABSTRACT: Historically, nanophotonics deals with a control of light at the nanoscale being closely connected with the rapid advances in plasmonics - the physics of surface plasmon polaritons supported by metal-dielectric interfaces. Properly engineered nanostructures allow the subwavelength propagation of light and its strong confinement in nanowaveguides and nanocavities, making possible the field enhancement and lasing. Spaser was suggested as a special type of nanolaser with a very small footprint that can be modulated quickly thus becoming a good candidate for on chip optical data processing. However, recent developments in the physics of high-index dielectric nanoparticles and resonant dielectric metasurfaces allowed to advance the field of nanophotonics and introduce novel nonplasmonic nano structures and nanolasers empowered by topology and interference effects. Here we present first some examples of experimentally realized spasers, and then discuss the recent developments in the cutting-edge high-index dielectric nanostructures employed for nonplasmonic nanolasers based on Mie resonances, anapole states, bound states in the continuum, and the physics of topological phases.

ABSTRACT: Broadband detection of mid-infrared (IR) photons extends to advanced optoelectronic applications such as imaging, sensing, and telecommunications. While graphene offers an attractive platform for broadband visible/IR photodetection, previous efforts to improve its responsivity, for example, by integrating light-absorbing colloids or waveguide or antenna fabrication, were achieved at the cost of reduced photon detection bandwidth. In this work, we demonstrate room-temperature operation of a novel mid-IR photodetector based on a graphene-Bi2Se3 heterostructure showing broadband detection and high responsivity (1.97 and 8.18 A/W at mid-and near-IR, respectively), in which simultaneous improvement of the spectral range and responsivity is achieved via exploiting broadband absorption of mid-1R and IR photons in a small-band-gap Bi2Se3 topological insulator and efficient hot carrier separation and strong photogating across the Bi2Se3/graphene interface. With sufficient room for further improvement by interface engineering, our results show a promising route to realize ultrabroadband, high-responsivity hot-carrier optoelectronics at room temperature.

ABSTRACT: "Liquid crystals hosting nanoparticles comprise a fascinating research field, ranging from fundamental aspects of phase transitions to applications in optics and photonics. Liquid-crystalline phases exhibit topological defects that can be used for assembly of nanoparticles in periodical arrays, and at the same time, the nanoparticles can increase the stability range of liquid-crystalline phases. This has been experimentally demonstrated over the past few years in the case of blue phases that are present in some strongly chiral liquid crystals. Experimental results in quantum dot-driven blue phase stabilization are presented here by means of high-resolution calorimetry and polarizing optical microscopy. It is demonstrated that quantum dots essentially stabilize the macroscopically amorphous blue phase III. There are discussed similarities and differences between the effects of spherical and anisotropic nanoparticles on blue phase stabilization  moreover, future prospects and trends in the field are addressed."

ABSTRACT: In this paper, we propose a unidirectional wave guide based on valley Hall effect, which is composed of two kinds of photonic crystals with different topological properties. These two kinds of photonic crystals arc composed of Al-70 Ga-30, As and Si dielectric cylinders, which can realize the unidirectional passage of light in the communication band. The simulation results show that the proposed structure can not only realize the large angle turn of the optical path, but also has good tolerance to defects, which provides a reference for the design of new optical waveguides with efficient optical transmission characteristics.

ABSTRACT: A method to detect of the topological charges (TCs) for vortex beams by using gradually changing-period spiral spoke grating (GCPSSG) is designed and experimentally demonstrated. The value of TC can be measured due to the fact that the diffraction spot will appear a bright high intensity when the TC is equal to the diffractive grating spoke number, and otherwise the central intensity remains doughnut-like structure. Meanwhile, the rotated direction of the twist fringes is opposite with the grating, therefore the sign of TC can be distinguished. Moreover, in addition to discussing the light beam illuminates the geometric center of the grating, the beam misalignment condition is also considered. In this case, the magnitude and sign of TC can be simultaneously determined by the number and orientation of the bright spots, respectively. The detection of TCs up to 160 is realized with this scheme. The experimental results indicate that this scheme is robust and effective because the GCPSSG shows good tolerance to environment vibration and beam misalignment for the TC diagnostics, which is anticipated to be useful for optical communication.

ABSTRACT: Non-Hermiticity may significantly influence the topology of a photonic/electronic lattice, giving rise to point gaps, which have attracted much attention in recent years. While the influences of the point-gap topology on the bulk-boundary correspondence for the line gap have been widely studied, the topological lattice that simultaneously processes the line-gap and point-gap topological transitions has not been reported. Here, a strategy to simultaneously manipulate the line-gap and point-gap topologies in non-Hermitian lattices is proposed. By introducing the asymmetric intercell coupling, the line-gap topological transition process is demonstrated. By further considering the nonreciprocal coupling between the nearest neighboring unit cells, the point-gap and line-gap topological transitions can be simultaneously realized. Finally, the influence of the next nearest coupling on non-Hermitian line-gap and point-gap topologies is also discussed.

ABSTRACT: "We consider the effect of time-periodic forcing on a one-dimensional Schro\dinger equation with a topologically protected defect (edge) mode. The unforced system models a domain wall or dislocation defect in a periodic structure, and it supports a defect mode which bifurcates from the Dirac point (linear band crossing) of the underlying bulk medium. We study the robustness of this state against time-periodic forcing of the type that arises in the study of Floquet topological insulators in condensed matter, photonics, and cold-atoms systems. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that under time-periodic forcing of sufficiently high frequency, the defect state undergoes radiative leakage of its energy away from the interface into the bulk  the time-decay is exponential on a time scale proportional to the inverse square of the forcing amplitude. The envelope dynamics of our Floquet system are approximately governed, on long time scales, by an effective (homogenized) periodically forced Dirac equation. Multiple scale analysis of the effective envelope dynamics yields an expansion of the radiating solution, which shows excellent agreement with our numerical simulations."

ABSTRACT: We consider the process of conversion between linear polarizations as light is reflected from a photonic crystal slab. We observe that, over a wide range of frequencies, complete polarization conversion can be found at isolated wave vectors. Moreover, such an effect is topological: the complex reflection coefficients have a nonzero winding number in the wave vector space. We also show that bound states in continuum in this system have their wave vectors lying on the critical coupling curve that defines the condition for complete polarization conversion. Our work points to the use of topological photonics concepts for the control of polarization, and suggests the exploration of topological properties of scattering matrices as a route towards creating robust optical devices.

ABSTRACT: We construct optical beams in free space with robust skyrmionic structures in their polarization fields, both in the electric spin vector for near-circular fields and in the polarization direction for near-linear fields, and for both Bloch (spiral) and Neel (hedgehog) textures. These structures are made possible by the spin-orbit coupling of tightly-focused nonparaxial optics as applied to higher-order Full-Poincare beams, as well as by standing-wave configurations comprising forwards- and backwards-propagating waves. Our constructions show near-uniform circular and linear polarizations, providing a high degree of topological protection in the absence of nonlinear interactions.

ABSTRACT: We present a formal demonstration that light can simultaneously exhibit a superfluid behavior and spatial long-range order when propagating in a photonic crystal with self-focusing nonlinearity. In this way, light presents the distinguishing features of matter in a supersolid phase. We show that this supersolid phase provides the stability conditions for nonlinear Bloch waves and, at the same time, permits the existence of topological solitons or defects for the envelope of these waves. We use a condensed matter analysis instead of a standard nonlinear optics approach and provide numerical evidence of these theoretical findings.

ABSTRACT: Topology manifesting in many branches of physics deepens our understanding on state of matters. Topological photonics has recently become a rapidly growing field since artificial photonic structures can be well designed and constructed to support topological states, especially a promising large-scale implementation of these states using photonic chips. Meanwhile, due to the inapplicability of Hall conductance to photons, it is still an elusive problem to directly measure the integer topological invariants and topological phase transitions in photonic system. Here, we present a direct observation of topological winding numbers by using bulk-state photon dynamics on a chip. Furthermore, we for the first time experimentally observe the topological phase transition points via single-photon dynamics. The integrated topological structures, direct measurement in the single-photon regime and strong robustness against disorder add the key elements into the toolbox of quantum topological photonics and may enable topologically protected quantum information processing in large scale.

ABSTRACT: Planar waveguides limit the transmission of electromagnetic waves in a specific direction and have a wide range of applications in filters, sensors, and energy-transfer devices. However, given the increasing demand for planar-integrated photonics, new waveguides are required with excellent characteristics such as more functionality, greater efficiency, and smaller size. Herein, the experimental results for a planar microwave-regime waveguide fabricated from circuit-based magnetic hyperbolic metamaterial (HMM) are reported. HMM is a special type of anisotropic metamaterial, whose isofrequency contour (IFC) takes the form of an open hyperboloid. Because of the open-dispersion IFCs, HMMs support propagating high-k modes with large effective refractive indices, which allow planar hyperbolic waveguides to be miniaturized. Especially, as opposed to the traditional dielectric slab waveguide, the group velocity and phase velocity in hyperbolic waveguides are oriented in opposite directions-a characteristic that is exploited to realize the backward propagation of electromagnetic waves. Based on this property, a backward coupler based on the hyperbolic waveguide is designed and experimented with. Herein, the significant potential of circuit-based platforms for the experimental study of the propagation and coupling of guided modes is not only revealed but also the use of HMMs for numerous integrated functional devices is promoted.

ABSTRACT: Recent rapid progress in subwavelength optics and nanophotonics with dielectric structures is underpinned by the physics of Mie resonances excited in nanoparticles with a high refractive index, and it suggests a novel platform for the localization of light in subwavelength photonic structures and opens new horizons for metamaterial-enabled photonics or metaphotonics. In this invited paper, we review the recent advances in Mie-resonant metaphotonics (also termed as Mie-tronics) for isolated high-index dielectric nanoparticles (or nanoantennas) and nanoparticle structures such as resonant dielectric metasurfaces, as well as their applications to topological photonics. We also oversee the future developments of this active field and its links to other research areas.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonic crystals (TPC) can effectively suppress the backscattering from defects and achieve unidirectional transmission with high forward transmittance, thus becoming a promising candidate in integrated photonic chip applications. Among different TPCs, the valley photonic crystals (VPCs) based on quantum valley Hall effect (QVHE) originating from valley-dependent spin-split bulk bands, can achieve spin-dependent unidirectional transmission at telecommunication wavelength with conventional dielectric material, such as silicon, which can be readily fabricated by current CMOS nanofabrication techniques. Therefore, VPCs recently attract broad attention. Generally, a large working bandwidth is preferred in optical communications and information processing, which should be as large as possible. Currently, the maximum working bandwidth of VPCs at telecommunication wavelength is limited to about 130 nm. Based on theoretical analysis and numerical simulation, a triangular lattice VPC composed of all-dielectric silicon-based triangular air holes is proposed, and the working bandwidth at 1550 nm is further extended to 229 nm. By combining two mirror-inversed VPCs, we observe the valley?spin locking behavior results in selective net spin flow inside bulk VPCs to achieve unidirectional transmission with a high forward transmittance up to 0.97. Moreover, the intensity distributions of the incident light show neglectable scattering loss at the sharp edge of the zigzag and ?????? shape waveguides, confirming the achievement of scattering immune propagation. The designed VPCs not only offer a possibility to expand the working bandwidth, but also can be applied to device applications in integrated photonics and information processing using spin-dependent transportation.

ABSTRACT: Weyl fermions have not been found in nature as elementary particles, but they emerge as nodal points in the band structure of electronic and classical wave crystals. Novel phenomena such as Fermi arcs and chiral anomaly have fueled the interest in these topological points which are frequently perceived as monopoles in momentum space. Here, we report the experimental observation of generalized optical Weyl points inside the parameter space of a photonic crystal with a specially designed four-layer unit cell. The reflection at the surface of a truncated photonic crystal exhibits phase vortexes due to the synthetic Weyl points, which in turn guarantees the existence of interface states between photonic crystals and any reflecting substrates. The reflection phase vortexes have been confirmed for the first time in our experiments, which serve as an experimental signature of the generalized Weyl points. The existence of these interface states is protected by the topological properties of the Weyl points, and the trajectories of these states in the parameter space resembles those of Weyl semimetal Fermi arc surface states in momentum space. Tracing the origin of interface states to the topological character of the parameter space paves the way for a rational design of strongly localized states with enhanced local field.

ABSTRACT: The light diffraction on fork-shaped binary phase holograms (BPHs) with quadratic azimuthal phase term is considered. The distribution of intensity and phase, including positions of singularities and their number on the value of the quadratic term is revealed and analyzed. A simple analytical expression for the total topological charge (TC) of optical vortices (OVs) is derived for arbitrary power of azimuthal phase dependence. In order to visualize the phase distributions and phase singularities, interference measurements are carried out. The results of analytical and numerical calculations are confirmed by experimental data. These results may provide new possibilities for optical trapping and manipulation.

ABSTRACT: Topological semimetals, representing a new topological phase that lacks a full band gap in bulk states and exhibiting nontrivial topological orders, recently have been extended to photonic systems, predominantly in photonic crystals and to a lesser extent metamaterials. Photonic crystal realizations of Dirac degeneracies are protected by various space symmetries, where Bloch modes span the spin and orbital subspaces. Here, we theoretically show that Dirac points can also be realized in effective media through the intrinsic degrees of freedom in electromagnetism under electromagnetic duality. A pair of spin-polarized Fermi-arc-like surface states is observed at the interface between air and the Dirac metamaterials. Furthermore, eigenreflection fields show the decoupling process from a Dirac point to two Weyl points. We also find the topological correlation between a Dirac point and vortex or vector beams in classical photonics. The experimental feasibility of our scheme is demonstrated by designing a realistic metamaterial structure. The theoretical proposal of the photonic Dirac point lays the foundation for unveiling the connection between intrinsic physics and global topology in electromagnetism.

ABSTRACT: Topological transitions in reciprocal space, widely existing in hyperbolic metasurfaces, have attracted significant attention due to their unprecedented capabilities to redirect surface plasmon polaritons, for example, anomalous wave propagation, negative refraction, non-diffraction transmission, etc. However, previous studies have mostly focused on electric hyperbolic metasurfaces, while magnetic configurations that enable magnetic light-matter interaction and the manipulation of magnetic surface waves have seldom been studied. Here, we theoretically and numerically study a terahertz magnetic topological transition metasurface consisting of the double-split ring resonator arrays, demonstrating that breaking the symmetry of the metal pattern is an efficient method to introduce Fano resonance and novel independent self-collimation frequency. Furthermore, we try to combine two different magnetic hyperbolic metasurfaces to manipulate the magnetic surface waves at the topological transition interface at will. The proposed integrated metasurface provides new degree of freedom for the control of magnetic plasmons and presents a great potential in the applications of plasmonic devices.

ABSTRACT: In this paper, we summarize a remarkable result obtained by Soskin et al. in Phys Rev A 56, 4064 (1997).We show that for an on-axis superposition of two different-waist Laguerre-Gauss beams with numbers (0, n) and (0, m), the topological charge equals TC=m up to a plane where the waist radii become the same, given that the beam (0, m) has a greater waist radius, changing to TC=n after this plane. This occurs because in the initial plane the superposition has an on-axis optical vortex with TC=m and on different axis-centered circles there are (n - m) vortices with TC= +1 and (n - m) vortices with TC= -1. On approaching the above-specified plane, the vortices with TC= -1 depart to infinity with a higher-than-light speed, with the TC of the total beam becoming equal to TC= n. If, on the contrary, the beam (0, m) has a smaller waist, then the total TC equals n on a path from the initial plane up to a plane where the waist radii become the same, changing to TC= m after the said plane. This occurs because after the said plane, n-m vortices with TC= -1 arrive from infinity with a higher-than-light speed.

ABSTRACT: In this paper, we reported a multiwavelength passively Q-switched Yb3+:GdAl3(BO3)(4) solid-state laser with topological insulator Bi2Te3 as a saturable absorber (SA) for the first time, to the best of our knowledge. Bi2Te3 nanosheets were prepared by the facile solvothermal method. The influence of three Bi2Te3 densities on the laser operation was compared. The maximum average output power was up to 57 mW with a pulse energy of 511.7 nJ. The shortest pulsewidth was measured to be 370 ns with 110 kHz pulse repetition rate and 40 mW average power. The laser operated at three wavelengths simultaneously at 1043.7, 1045.3, and 1046.2 nm, of which the frequency differences were within the terahertz wave band. Our work suggests that solvothermal synthesized Bi2Te3 is a promising SA for simultaneously multiwavelength laser operation. (C) 2015 Chinese Laser Press

ABSTRACT: Bismuth (Bi)-doped laser glasses with broadband emission are of current interest in the fields of sensing, bio-imaging, and photonics. For practical applications, it must be considered how to improve the emission efficiency, in particular, for borate glasses with wide glass-forming range, low melting point, and excellent fiberizing ability. Herein, we experimentally demonstrate that addition of GeO2 to aluminoborate glasses can effectively enhance Bi NIR emission by more than 300 times with prolonged decay time (similar to 500 s) and good homogeneity, which is, to our best knowledge, seldom achieved in Bi-doped borate multi-component glasses. The addition of second glass-former GeO2, as revealed by detailed optical and structural analysis, leads to the facile regulation on local glass structure, forcing the conversion of aluminum species from AlO5 and AlO6 to AlO4 and consequently pushes the conversion of Bi3+ to Bi+ and Bi-0 and stabilizes Bi NIR centers, which finally results in highly enhanced Bi NIR emission. We believe these results could contribute to designing Bi-activated multi-component laser glass and fibers with efficient NIR photoemission.

ABSTRACT: One of the fascinating topological phenomena is the edge state in one-dimensional system. In this work, the topological photonics in the dieter chains composed by the split ring resonators are revealed based on the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. The topologically protected photonic edge state is observed directly with the in situ measurements of the local density of states in the topological nontrivial chain. Moreover, we experimentally demonstrate that the edge state localized at both ends is robust against a varied of perturbations, such as losses and disorder. Our results not only provide a versatile platform to study the topological physics in photonics but also may have potential applications in the robust power transfer.

ABSTRACT: The location and transmission of light is the core of modern photonic integrated device, and the proposal of topological photonics provides a new way of implementing optical manipulation. Topological photonic structures based on the quantum spin hall effect or quantum valley hall effect have the properties of immunity to defects and suppress backscattering, so they play a key role in designing novel low-loss photonic devices. In this work, we design a two-dimensional dielectric photonic crystal with time-reversal symmetry to achieve the coexistence of the quantum spin hall effect and the quantum valley hall effect in a photonic crystal. The design can be likened to an electronic system in which two pairs of Kramers simplex pairs are constructed to achieve a quadruple simplex pair in a photonic crystal. First, based on the method of shrinking and expanding the silicon pillars arranged in the honeycomb structure, the quadruple degeneracy point at the G point of the first Brillouin zone is opened, and the corresponding topologically trivial or non-trivial photonic band gap is formed,thereby realizing quantum spin hall effect. The expanded honeycomb lattice evolves into a Kagome structure, and then positive and negative perturbations are added to the Kagome lattice, breaking the spatial inversion symmetry of the Photonic crystal. When mirror symmetry is broken, different chiral photonic crystals can be created,leading the degeneracy point of the non-equivalent valleys K and K' in the Brillouin zone to be opened and a complete band gap to appear, thus realizing the Quantum valley hall effect. In the common band gap, topologically protected edge states are induced by nontrivial valley Chern number at the interface between two photonic crystals with opposite chirality. The numerical calculations show that unidirectional transport and bending -immune topological boundary states can be realized at the interface composed of topologically trivial (non-trivial) and positively (negatively) perturbed photonic crystals. Finally, a four-channel system based on the coexistence of the two effects is designed, The system is a novel electromagnetic wave router that can be selectively controlled by pseudospin degree of freedom or valley degree of freedom. This system provides a potential method for realizing the optical encoding and robust signal transmission, thereby providing greater flexibility for manipulating electromagnetic waves.

ABSTRACT: The latest advances in the field of photonics have enabled the simulation of an increasing number of quantum models in photonic systems, turning them into an important tool for realizing exotic quantum phenomena. In this paper, different ways in which these systems can be used to study the interplay between flat band dynamics, topology, and interactions in a well-known quasi-1 D topological insulator-the Creutz ladder-are suggested. First, a simple experimental protocol is proposed to observe the Aharonov-Bohm localization in the noninteracting system, and the different experimental setups that might be used for this are reviewed. The inclusion of a repulsive Hubbard-type interaction term, which can give rise to repulsively bound pairs termed doublons, is then considered. The dynamics of these quasiparticles are studied for different points of the phase diagram, including a regime in which pairs are localized and particles are free to move. Finally, a scheme for the photonic implementation of a two-particle bosonic Creutz-Hubbard model is presented.

ABSTRACT: "A bulk material comprising stacked nanosheets of nickel bis(dithiolene) complexes is investigated. The average oxidation number is -3/4 for each complex unit in the as-prepared sample  oxidation or reduction respectively can change this to 0 or -1. Refined electrical conductivity measurement, involving a single microflake sample being subjected to the van der Pauw method under scanning electron microscopy control, reveals a conductivity of 1.6 x 10 (2) S cm(1), which is remarkably high for a coordination polymeric material. Conductivity is also noted to modulate with the change of oxidation state. Theoretical calculation and photoelectron emission spectroscopy reveal the stacked nanosheets to have a metallic nature. This work provides a foothold for the development of the first organic-based two-dimensional topological insulator, which will require the precise control of the oxidation state in the single-layer nickel bisdithiolene complex nanosheet (cf. Liu, F. et al. Nano Lett. 2013, 13, 2842)."

ABSTRACT: Nonlinear optical experiments, especially the second-harmonic generation (SHG) of topological insulators (TIs) such as Bi2Te3 and Bi2Se3, provide significant insights into the second-order nonlinear susceptibility (chi((2))) of the topological surface states (TSS) and the DC electric field (E-dc), formed by the intrinsic band bending between the surface and bulk states. Importantly, by selectively tuning the polarization of the incident laser field from linear to circular, second-harmonic measurements in TIs enable us to extract these explicit contributions from the band bending (E-dc) and metallic surface states (chi((2))), respectively. In this work, we report the relaxation dynamics of the differential change in SHG intensity (Delta I(tau(pp)) = I-shg(pump on)(tau(pp)) - I-shg(pump off)) with respect to the pump-probe delay time (tau(pp)) in Bi2Te3 crystal, mainly emphasizing on different pump-probe polarization configurations to provide an understanding of the temporal evolution of Delta E-dc(tau(pp)) and Delta chi((2))(tau(pp)). Upon photoexcitation, Delta I(tau(pp)) with linearly polarized pump-probe configuration, we observe two opposing contributions to Delta E-dc, namely, the depletion electric field (DEF) and surface photovoltage (SPV) that effectively determine the spatial distribution of the bulk and surface carrier densities. However, on switching the probe polarization from linear to circular, we show that the SHG response has a predominant contribution from chi((2)), thereby extracting the time evolution of Delta chi((2)) arising from the TSS after photoexcitation, observed as an additional positive enhancement of Delta I(tau(pp)). This is analytically understood by opening a band gap of similar to 48 meV at the Dirac point due to the breaking of time reversal symmetry using circularly polarized light.

ABSTRACT: We report results of Raman and ellipsometric spectroscopy of the topological insulators Bi2Te3 and Bi2Se3 grown by molecular beam epitaxy on BaF2 (111) substrates. Surfaces and interfaces of the films are probed by Raman scattering from the front and back sides of the samples, which is possible owing to the transparent substrate. Surface modifications induced by intense illumination with exciting laser light have been detected, with excess tellurium at the surface during and after exposure.

ABSTRACT: In recent years, 2D layered materials, including graphene, topological insulators, transition metal dichalcogenides, black phosphorus, MXenes, graphitic carbon nitride, and metal-organic frameworks, have attracted considerable interest due to their potential applications in the fields of physics, chemistry, biology, and energy. Their rise in the field of nonlinear photonics began around 2009 and has become an important research direction. Here, the synthesis techniques, nonlinear optical properties, integration strategies, and device applications of layered materials are reviewed. In terms of nonlinear optical properties, the focus is on saturable absorption and Kerr nonlinearity. On this basis, their applications in various pulsed lasers, including fiber lasers, solid-state lasers, waveguide lasers, and related nonlinear optical phenomenon, are summarized. In addition, novel optical devices using layered materials, such as optical modulators, optical polarizers, optical switchers, and even all-optical device, are also involved. It is believed that the development of 2D layered materials in the field of photonics will continue to deepen, thus laying a good foundation for its practical application.

ABSTRACT: We study the effects of a synthetic gauge field and pseudospin-orbit interaction in a stacked two-dimensional ring-network model. The model was introduced to simulate light propagation in the corresponding ring-resonator lattice, and is thus completely bosonic. Without these two items, the model exhibits Floquet-Weyl and Floquet-topological-insulator phases with topologically gapless and gapped band structures, respectively. The synthetic magnetic field implemented in the model results in a three-dimensional Hofstadter-butterfly-type spectrum in a photonic platform. The resulting gaps are characterized by the winding number of relevant S-matrices together with the Chern number of the bulk bands. The pseudospin-orbit interaction is defined as the mixing term between two pseudospin degrees of freedom in the rings, namely, the clockwise and counter-clockwise modes. It destroys the Floquet-topological-insulator phases, while the Floquet-Weyl phase with multiple Weyl points can be preserved by breaking the space-inversion symmetry. Implementing both the synthetic gauge field and pseudospin-orbit interaction requires a certain nonreciprocity.

ABSTRACT: "Perfect vortex (PV) beams exhibiting topological charge-insensitive annular intensity distribution appear as a striking hotspot for significant advances in optical communication and quantum optics and have great potential to fulfill the requirements of futuristic optical communication systems. The recently developed planar photonics devices possessed an unprecedented ability for complex wavefront shaping at the micron scale  however, the limited working bandwidth and abruptly diverging light behavior of the current PV beam-generating planar photonics devices roadblock their applicability in practical systems. This work demonstrates a single-cell-driven broadband planar photonics platform to realize the nondiffracting-type PV beams for the visible spectrum. These PV beams exhibit long propagating constant-sized doughnuts for different topological charges and exhibit expected broadband response. The proposed concept is verified by numerically studying multiple meta-devices capable of generating nondiffracting-type PV beams. The presented photonics platform may bring considerable advances in real-life applications like machine vision."

ABSTRACT: In the orbital angular momentum (OAM) multiplexing communication system, due to the orthogonality between OAM modes, two vortex beams with different topological charges are orthogonally superimposed to generate a double-ring vortex beam. The double-ring vortex beam generated by this method can ensure the independent propagation of information without interference. In this paper, the intensity and phase distributions of the double-ring vortex beam are theoretically analyzed and verified experimentally. The results show that the orthogonal superposition of any two vortex beams with different topological charges can generate the double-ring vortex beam. The distance between the double rings increases with the increase in the difference between the absolute values of the topological charges of two vortex beams. Using double-ring vortex beam to carry different information at the same time provides a new approach for improving channel capacity and transmission stability.

ABSTRACT: In this work, using the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld integral and Berry formula, a topological charge (TC) of a Gaussian optical vortex with an initial fractional TC in the far field was calculated. It was found that, for diverse fractional parts of the TC, the beam contained different numbers of screw dislocations, which determined the TC of the entire beam. If a fractional part of the TC was small, the beam consisted of the main optical vortex centered on the optical axis, with the TC equal to the nearest integer (say n > 0) and two edge dislocations located on the vertical axis (one above and the other below the center). When the fractional part of the initial TC increased, a dipole was formed from the upper edge dislocation, consisting of two vortices with TCs equal to +1 and -1. With a further increase in the fractional part, the additional vortex with TC = +1 moved to the center of the beam, and the vortex with TC = -1 moved to the periphery. When the fractional part of the TC increased further, another dipole was formed from the lower edge dislocation, in which, on the contrary, the vortex with TC = -1 was displaced to the optical axis (to the center of the beam) and the vortex with TC = +1 moved to the beam periphery. When the fractional part of the TC became equal to 1/2, the lower vortex with a TC = -1, which was earlier displaced to the center of the beam, began to shift to the periphery, and the upper vortex with a TC = +1 moved closer and closer to the center of the beam, eventually merging with the main vortex when the fractional part approached 1. Such dynamics of additional vortices with TCs above +1 and below -1 determined which whole TC the beam would have (n or n + 1) for different values of the fractional part from the segment [n, n + 1]. Our analysis has shown that, for any value of the fractional part of the initial topological charge, the TC of the beam in the far field will not be determined. Since, with an increase in the radius of the circle in the beam section on which the TC is calculated, more optical dipoles will appear, and the TC will be either n or n + 1.

ABSTRACT: We propose a new scheme for recognizing the topological charge (TC) of orbital angular momentum (OAM) beams using convolutional neural networks (CNN) based on the focusing of cylindrical lenses and the detection of linear photodiode arrays (PDAs). Simulations and experiments are conducted. For the superimposed OAM sets with different TC values and different TC intervals, the effects of atmospheric turbulence disturbances on recognition accuracy are explored separately, where the turbulence disturbances to the superimposed OAM beams are measured by the coherence length r(0). The simulation results show that the recognition accuracy decreases as the turbulence disturbances increase. With 16-unit PDAs, the TC of the superimposed OAM set l is an element of{+/- 1, +/- 2, +/- 3, +/- 4} can be recognized with 100% accuracy under weak (the coherence length r(0) = 16.16 cm) and intermediate (the coherence length r(0) = 10.66 cm) turbulence disturbances, and above 90% accuracy under a strong (the coherence length r(0) = 4.06 cm) turbulence disturbance. In the experiment under weak (the coherence length r(0) = 13.01 cm) and intermediate (the coherence length r(0) = 8.59 cm) laboratory-simulated turbulence disturbances, with 16-unit PDAs, the recognition accuracy reaches 100% and 99.65%, respectively. The experimental results verify the results of the simulation.

ABSTRACT: Current assessment of cartilage is primarily based on identification of indirect markers such as joint space narrowing and increased subchondral bone density on x-ray images. In this context, phase contrast CT imaging (PCI-CT) has recently emerged as a novel imaging technique that allows a direct examination of chondrocyte patterns and their correlation to osteoarthritis through visualization of cartilage soft tissue. This study investigates the use of topological and geometrical approaches for characterizing chondrocyte patterns in the radial zone of the knee cartilage matrix in the presence and absence of osteoarthritic damage. For this purpose, topological features derived from Minkowski Functionals and geometric features derived from the Scaling Index Method (SIM) were extracted from 842 regions of interest (ROI) annotated on PCI-CT images of healthy and osteoarthritic specimens of human patellar cartilage. The extracted features were then used in a machine learning task involving support vector regression to classify ROIs as healthy or osteoarthritic. Classification performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). The best classification performance was observed with high-dimensional geometrical feature vectors derived from SIM (0.95 +/- 0.06) which outperformed all Minkowski Functionals (p < 0.001). These results suggest that such quantitative analysis of chondrocyte patterns in human patellar cartilage matrix involving SIM-derived geometrical features can distinguish between healthy and osteoarthritic tissue with high accuracy.

ABSTRACT: Manipulating photons in artificially structured materials is highly desired in modern photonic technology. Nontrivial topological structures are rapidly emerging as a state-of-art platform for achieving unprecedented fascinating phenomena of photon manipulation. However, the current studies mainly focus on planar structures, and the fabrication of photonic microstructures with specific topological geometric features still remains a great challenge. Extending the topological photonics to 3D microarchitectures is expected to enrich the photon manipulation capabilities and further advance the topological photonic devices. Here, a femtosecond laser direct writing technique is employed to fabricate 3D topological Mobius microring resonators from dye-doped polymer. The high-quality-factor Mobius microring resonator supports a unique spin-orbit coupled lasing at very low threshold. Due to the spin-orbit coupling induced geometric/Berry phase, the Mobius microrings, in striking contrast with ordinary microrings, output laser signals with all polarization states. The manipulation of miniaturized coherent light sources in the fabricated Mobius microrings represents a significant step forward toward 3D topological photonics that offers a novel design philosophy for functional photonic and optoelectronic devices.

ABSTRACT: Photons are weak particles that do not directly couple to magnetic fields. However, it is possible to generate a photonic gauge field by breaking reciprocity such that the phase of light depends on its direction of propagation. This non-reciprocal phase indicates the presence of an effective magnetic field for the light itself. By suitable tailoring of this phase, it is possible to demonstrate quantum effects typically associated with electrons, and, as has been recently shown, non-trivial topological properties of light. This paper reviews dynamicmodulation as a process for breaking the time-reversal symmetry of light and generating a synthetic gauge field, and discusses its role in topological photonics, as well as recent developments in exploring topological photonics in higher dimensions.

ABSTRACT: In imaging systems, a lens performs spatial Fourier transformation of the incoming waves, thereby mapping each plane wave into a point, or, equivalently, the lens focuses each set of parallel rays to a corresponding spot at the sensor array. Accordingly, two-dimensional (2D) vision requires a conventional 2D lens. This has been the common assumption since the dawn of free-space optics as a discipline. In this presentation. we demonstrate 2D image formation using a 1D lens. Such imaging is obtained in the context of RF phased arrays where image forming means beam forming of multiple beams simultaneously for receiving (transmitting) independent radio waves from (to) many different directions at the same time. The method is based on spatially coherent electro-optic up-conversion of the incoming radio signals to the optical domain and it exploits the arrangement of antennas in a regular array to map between different imaging topologies. Space-division multiple access (SDMA) enabled by this imaging modality is instrumental to ushering the age of virtually unlimited information bandwidth in wireless communication. The approach overcomes topological constraints of imaging systems in general. and of phased arrays in particular. We explain the principles of method and present experimental results illustrating its viability in a practical setting.

ABSTRACT: Fragile topology (FT) opens a new direction in topological photonics, but a new type of photonic crystal (PC) with FT remains to be proposed. In this Letter, the double-site honeycomb lattice (DSHL) PC is proposed by rotating the double dielectric rods (DDR) six times, forming unit cell, and then arraying the unit cells in a triangular lattice. Quantum spin Hall effect occurs by manipulating the DDR in the tangential and radial directions of the unit cell. First, the band structures of DSHL PCs with different structural parameters are calculated, and the laws of topological phase transition are analyzed statistically. Then, to prove the FT properties of two groups of topological nontrivial DSHL PCs, the Wannier-center positions of the bulk bands are calculated by the Wilson-Loop method. Finally, the topological edge states and two groups of topological corner states, which are in the same bulk-state bandgap, are realized successfully. The DSHL PC provides good platforms for both the research of topological photonics and the device design and application, which has a broad prospect. (C) 2021 Optical Society of America

ABSTRACT: In this work, using the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld integral and the Berry formula, the topological charge (TC) of a Gaussian optical vortex with an initial fractional TC is calculated. It is shown that for different fractional parts of the TC, the beam contains a different number of screw dislocations, which determine the TC of the entire beam. With a small fractional part of the TC, the beam consists of the main optical vortex centered on the optical axis with the TC equal to the nearest integer (let it be n), and two edge dislocations located on the vertical axis (above and below the center). With an increase in the fractional part of the initial TC, a dipole  is formed from the upper edge dislocation, consisting of two vortices with TC +1 and -1. With a further increase in the fractional part, the additional vortex with TC +1 is displaced to the center of the beam, and the vortex with TC -1 is displaced to the periphery. With a further increase in the fractional part of the TC, another dipole  is formed from the lower edge dislocation, in which, on the contrary, the vortex with TC -1 is displaced to the optical axis (to the center of the beam), and the vortex with TC +1 is displaced to the beam periphery. When the fractional part of the TC becomes equal to 1/2, the lower  vortex with TC -1, which was displaced to the center of the beam, begins to shift to the periphery, and the upper  vortex with TC + 1 moves closer and closer to the center of the beam and merges with the main vortex when the fractional part approaches 1. Such dynamics of additional vortices with upper TC +1 and lower TC -1 determine the whole TC of the beam have n or n + 1 for different values of the fractional part from the segment [n, n + 1].

ABSTRACT: Polarization measurement has been used for many optical applications in science and technology. Herein, we adopt a reliable method to measure the polarization parameters of incident light, including principal axis, chirality and ellipticity based on the superposition of two orthogonal vortex beams with non-integer topological charges (TCs). All three polarization parameters can be measured and analyzed by the interference pattern produced by the superposition of two vortex beams with l(1) = 1 and l(2) = 0.5. The relationship between the principal axis of polarization and the interference pattern is deduced theoretically. The measurement results agree with the theoretical formulation very well. The advantages of simplicity make this method have a good application prospect in polarization measurement, optical communication, micro-particles manipulation and quantum science.

ABSTRACT: Surface plasmon polariton (SPP) is an electromagnetic oscillation which is produced by the interaction of free electrons on metal surface with incident light field. Using some specific metal metasurface structures, plasmonic vortices can be easily obtained. The SPP can well confine the light field within the interface between metal and medium. The SPP has two excellent characteristics: the ability to break through the diffraction limit and the strong field enhancing effect. Consequently, it has unique advantages in many applications, such as nanoparticle trapping, near-field imaging and sensing. The key point lies in selecting the incident light and the construction of metasurface structure when we want to produce SPP vortices. Especially the construction of metasurface structure has great influence on the generation of SPP vortices. So far, many structures have been proposed to produce SPP vortices. In 2015, Byoungho Lee research group (Lee S Y, Kim S J, Kwon H, Lee B 2015 IEEE Photonics Technol. Lett. 27 705) designed a structure of double-ring distributed nanoslits which can produce high-order plasmonic vortices by circularly polarized light. In addition, the use of Archimedes slit structure to generate optical vortices is currently a more common method. More recently, a novel plasmonic vortex lens was proposed to produce SPP vortices with arbitrary topological charges. The plasmonic vortex lens consists of an array of gold film nanoslits, and the superposing of the SPP field excited by each nanoslit can produce a composite plasmonic vortex. Here, we propose a novel spiral metasurface structure for generating surface plasmonic vortices. Using the combination of theoretical analysis and finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulation, we find that the topological charge quantity of surface plasmon vortices can be changed by adjusting five parameters, namely, the chirality of incident circularly polarized light, the difference in radius between inner and outer nanocavity array, the rotational velocity factor of nanocavity array, the number of segments of spiral, and the pitch of spiral. This metasurface structure has many adjustable parameters and each parameter can influence the final surface plasmon vortices. Therefore, the plasmonic vortices with an arbitrary topological charge quantity can be generated and manipulated simply by using such a metasurface structure. This work can be expected to have a very broad prospect of applications in super resolution microscopy, quantum cryptography, nanoparticle manipulation, optical data storage, and optical communication.

ABSTRACT: "Photonic crystals (PhCs) have been demonstrated as a versatile platform for the study of topological phenomena. The recent discovery of higher-order topological insulators introduces new aspects of topological PhCs that are yet to be explored. Here, we propose an all-dielectric PhC with an unconventional higher-order band topology. Besides the conventional spectral features of gapped edge states and in-gap corner states, topological band theory predicts that the corner boundary of the higher-order topological insulator hosts a 2/3 fractional charge. We demonstrate that in the PhC such a fractional charge can be verified from the local density-of-states of photons, through the concept of local spectral charge as an analog of the local electric charge due to the band filling anomaly in electronic systems. Furthermore, we show that by introducing a disclination in the proposed PhC, localized states and a 2/3 fractional spectral charge emerge around the disclination core. The emergence of the fractional spectral charges and topological boundary modes here, however, is distinct from the known cases  particularly by the 2/3 fractional spectral charges and the unique topological indices. The predicted effects can be readily observed in the state-of-the-art experiments and may lead to potential applications in integrated and quantum photonics. (C) 2021 Chinese Laser Press"

ABSTRACT: Machine-learning has proven useful in distinguishing topological phases. However, there is still a lack of relevant research in the non-Hermitian community, especially from the perspective of the momentum-space. Here, an unsupervised machine-learning method, diffusion maps, is used to study non-Hermitian topologies in the momentum-space. Choosing proper topological descriptors as input datasets, topological phases are successfully distinguished in several prototypical cases, including a line-gapped tight-binding model, a line-gapped Floquet model, and a point-gapped tight-binding model. The datasets can be further reduced when certain symmetries exist. A mixed diffusion kernel method is proposed and developed, which could study several topologies at the same time and give hierarchical clustering results. As an application, a novel phase transition process is discovered in a non-Hermitian honeycomb lattice without tedious numerical calculations. This study characterizes band properties without any prior knowledge, which provides a convenient and powerful way to study topology in non-Hermitian systems.

ABSTRACT: In this paper, we demonstrated a passively mode-locked erbiumdoped fiber (EDF) laser by incorporating a tungsten disulfide (WS2) film SA fabricated by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method. The WS2 film was thickness-dependent, which had two different states: the bulk WS2 [faced to plasma plume] and tiny WS2 flakes [in the shadow of plasma plume]. This SA device demonstrated low insertion loss (IL) and high power tolerance ability. Interestingly, the SA device possessed different nonlinear absorption regimes related with the film states. By employing this new type of SA, we obtained stable fundamental mode-locking (FML) at pump power of 54 mW, and the generated soliton pulse had pulse duration of 675 fs and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 65 dB. At the maximum pump power of 395 mW, we also obtained up to 1 GHz repetition rate of harmonic mode-locking (HML) with pulse duration of 452 fs and SNR of 48 dB. The experimental results show that WS2-PLD film can serve as a promising SA for ultrafast laser systems. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America

ABSTRACT: In this paper, the fabrication process and characterization of Bi2Te3 topological insulators (TIs) synthesized by the spin-coating-coreduction approach (SCCA) is reported. With this approach, high-uniformity nano-crystalline TI saturable absorbers (TISAs) with large-area uniformity and controllable thickness are prepared. By employing these prepared TIs with different thicknesses as SAs in 2-mu m solid-state Q-switched lasers, thickness-dependent output powers and pulse durations of the laser pulses are obtained, and the result also exhibits stability and reliability. The shortest pulse duration is as short as 233 ns, and the corresponding clock amplitude jitter is around 2.1%, which is the shortest pulse duration in TlSA-based Q-switched 2-mu m lasers to the best of our knowledge. Moreover, in comparison with the TISA synthesized by the ultrasound-assisted liquid phase exfoliation (UALPE) method, the experimental results show that lasers with SCCA synthesized TISAs have higher output powers, shorter pulse durations, and higher pulse peak powers. Our work suggests that the SCCA synthesized TISAs could be used as potential SAs in pulsed lasers. (c) 2018 Chinese Laser Press

ABSTRACT: "In this work, we apply the group representation theory to systematically study polarization singularities in the inplane components of the electric fields supported by a planar electromagnetic (EM) resonator with generic rotation and reflection symmetries. We reveal the intrinsic connections between the symmetries and the topological features, i.e., the spatial configuration of the in-plane fields and the associated polarization singularities. The connections are substantiated by a simple relation that links the topological charges of the singularities and the symmetries of the resonator. To verify, a microwave planar resonator with the D8 group symmetries is designed and numerically simulated, which demonstrates the theoretical findings well. Our discussions can be applied to generic EM resonators working in a wide EM spectrum, such as circular antenna arrays, microring resonators, and photonic quasi-crystals, and provide a unique symmetry perspective on many effects in singular optics and topological photonics. & COPY  2023 Chinese Laser Press"

ABSTRACT: High-charge optical vortices, every photon of which carries an orbital angular momentum with a large quantum number, are ideal sources for testing macroscopic quantum entanglements. Also, they show great potential in angular remote sensing and precise spatial measurements. The optical vortices generated directly from laser, which are eigensolutions of laser cavity equation (Helmholtz equation), are naturally of ideal quality. So far, many attempts have been made to generate optical vortices directly from lasers, but the topological charge remains low (<10th order). Here, the generation of optical vortices with high topological charge directly from laser is reported. By laser inscribing round patterns on the surface of the cavity mirror, optical vortices with topological charges up to the 288th order are generated. A theoretical design criterion is proposed for generating arbitrary-charge optical vortices directly from laser, and even generation of over the 1000th-order vortex is feasible with this method. It is also experimentally demonstrated that the generated vortices from the laser are transmission stable and have a significant advantage over the vortices generated by phase elements. This work may open up application prospects of optical vortices in quantum optics and precise metrology.

ABSTRACT: Population growth, increasing energy demand, depletion of fossil resources and air pollution are chal-lenges related to electricity production. This essential source of energy for our daily lives, presents a glo-bal concern and pushes humanity to seek new clean and renewable alternatives. We propose in the present work an energy recovery structure optimized for an application in the road sector by implement-ing a dynamic weighing system (WIM) in the pavements and this using piezoelectric ceramics (PZT). These devices will be used for controlling the vehicle load and then converting the mechanical energy of the passage of the vehicle into reusable electrical energy. In order to improve this mechanical -electrical energy conversion, different architectures have been proposed and studied using digital simu-lation software using the finite element method. In order to choose the most optimal structure allowing the maximum conversion of electrical energy while supporting the weight of the vehicle during road traf-fic, several topological and geometric optimization studies have been proposed. The structure having val-idated the different optimization objectives is then studied in an application in the transport sector. The results found show that the optimized design is a good converter of mechanical energy into electricity with a power of 154.6 kW under a road traffic of 60,000 vehicles /day.Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Chalcogenide glass (ChG) materials are increasingly being utilized in infrared planar photonic devices due to their tailorable refractive indices and compatibility with other on-chip materials and manufacturing methodologies. The performance and reliability of such integrated photonic components in land or space-based environments where radiation impact structure and properties is important to their ultimate deployment. Bulk glasses and thermally evaporated thin films of As2Se3 were subjected to a gamma exposure of 229 Mrad to compare bulk/film material response and the impact of film thickness on such response. Positron annihilation lifetime (PAL) spectroscopy was employed to compare the effect of gamma irradiation on the different forms of the glass. The average positron lifetime was found to be longer for the films than the bulk glass in unirradiated specimens, and the films showed more significant increases in lifetimes with gamma exposure. This effect was more pronounced for thinner films, which showed, for example, an increase in positron lifetime. Positron lifetime was measured over the course of 20 days after exposure, over which the effect of the gamma radiation was found to relax at room temperature. Long-term or incomplete relaxation of the gamma-induced changes were observed in the films, while the bulk glass positron lifetime returned to pre-exposed values. A proposed mechanism for these observations based on coordination topological defects (CTD) is presented to explain the initial and longer term response, and the possible consequence when such films are integrated in device geometries.

ABSTRACT: "Phase-contrast X-ray computed tomography (PCI-CT) has attracted significant interest in recent years for its ability to provide significantly improved image contrast in low absorbing materials such as soft biological tissue. In the research context of cartilage imaging, previous studies have demonstrated the ability of PCI-CT to visualize structural details of human patellar cartilage matrix and capture changes to chondrocyte organization induced by osteoarthritis. This study evaluates the use of geometrical and topological features for volumetric characterization of such chondrocyte patterns in the presence (or absence) of osteoarthritic damage. Geometrical features derived from the scaling index method (SIM) and topological features derived from Minkowski Functionals were extracted from 1392 volumes of interest (VOI) annotated on PCI-CT images of ex vivo human patellar cartilage specimens. These features were subsequently used in a machine learning task with support vector regression to classify VOIs as healthy or osteoarthritic  classification performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Our results show that the classification performance of SIM-derived geometrical features (AUC: 0.90 +/- 0.09) is significantly better than Minkowski Functionals volume (AUC: 0.54 +/- 0.02), surface (AUC: 0.72 +/- 0.06), mean breadth (AUC: 0.74 +/- 0.06) and Euler characteristic (AUC: 0.78 +/- 0.04) (p < 10(-4)). These results suggest that such geometrical features can provide a detailed characterization of the chondrocyte organization in the cartilage matrix in an automated manner, while also enabling classification of cartilage as healthy or osteoarthritic with high accuracy. Such features could potentially serve as diagnostic imaging markers for evaluating osteoarthritis progression and its response to different therapeutic intervention strategies."

ABSTRACT: In this work, we show that suitable continuous superposition of zero-order Bessel beams, combined with the use of a mathematical operator which raises the topological charge of any optical beam, allow us to structure on demand non-diffracting hollow beams endowed with orbital angular momentum (OAM) within micrometer spatial domains. Our Analysis is exact and analytical, fully based on the Maxwell equations. Such method can find potential applications in many fields, specially those which require the use of highly non-paraxial optical beams, like optical tweezers, optical guiding of atoms, control of the OAM over microscopic regions and photonics in general.

ABSTRACT: We theoretically demonstrate nontrivial topological effects for a probe field in a Raman medium undergoing molecular modulation processes. The medium is driven by two noncollinear pump beams. We show that the angle between the pumps is related to an effective gauge potential and an effective magnetic field for the probe field in the synthetic space consisting of a synthetic frequency dimension and a spatial dimension. As a result of such an effective magnetic field, the probe field can exhibit a topologically protected one-way edge state in the synthetic space, as well as Landau levels which manifest as suppression of both diffraction and sideband generation. Our work identifies a previously unexplored route towards creating topological photonics effects and highlights an important connection between topological photonics and nonlinear optics.

Unlike previous works that focus on the Fermi arc surface states of a single Weyl structure, we can experimentally construct arbitrary interfaces between two Weyl structures whose orientations can be freely rotated in the synthetic parameter space. This intriguing system was difficult to realize in usual 3D Weyl semimetals due to lattice mismatch. We found whether the interface can host gapless topological interface states or not is determined by the relative rotational directions of the two Weyl structures. In the experiment, we have probed the local characteristics of the TISs through linear optical transmission and nonlinear second harmonic generation. Our study introduces a novel path to explore topological photonics on LNOI chips and various applications in integrated nonlinear and quantum optics.

ABSTRACT: "The quantum Hall effect (QHE) associated with Chern insulators reveals the non-trivial topological properties of two-dimensional electronic systems subject to strong magnetic field, which features finite Chern number C and chiral edge states. The latter promise robust electron transport and have received tremendous attention in both the condensed matter physics and classical systems including photonics and acoustics. In acoustics, circulating air flow has been introduced to create an effective gauge magnetic field, which breaks the time-reversal symmetry and leads to chiral edge states for acoustic waves. While the robust edge states may offer possible routes towards acoustic devices yielding unidirectional sound propagation, e.g., acoustic diodes, the mode density at the interfaces is limited by small Chern numbers of & PLUSMN  1 . Here, we realize acoustic Chern insulators with large Chern numbers, i.e., |C| & GE  1 (|C| = 1, 2, 3, 4). The system is based on circulating air flow in a sonic crystal (SC) with fourfold rotational symmetry. The large Chern numbers are obtained by breaking multiple accidental degeneracies at (non-)high-symmetric points. Based on these Chern insulators, acoustic diodes are realized by joining structures of different Chern numbers. Up to eight propagation modes are supported on the interfaces, greatly improving the mode density and hence the propagation efficiency. Our design offers possible routes towards high-efficient and topologically robust acoustic diodes, which may further inspire acoustic non-reciprocal devices based on topological Chern insulators. Experimentally, our proposals can be realized based on angular-momentum-biased resonator arrays."

ABSTRACT: Microcavities with whispering gallery modes (WGM), usually formed by two-dimensional (2D) circular structures, are significant elements in integrated optics, quantum information, and topological photonics. We report three-dimensional (3D) WGM from self-bent-up microdisks consisting of strain-released AlGaN/GaN bilayers, which provide an extra degree of freedom of the WGM photons in the vertical dimension, in contrast with the 2D WGM whose field mainly distributes in the horizontal plane. Despite the ultrathin and deformed cavity layer, the 3D WGM shows a reasonably high quality factor for GaN-based microdisks (similar to 1300) and exhibits single mode lasing due to the anisotropic feature of the bent-up disk, a unique advantage over the conventional planar microdisks of the same material and size. Such devices provide altitude dependence of emitting direction and are promising for applications in multilevel integrated photonics circuits.

ABSTRACT: "Anisotropic fluids are a class of soft materials that offer wide possibilities for engineering a small scale laboratory  their physical properties can be manipulated on short length scale by appropriate confining conditions and external stimuli leading the systems across fascinating phenomena. In this work, two of these phenomena are combined to create a microfluidic platform for reconfigurable nanoparticles (NPs) patterning: the formation of topological defects and the electrically controlled convective flows. Here, the nanoscopic environments created by defects within liquid crystals have been used as linear nano-reservoirs of NPs. Afterwards, virtual channel flows that connect the linear reservoirs have been created by exploiting electro-convective rolls. The reported results reveal a strategy for managing nanometric objects based on anisotropic fluids and connected phenomena, proposing an unconventional microfluidic device characterized by switchable and contactless micro-channels.

ABSTRACT: Optical modes bearing optical vortices are important light systems in which to encode information. Optical vortices are robust features of optical beams that do not dissipate upon propagation. Thus, decoding the modal content of a beam is a vital component of the process. In this work, we present a method to decode modal superpositions of light beams that contain optical vortices. We do so using shear interferometry, which presents a simple and effective means of determining the vortex content of a beam, and extract the parameters of the component vortex modes that constitute them. We find that optical modes in a beam are easily determined. Its modal content can be extracted when they are of comparable magnitude. The use of modes of well-defined topological charge, but not well-defined radial-mode content, such as those produced by phase-only encoding, are much easier to diagnose than pure Laguerre-Gauss modes.

ABSTRACT: Optical activity, also called circular birefringence, is known for two hundred years, but its applications for topological photonics remain unexplored. Unlike the Faraday effect, the optical activity provokes rotation of the linear polarization of light without magnetic effects, thus preserving the time-reversal symmetry. In this work, we report a direct measurement of the Berry curvature and quantum metric of the photonic modes of a planar cavity, containing a birefringent organic microcrystal (perylene) and exhibiting emergent optical activity. This experiment, performed at room temperature and at visible wavelength, establishes the potential of organic materials for implementing non-magnetic and low-cost topological photonic devices. Most work in topological photonics is performed in periodically structured systems. Here, the authors directly measure the nontrivial Berry curvature of the photonic modes of a birefringent continuous organic system exhibiting emergent optical activity.

ABSTRACT: This paper studies the response of a parity-time-symmetric Laguerre-Gaussian-cavity optomechanical system to a weak probe field, where an active cavity is coupled to a Laguerre-Gaussian rovibrational-cavity system. It is shown that three-amplification-peak profile emerges for the probe transmission. The transmission rate can be adjusted by controlling the coupling coefficient, the pump amplitude and the topological charge. Besides, we find that the light transmission group delay can be altered between positive and negative value by adjusting the coupling coefficient and the topological charge. This study can be applied to light propagation manipulation and quantum precision measurement.

ABSTRACT: Optical helicity provides us with an effective means to control the helicity-dependent photocurrent in the spin-momentum-locked surface states of topological insulators (TIs). Also, the TIs show potential in polarization de-tection as an intrinsic solid-state optical chirality detector for easier integration and fabrication. However, the com-plex photoresponses with the circular photogalvanic effect, the linear photogalvanic effect, and the photon drag effect in the TIs prevent them from direct chirality detection of the elliptically polarized light. Here, by fitting with the theoretical models to the measured photocurrents, the microscopic origin of different components of the helicity-dependent photocurrent has been demonstrated. We show a comprehensive study of the helicity-dependent photocurrent in (Bi1-xSbx)2Te3 thin films of different thicknesses as a function of the light incident angle and the gate-tuned chemical potential. The observation of the light incident angle dependence of the helicity-dependent photocurrent provides us with a polarization detection strategy using a TI thin film without the use of any additional optical elements, and the detection accuracy can be enhanced by gate tuning. Additionally, the Stokes parameters can be extracted by arithmetic operation of photocurrents measured with different incident angles and gating voltages for complete characterization of the polarization states of a light beam. Using this means, we realize the polarization detection and the Stokes parameters analysis with a single device. Our work provides an alter -native solution to develop miniaturized intrinsic polarization-sensitive photodetectors.(c) 2023 Chinese Laser Press

ABSTRACT: In this paper, comparative modeling of optical vortices focusing by phase and amplitude zone plates is presented. The FullWAVE software package based on finite difference time domain method was used for numerical simulation. The linearly polarized Gaussian vortex beams with wavelength of 532 nm, waist of 8 lam, and topological charge 1, 2 and 3 were proposed as incident light. It is shown that the material of zone plate can significantly influence on focusing process. However, than the higher the topological charge of incident beam the more similar formed by phase and amplitude zone plats at the focus fields are.

ABSTRACT: A review is given on the foundations and applications of non-Hermitian classical and quantum physics. First, key theorems and central concepts in non-Hermitian linear algebra, including Jordan normal form, biorthogonality, exceptional points, pseudo-Hermiticity, and parity-time symmetry, are delineated in a pedagogical and mathematically coherent manner. Building on these, we provide an overview of how diverse classical systems, ranging from photonics, mechanics, electrical circuits, and acoustics to active matter, can be used to simulate non-Hermitian wave physics. In particular, we discuss rich and unique phenomena found therein, such as unidirectional invisibility, enhanced sensitivity, topological energy transfer, coherent perfect absorption, single-mode lasing, and robust biological transport. We then explain in detail how non-Hermitian operators emerge as an effective description of open quantum systems on the basis of the Feshbach projection approach and the quantum trajectory approach. We discuss their applications to physical systems relevant to a variety of fields, including atomic, molecular and optical physics, mesoscopic physics, and nuclear physics with emphasis on prominent phenomena and subjects in quantum regimes, such as quantum resonances, superradiance, the continuous quantum Zeno effect, quantum critical phenomena, Dirac spectra in quantum chromodynamics, and nonunitary conformal field theories. Finally, we introduce the notion of band topology in complex spectra of non-Hermitian systems and present their classifications by providing the proof, first given by this review in a complete manner, as well as a number of instructive examples. Other topics related to non-Hermitian physics, including nonreciprocal transport, speed limits, nonunitary quantum walk, are also reviewed.

ABSTRACT: Artificial gauge fields enable uncharged particles to behave as if affected by external fields. Generated by geometry or modulation, artificial gauge fields are instrumental in realizing topological physics in photonics, cold atoms and acoustics. Here, we experimentally demonstrate waveguiding by artificial gauge fields. We construct artificial gauge fields by using waveguide arrays with non-trivial trajectories. Tilting the arrays results in gauge fields that are different in the core and cladding, shifting their dispersion curves, thereby confining the light to the core. In a more advanced setting, we demonstrate waveguiding in a medium with the same gauge and dispersion everywhere, where the only difference between the core and the cladding is a phase shift in the dynamics of the gauge fields, which facilitates waveguiding via bound states in the continuum. Waveguiding and bound states in the continuum via artificial gauge fields relate to a plethora of systems, ranging from photonics and microwaves to cold atoms and acoustics.

ABSTRACT: As a typical kind of two-dimensional transition metal carbides, nitrides and/or carbonitrides (MXene), Ti3C2Tx has attracted extensive attention in optoelectronic field owing to their outstanding thermal, optoelectronic, and nonlinear optical properties. Ti3C2Tx has been widely used as saturable absorber (SA) for achieving ultrafast pulses, whereas the influence of recovery time on its nonlinear optical properties as SA in laser needs further exploration. Herein, the ultrafast dynamics and nonlinear optical properties of Ti3C2Tx are investigated by the methods of transient absorption and balanced twin-detector measurements. According to the experimental results, Ti3C2Tx has a bleaching recovery time more than 160 ps, resulting in a low saturation intensity. The prepared Ti3C2Tx is utilized as SA to achieve Q-switched pulses at 1- and 1.5 mu m bands. This study demonstrates that ultrafast dynamics has a significant impact on adjusting and optimizing nonlinear optical parameters of MXenes, as well as designing new photonic devices.

ABSTRACT: The tight focusing properties of circular partially coherent radially polarized circular Airy vortex beams (CPCRPCAVBs) are theoretically studied in this paper. After deriving the cross-spectral density matrix of CPCRPCAVBs in the focal region of a high-NA objective, numerical calculations were performed to indicate the influence of the topological charge of the vortex phase on intensity distribution, degree of coherence and degree of polarization of the tightly focused beam. An intensity profile along the propagation axis shows that a super-length optical needle (similar to 15 lambda) can be obtained with a topological charge of 1, and a super-length dark channel (similar to 15 lambda) is observed with a topological charge of 2 or 3. In the focal plane, the rise in the number of topological charge does not distort the shapes of the coherence distribution pattern and the polarization distribution pattern, but enlarges their sizes.

ABSTRACT: The on-chip integrated visible microlaser is a core unit of high-speed visible-light communication with huge bandwidth resources, which needs robustness against fabrication errors, compressible linewidth, reducible threshold, and in-plane emission. However, until now, it has been a great challenge to meet these requirements simultaneously. Here, we report a scalable strategy to realize a robust on-chip integrated visible microlaser with further improved lasing performances enabled by the increased orders (n) of exceptional surfaces, and experimentally verify the strategy by demonstrating the performances of a second-order exceptional surface-tailored microlaser. We further prove the potential application of the strategy by discussing an exceptional surface-tailored topological microlaser with unique performances. This work lays a foundation for further development of on-chip integrated high-speed visible-light communication and processing systems, provides a platform for the fundamental study of non-Hermitian photonics, and proposes a feasible method of joint research for non-Hermitian photonics with nonlinear optics and topological photonics.

ABSTRACT: Bound state in the continuum (BIC) is a mathematical concept with an infinite radiative quality factor (Q) that exists only in an ideal infinite array of resonators. In photonics, it is essential to achieve high Q resonances for enhanced light-mater interactions that could enable low-threshold lasers, ultrasensitive sensors, and optical tweezers. Hence, it is important to explore BICs in different photonic systems including subwavelength metamaterials where symmetry-protected dual BICs exist. The spectral features of dual BICs are experimentally verified in the terahertz domain by breaking the C-2 symmetry that invokes a leakage channel in the form of weakly radiating Fano resonance and electromagnetically induced transparency. The radiative Q factors tend to infinity at discrete symmetry-restoring points and obey an inverse square dependence on the structural asymmetry. BICs in metamaterials allow extreme field confinement with small mode volumes, thereby improving the rate of spontaneous emission in the cavity with much larger Purcell factor. In addition, the topological nature enables a robust existence of BICs with a vector beam profile that is ideal for lasing. The symmetry-protected BICs in metamaterials also possess a unique advantage of scalability at different wavelengths for potential applications in sensing, lasing, switching, and spectral filtering.

ABSTRACT: The ability to control the spin-orbit interaction (SOI) of light in optical microresonators is of fundamental importance for future photonics. Organic microcrystals, due to their giant optical anisotropy, play a crucial role in spin-optics and topological photonics. Here, the controllable and wavelength-dependent Rashba-Dresselhaus (RD) SOI is realized that is attributed to the anisotropic excitonic response in an optical microcavity filled with an organic microcrystalline. This work investigates the transition of the spin-splitting from twice winding caused by the splitting of the transverse-electric and transverse-magnetic modes to once winding caused by the RD effect. The interplay of the two allows engineer the SOI of light in organic microcavities, which besides its fundamental interest promises applications in spin-controlled on-chip integrated nanophotonic elements, toward exploiting nonmagnetic and low-cost spin-photonic devices.

ABSTRACT: In this study, the topological insulator (TI) antimony telluride (Sb2Te3) was used as a saturable absorber (SA) to obtain stable mode-locked pulses in a thulium holmium-doped fiber laser (THDFL). A liquid-phase exfoliation (LPE) approach was used to obtain the SA material without chemicals or surfactants. The SA device was prepared by drop-casting the material onto the arc-shaped fiber for integration into the 2.0 mu m laser cavity. The prepared device also exhibits nonlinear absorption properties with normalized modulation depth, saturation intensity, and non-saturable loss of 36.16 %, 0.046 MW/cm(2), and 63.84 %, respectively. Furthermore, stable mode-locked pulses were readily obtained at a pump power of 307.60 mW, where the center wavelength of the laser was recorded to be 1902.06 nm with a full width at half maximum of 2.88 nm. The pulses had a repetition rate of 10.88 MHz and pulse width of 1.32 ps with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) value of about 61.21 dB. The results show that Sb2Te3 SA demonstrated excellent performance and can be further explored for future photonics applications.

ABSTRACT: Mapping the environment is a powerful technique for enabling autonomy through localization and planning in robotics. This article seeks to provide a global overview of actionable map construction in robotics, outlining the basic problems, introducing techniques for overcoming them, and directing the reader toward established research covering these problem and solution domains in more detail. Multiple levels of abstraction are covered in a non-exhaustive vertical slice, starting with the fundamental problem of constructing metric occupancy grids with Simultaneous Mapping and Localization techniques. On top of these, topological meshes and semantic maps are reviewed, and a comparison is drawn between multiple representation formats. Furthermore, the datasets and metrics used in performance benchmarks are discussed, as are the challenges faced in some domains that deviate from typical laboratory conditions. Finally, recent advances in robot control without explicit map construction are touched upon.

ABSTRACT: Photonic crystals (PhC) represent an important class of silicon photonics components employed as wavelength selective resonators to act as narrow-band mirrors in integrated lasers due to their small footprint, high surface area, and Q-factor/volume ratio that enables efficient confinement of light, required for improved performances of the laser. These properties of PhCs are key for the potential deployment of PhC based high power, energy efficient and versatile semiconductor lasers for telecom, datacom, optical sensing and biomedical applications. In this paper, we report the main advances on PhC based lasers from photonic crystal surface-emitting lasers (PCSELs) to the new hybrid external cavity laser (HECLs) configurations.

ABSTRACT: A nodal link is a special form of a line degeneracy (a nodal line) between adjacent bands in the momentum space of a three-dimensional topological crystal. Unlike nodal chains or knots, a nodal link consists of two or more mutually linked rings that do not touch each other. Recent studies on non-Abelian band topology revealed that the topological charges of the nodal links can have the properties of quaternions. However, a photonic crystal that has a nodal link with non-Abelian charges has not been reported. Here, we propose dielectric photonic crystals in the form of double diamond structures that realize the nodal links in the momentum space. By examining the evolution of the eigenstate correlations along closed loops that enclose the nodal line(s) of the links, their non-Abelian topological charges are also analyzed. The proposed design scheme and theoretical approach in this work will allow for experimental observation of photonic non-Abelian charges in purely dielectric materials and facilitate the control of the degeneracy in complex photonic structures.

ABSTRACT: In this paper, we demonstrate a regrowth-free monolithically integrated photonics circuit which consists of a tunable, single-frequency, low-linewidth 1x2 multimode-interferometer laser diode (MMILD) and two waveguide devices connected with the two arms of the laser and electrically isolated by deep etched slots. In this photonic integrated circuit (PIC), the 1x2 MMILD showed similar tuning and single frequency performance as the discrete 1x2 MMILD, with more than 30dB side mode suppression ratio (SMSR). The integrated waveguide devices could be used as semiconductor optical amplifiers, photodiodes or electro-absorption modulators, thus the integrated circuit could be used for different functions. The integrability of the MMI lasers indicates its potential applicability in more advanced low-cost topological PICs.

ABSTRACT: Optical skyrmion lattices play an important role in photonic system design and have potential applications in optical transmission and storage. In this study, we propose a novel metasurface approach to calculating the dependence of the multi-beam interference principle and the angular momentum action in the spin-orbit interaction. The metasurface consists of nanopore structures, which are used to generate an optical skyrmion lattice. The superposition of optical vortex beams with circular polarization states is used to evaluate the evolution of the shape of the topological domain walls of the hexagonal skyrmion lattice. Our results show that the distribution of the skyrmion spin vector can be controlled by changing the lattice arrangement from triangular to hexagonal shapes. The distribution of skyrmion number at the microscale is further calculated. Our work has significant implications for the regulation of the shape of topological domain walls of skyrmion lattices, with potential applications in polarization sensing, nanopositioning, and super-resolution microimaging.

ABSTRACT: The key result of this work is the use of the global characteristics of the polarization singularities of the entire beam as a whole, rather than the analysis of local polarization, Stokes and Poincare-Hopf indices. We extend Berry's concept of the topological charge of scalar beams to hybrid vector beams. We discuss tightly focusing a new type of nth-order hybrid vector light field comprising n C-lines (circular polarization lines). Using a complex Stokes field, it is shown that the field polarization singularity index equals n/2 and does not preserve in the focal plane. The intensity and Stokes vector components in the focal plane are expressed analytically. It is theoretically and numerically demonstrated that at an even n, the intensity pattern at the focus is symmetrical, and instead of C-lines, there occur C-points around which axes of polarization ellipses are rotated. At n = 4, C-points characterized by singularity indices 1/2 and 'lemon'-type topology are found at the focus. For an odd source field order n, the intensity pattern at the focus has no symmetry, and the field becomes purely vectorial (with no elliptical polarization) and has n V-points, around which linear polarization vectors are rotating.

ABSTRACT: As photonic integration continues to evolve, compact and low loss Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZI) have been an area of significant research in recent years. Here, we propose a valley-Hall effect based topologically protected Mach-Zehnder interferometer (TPMZI). Our simulations show that the TPMZI is efficient and stable even in complex situations. Sharp waveguide bending and defects such as obstructions and epitaxial disorders, do not affect the propagation of photons along the interface, which guarantees the TPMZI high output power. In addition, the TPMZI yields excellent sensitivity, extinction ratio and modulation depths, making it advantageous over existing systems when applied to optical communication, biochemical sensing, spectrometer analysis and measurement systems, etc.

ABSTRACT: By employing the ultrafast Z-scan technique, we characterize the nonlinear absorption property of PMMA/Bismuth Selenide (Bi (2) Se (3)) composite with varying concentrations. We report the fabrication of bismuth selenide (Bi (2) Se (3)) nanoplate (topological insulator (TI)) doped poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA) thin film with varying doping concentrations. The effect of Bi (2) Se (3) on structural and linear properties of PMMA thin film has been investigated through UV-Vis spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope (SEM), and Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping techniques. Furthermore, the nonlinear optical absorption property of PMMA and PMMA/Bi (2) Se (3) composites have been performed employing a single beam open aperture z-scan technique under femtosecond laser excitation at 750 nm. The z-scan results exhibit an enhancement of reverse saturable absorption (RSA) property with an increased nonlinear absorption coefficient (beta) of the PMMA/Bi (2) Se (3) composites compared to pure PMMA measured with intensity at 320 GW cm(-2). The RSA response gets enhanced with the increase in doping concentration also. Our experimental observations reveal that PMMA/Bi (2) Se (3) composite can provide a promising platform to realize photonic devices such as optical limiters, optical switches, and efficient protectors from high power sources.

ABSTRACT: Bright solitons are produced through the interaction of pulse pairs generated via a continuous-wave fibre laser, which pumps two coupled microresonators featuring normal dispersion. Multicolour pulse pairs over multiple rings can also be generated, of great promise for applications such as all-optical soliton buffers and memories, study of quantum combs and topological photonics. Soliton microcombs are helping to advance the miniaturization of a range of comb systems. These combs mode lock through the formation of short temporal pulses in anomalous dispersion resonators. Here, a new microcomb is demonstrated that mode locks through the formation of pulse pairs in coupled normal dispersion resonators. Unlike conventional microcombs, pulses in this system cannot exist alone, and instead phase lock in pairs wherein pulses in each pair feature different optical spectra. The pairwise mode-locking modality extends to multiple pulse pairs and beyond two rings, and it greatly constrains mode-locking states. Two- (bipartite) and three-ring (tripartite) states containing many pulse pairs are demonstrated, including crystal states. Pulse pairs can also form at recurring spectral windows. We obtained the results using an ultra-low-loss Si3N4 platform that has not previously produced bright solitons on account of its inherent normal dispersion. The ability to generate multicolour pulse pairs over multiple rings is an important new feature for microcombs. It can extend the concept of all-optical soliton buffers and memories to multiple storage rings that multiplex pulses with respect to soliton colour and that are spatially addressable. The results also suggest a new platform for the study of topological photonics and quantum combs.

ABSTRACT: Non-reciprocal devices, such as circulators and isolators, are indispensable components in classical and quantum information processing in integrated photonic circuits(1). Aside from these applications, the non-reciprocal phase shift is of fundamental interest for exploring exotic topological photonics(2), such as the realization of chiral edge states and topological protection(3,4). However, incorporating low-optical-loss magnetic materials into a photonic chip is technically challenging(5). In this study we experimentally demonstrate non-magnetic non-reciprocity using optomechanical interactions in a whispering gallery micro resonator, as proposed in a previous work(6). Optomechanically induced non-reciprocal transparency and amplification are observed and a non-reciprocal phase shift of up to 40 degrees is also demonstrated. The underlying mechanism of optomechanically induced non-reciprocity has great potential for all-optical controllable isolators and circulators, as well as non-reciprocal phase shifters in integrated photonic chips.

ABSTRACT: "Recent realization of nontrivial topological phases in photonic systems has provided unprecedented opportunities in steering light flow in novel manners. Based on the Su-Schriffer-Heeger (SSH) model, a topologically protected optical mode was successfully demonstrated in a plasmonic waveguide array with a kinked interface that exhibits a robust nonspreading feature. However, under the same excitation conditions, another antikinked structure seemingly cannot support such a topological interface mode, which appears to be inconsistent with the SSH model. Theoretical calculations are carried out based on the coupled-mode theory, in which the mode properties, excitation conditions, and the robustness are studied in detail. It is revealed that under the exact eigenstate excitations, both kinked and antikinked structures do support such robust topological interface modes  however, for a realistic single-waveguide input only the kinked structure does so. It is concluded that the symmetry of interface eigenmodes plays a crucial role, and the odd eigenmode in a kinked structure offers the capacity to excite the nonspreading interface mode in the realistic excitation of a one-waveguide input. Our finding deepens the understanding of mode excitation and propagation in coupled waveguide systems, and could open a new avenue in optical simulations and photonic designs."

ABSTRACT: With the help of computer methods (software package ToposPro), geometric and topological analysis and modeling of the self-assembly of crystal structures of intermetallic compounds Cs6Hg40-cP46 , a = 10.913 angstrom, Pm-3n and Cs12Hg162-cI174 , a = 16.557 angstrom, and Im-3 are carried out. The precursor metal clusters are determined using an algorithm for decomposing structural graphs into cluster structures and by constructing a basic grid of the structure in the form of a graph whose nodes correspond to the position of the centers of the precursor clusters . In the crystal structure Cs6Hg40-cP46, two-layer icosahedral clusters S-3(0) K45 = Hg@Hg-12@Cs12Hg20 are established, and for the crystal structure Cs12Hg162-cI174, three-layer icosahedral clusters K81 = Hg@Hg-12@Hg-32@Hg-36 are defined with symmetry g = m-3 and Cs-spacers. The symmetry and topological code of the processes of self-assembly of crystal structures of intermetallic compounds from precursors S-3(0) is reconstructed in the following form: chain S-3(1) -> microlayer S-3(2) -> microframe S-3(3) .

ABSTRACT: We describe novel topological phases of isofrequency k-space surfaces in bianisotropic optical materials-tri- and tetrahyperbolic materials-which are induced by the introduction of chirality. This completes the classification of isofrequency topologies for bianisotropic materials, as we showed that all optical materials belong to one of the following topological classes-tetra-, tri-, bi-, mono-, or nonhyperbolic. We showed that phase transitions between these classes occur in the k-space directions with zero group velocity at high k-vectors. This classification is based on the sets of high-k polaritons (HKPs), supported by materials. We obtained the equation describing these sets and characterized the longitudinal polarization-impedance of HKPs.

ABSTRACT: Thouless pumping provides one of the simplest manifestations of topology in quantum systems and has attracted a lot of recent interest, both theoretically and experimentally. Since the seminal works by David Thouless and Qian Niu in 1983 and 1984, it has been argued that the quantization of the pumped charge is robust against weak disorder, but a clear characterization of the localization properties of the relevant states, and the breakdown of quantized transport in the presence of interaction or out of the adiabatic approximation, has long been debated. Thouless pumping is also the first example of a topological phase emerging in a periodically driven system. Driven systems can exhibit exotic topological phases without any static analogue and have been the subject of many recent proposals both in fermionic and in bosonic systems. Recent experimental studies have been performed in diverse platforms ranging from cold atoms to photonics and condensed-matter systems. This Review serves as a basis to understand the robustness of the topology of slowly driven systems and also highlights the rich properties of topological pumps and their diverse range of applications. Examples include systems with synthetic dimensions or work towards understanding higher-order topological phases, which underline the relevance of topological pumping for the fast-growing field of topological quantum matter.

ABSTRACT: In this work, we expand a remarkable finding reported by Soskin et al (1997 Phys. Rev. A 56 4064). We show that for an on-axis superposition of two different-waist Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beams with numbers (0, n) and (0, m), the topological charge remains equal to TC = m up to a plane where the beams waists become the same, provided that the LG beam (0, m) has a larger waist, becoming equal to TC = n after that plane. The effect can be due to an on-axis optical vortex (OV) with TC = m in the original plane of the superposition, complemented by (n- m) extra OVs with TC = +1 found at different radii and (n- m) OVs with TC = -1. On approaching the said plane, the OVs with TC = -1 'go to' infinity with a higher-than-light speed, with the TC of the superposition becoming equal to TC = n. Vice versa, if the initial waist radius of the LG beam (0, m) is smaller, the superposition has TC = n on a distance from the initial plane to an equal-radius plane, changing to TC = m afterwards. This effect occurs due to n- m OVs with TC = -1 'coming from' infinity after the plane of interest.

ABSTRACT: It is theoretically shown how a Gaussian beam with a finite number of parallel lines of intensity nulls (edge dislocations) is transformed using a cylindrical lens into a vortex beam that carries orbital angular momentum (OAM) and has a topological charge (TC). In the initial plane, this beam already carries OAM, but does not have TC, which appears as the beam propagates further in free space. Using an example of two parallel lines of intensity nulls symmetrically located relative to the origin, we show the dynamics of the formation of two intensity nulls at the double focal length: as the distance between the vertical lines of intensity nulls is being increased, two optical vortices are first formed on the horizontal axis, before converging to the origin and then diverging on the vertical axis. At any distance between the zero-intensity lines, the optical vortex has the topological charge TC = -2, which conserves at any on-axis distance, except the initial plane. When the distance between the zero-intensity lines changes, the OAM that the beam carries also changes. It can be negative, positive, and at a certain distance between the lines of intensity nulls OAM can be equal to zero. It is also shown that for an unlimited number of zero-intensity lines, a beam with finite OAM and an infinite TC is formed.

ABSTRACT: The field of topological photonics has made great strides in the past decade with many new designs based on bandgap and band inversion structures that provide robust, unidirectional, and reflection-free propagation of energy. The topological invariant or Chern number of a metamaterial guarantees the existence of topologically protected edge modes. However, its mathematical application to real systems is not always straightforward and can be greatly simplified by reducing the dimensional complexity of the problem by the calculation of a Zak phase that determines the topological phase in just one dimension. This work explores two methods of creating interface modes with finite height dielectric slabs: (1) transverse resonance through variable edge truncation of a photonic crystal (PhC) or cell sliding and (2) a uni-axial topological phase by means of scaling the internal features of a unit cell. The proposed metamaterial devices use the same C 4 v symmetric unit cell structure on both sides of the interface and are finite in all three dimensions, allowing for easy fabrication, excitation, and implementation in real-world applications. The all-dielectric design also enables an easy transition to and from conventional PhC waveguides and lends itself well to operation in frequencies spanning across the microwave and optical spectrum without concerns of additional metallic losses in the THz region.

ABSTRACT: The concept of synthetic dimensions in photonics has attracted rapidly growing interest in the past few years. Among a variety of photonic systems, the ring resonator system under dynamic modulation has been investigated in depth both in theory and experiment and has proven to be a powerful way to build synthetic frequency dimensions. In this Tutorial, we start with a pedagogical introduction to the theoretical approaches in describing the dynamically modulated ring resonator system and then review experimental methods in building such a system. Moreover, we discuss important physical phenomena in synthetic dimensions, including nontrivial topological physics. This Tutorial provides a pathway toward studying the dynamically modulated ring resonator system and understanding synthetic dimensions in photonics and discusses future prospects for both fundamental research and practical applications using synthetic dimensions.

ABSTRACT: Anisotropic plasmonic surface supports elliptic, hyperbolic and even flattened polaritons, which is quite interesting for the diffractionless and highly collimated propagation of infrared light at the nanoscale. However, direct real-space near-field observation of anisotropic plasmons as well as frequency dependent topological transitions in natural materials have not been realized. In this paper, we theoretically investigate real-space anisotropic plasmons in WTe2 thin films by using a phenomenological cavity model, anisotropic near-field plasmonic images with specific interference patterns and isofrequency curves in momentum space have been demonstrated. Due to the frequency selective forbidden of plasmons along b axis, a topological transition from the elliptic to the hyperbolic regime is manifested. Moreover, the plasmons as well as topological transition present significant electrostatic-gating tunability. Our studies provide new insights into WTe2 based plasmonic components for the manipulation of plasmon propagation, which capable of tailoring anisotropic two-dimensional light confinement in the far-infrared regime and can be applied to investigate other anisotropic materials.

ABSTRACT: We study coaxial superpositions of Gaussian optical vortices described by a geometric progression. The topological charge (TC) is obtained for all variants of such superpositions. The TC can be either integer or half-integer in the initial plane. However, it always remains integer when the light field propagates in free space. In the general case, the geometric progression of optical vortices (GPOV) has three integer parameters and one real parameter, values which define its TC. The GPOV does not conserve its intensity structure during propagation in free space. However, the beam can have the intensity lobes whose number is equal to one of the family parameters. If the real GPOV parameter is equal to one, then all angular harmonics in the superposition are of the same energy. In this case, the TC of the superposition is equal to the order of the average angular harmonic in the progression. Thus, if the first angular harmonic in the progression has the TC of k and the last harmonic has the TC of n, then the TC of the entire superposition in the initial plane is equal to (n + k)/2, but the TC is equal to n during propagation. The experimental results on generating of the GPOVs by a spatial light modulator are in a good agreement with the simulation results.

ABSTRACT: The possibility of realizing fractional quantum Hall liquids in photonic systems has attracted a great deal of interest of late. Unlike electronic systems, interactions in photonic systems must be engineered from nonlinear elements and are thus subject to positional disorder. The stability of the topological liquid relies on repulsive interactions. In this paper we investigate the stability of fractional quantum Hall liquids to impurities which host attractive interactions. Employing the Bose-Hubbard model with a magnetic field, we find that for sufficiently strong attractive interactions these impurities can destroy the topological liquid. However, we find that the liquid is quite robust to these defects, a fact which bodes well for the realization of topological quantum Hall liquids in photonic systems.

ABSTRACT: Band structures of the photonic crystal slabs play a significant role in manipulating the flow of light and predicting exotic physics in photonics. In this Letter, we show that the key features of photonic band structures can be achieved experimentally by the polarization- and momentum-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy utilizing the light emission properties of SiNx. The two-dimensional spectra clearly reveal the energy-momentum dispersion of band structures, which is in perfect agreement with the simulation results. The isofrequency contours can be measured easily by adding a bandpass filter with a desired photon energy. Furthermore, it is convenient to observe clearly and directly the optical singularity-the optical bound states in the continuum featured by dark point in three-dimensional photoluminescence spectra. The polarization-resolved isofrequency contours clearly show that this dark point is the center of an azimuthally polarized vortex. Finally, the helical topological edge states can be easily observed in photonic topological insulators with deformed hexagonal lattices. Our work provides a simple and effective approach for exploring topological photonics and other intriguing phenomena hidden in the photonic crystal slabs.

ABSTRACT: Recent advances in the field of photonics and topological physics can be combined to offer a solution to planar 6G, above 100 GHz, communication devices. As specific examples, we demonstrate that a hybrid photonic crystal waveguide can support a single-mode transmission covering 0.367-0.411 THz (over twice as wide as that of all-silicon photonic crystal waveguides). By breaking the photonic crystal symmetry, topologically protected modes can be introduced with a single mode linear-dispersion transmission window (over 0.143-0.162 THz) and robust transmission around sharp corners without any deterioration in the bandwidth. Such topologically protected waveguides, here produced using simple 3D printing techniques, offer a unique simplification in design. The absence of coupling to back-propagating modes removes the requirement to carefully design away spurious resonances, offering a pathway to a truly versatile planar platform for integrated 6G devices with low loss and wide bandwidth.

ABSTRACT: We study a novel family of mth-order cosine Gaussian optical vortex beams with an infinite (but countable) number of screw dislocations, each with the topological charge m. An expression is derived for the normalized-to-power orbital angular momentum (OAM) of such beams. The OAM is shown to increase quadratically with the order m. The transverse intensity distributions of such beams consists of two light spots residing on a straight line orthogonal to the straight line with points of phase singularity. The OAM-spectrum of such beams is almost symmetric and the order (topological charge) of the central harmonic in this spectrum is approximately equal to the normalized OAM of the beam. Each such beam is a superposition of an infinite number of the single-ringed Laguerre-Gaussian modes with only even and nonnegative azimuthal indices. Such rotating two-petal beams can be used for increasing the longitudinal resolution in the optical microscopy.

ABSTRACT: The flourishing of topological photonics in the last decade was achieved mainly due to developments in linear topological photonic structures. However, when nonlinearity is introduced, many intriguing questions arise. For example, are there universal fingerprints of the underlying topology when modes are coupled by nonlinearity, and what can happen to topological invariants during nonlinear propagation? To explore these questions, we experimentally demonstrate nonlinearity-induced coupling of light into topologically protected edge states using a photonic platform and develop a general theoretical framework for interpreting the mode-coupling dynamics in nonlinear topological systems. Performed on laser-written photonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattices, our experiments show the nonlinear coupling of light into a nontrivial edge or interface defect channel that is otherwise not permissible due to topological protection. Our theory explains all the observations well. Furthermore, we introduce the concepts of inherited and emergent nonlinear topological phenomena as well as a protocol capable of revealing the interplay of nonlinearity and topology. These concepts are applicable to other nonlinear topological systems, both in higher dimensions and beyond our photonic platform. Topological photonics: nonlinear couplingAn engineered photonic system has provided insights into the interplay between nonlinearity and topology. Shiqi Xia and coworkers used laser-writing technique to fabricate refractive-index patterns that form a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattice in a nonlinear optical crystal of strontium-barium-niobate (SBN:61), a well-known photorefractive material. Due to the presence of the nonlinearity, two optical beams of sufficient power propagating in different directions can, when they collide, couple into a non-trivial interface state in the system, which is otherwise not accessible due to topological protection. Theoretical analysis correctly explains the observed behavior and the nonlinear coupling phenomenon. The researchers say that their findings are of a general nature and can be applied to other nonlinear topological systems.

ABSTRACT: Thanks to the unlimited orthogonal states, the orbital angular momentum (OAM) light is widely accepted as a promising carrier for high information multiplexing in optical communications, in which the OAM detection is an important issue. To keep up with the ever-growing demand for compact integration, here, a plasmonic grating is employed to spatially couple the OAM modes into two separated propagating surface plasmon polariton (SPP) beams with different splitting angles. These splitting angles are found to strongly rely on the topological charges of the incident beams and are insensitive to the specific location of the OAM beam illumination, which provides an intuitive detection of the OAM modes without particular alignment. Besides, a further unidirectional SPP launching from the OAM beam is also achieved by a particular composite grating. With such composite grating, both the topological charge value and sign of OAM beam in a single measurement can be detected. Our results provide a convenient method for alignment-free OAM detection by a compact device, and would inspire more multiplexing applications in nanophotonics.

ABSTRACT: Acoustic topological insulators that lead to backscattering-immune edge states provide an important way to control and manipulate the behaviors of phonons. To date, most of these acoustic systems are based on single-particle Hamiltonians that conserve particle number. Here, we exploit particle-nonconserving phonon-photon interactions to engineer not only the band structure but also the dissipation of acoustic waves. We find a topologically protected edge state for phonons that can be parametrically amplified while all the bulk modes remain stable. This phenomenon can be exploited to realize topologically protected nonreciprocal traveling-wave amplification for phonons, which may find wide applications in classical and quantum acoustics.

ABSTRACT: Electromagnetic multipoles have been broadly adopted as a fundamental language throughout photonics, of which general features such as radiation patterns and polarization distributions are generically known, while their singularities and topological properties have mostly been left unattended. Here we map all the singularities of multipolar radiations of different orders, identify their indices, and show explicitly that the index sum over the entire momentum sphere is always 2, consistent with the Poincare-Hopf theorem. Upon those revealed properties, we attribute the formation of bound states in the continuum to the overlapping of multipolar singularities with open radiation channels. This insight unveils a subtle equivalence between indices of multipolar singularities and topological charges of those bound states. Our work has fused two fundamental and sweeping concepts of multipoles and topologies, which can potentially bring unforeseen opportunities for many multipole-related fields within and beyond photonics.

ABSTRACT: Synthetic dimension opens new horizons in quantum physics and topological photonics by enabling new dimensions for field and particle manipulations. The most appealing property of the photonic synthetic dimension is its ability to emulate high-dimensional optical behavior in a unitary physical system. Here we show that the photonic synthetic dimension can transform technical problems in photonic systems between dimensionalities, providing unexpected solutions to technical problems that are otherwise challenging. Specifically, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a fully reconfigurable photonic Galton board (PGB) in the temporal synthetic dimension, in which the temporal high-speed challenge is translated into a spatial fiber-optic length matching problem, leading to the generation of tera-sample-per-second arbitrary waveforms with ultimate flexibility. In the experiments, an arbitrary waveform with a widely tunable sampling rate, ranging from 10.42 GSa/s to a record high of 1.64 TSa/s, is demonstrated. The concept of dimension conversion offers possible solutions to various physical dimension-related problems, such as super-resolution imaging, high-resolution spectroscopy, and high-precision time measurement. Synthetic dimensions have drawn a lot of attention in photonics recently, where many physical phenomena have been explored. This work, on the other hand, utilizes the temporal synthetic dimension to solve a technical problem that is otherwise challenging, and showcases the generation of tera-sample-per-second arbitrary waveforms with extreme flexibility, which offers new possible solutions in many application-related problems.

ABSTRACT: Topology-driven nonlinear light-matter effects open up new paradigms for both topological photonics and nonlinear optics. Here, we propose to achieve high-efficiency second harmonic generation in a second-order photonic topological insulator. Such a system hosts highly localized topological corner states with large quality factors for both fundamental and second harmonic waves, which could be matched perfectly in frequency by simply tuning the structural parameters. Through the nonlinear interaction of the doubly resonant topological corner states, unprecedented frequency conversion efficiency is predicted. In addition, the robustness of the nonlinear process against defects is also demonstrated. Our work opens up avenues toward topologically protected nonlinear frequency conversion using high-order photonic topological modes.

ABSTRACT: Electromagnetic multipoles serve as one of the most ubiquitous languages in photonics, forming a complete expansion basis for radiations of arbitrary types. Electromagnetic multipoles from the perspective of line fields and singularities are explored. It is then discovered that, for arbitrary finite sources in a homogeneous background, there have to be isolated directions along which the radiation is either zero or circularly polarized. For such singular directions, half-integer Hopf indices can be assigned and the index sum has to be a global invariant of 2. With this topological insight, the hidden dimensions of radiative circularly polarized Bloch modes of photonic crystal slabs are unveiled, revealing their topological origins of line singularities and indices. This work has established subtle connections between three seemingly unrelated but sweeping physical entities (line singularities of Hopf indices, electromagnetic multipoles, and Bloch modes), which can nourish new frames of visions and applications fertilizing many related fields.

ABSTRACT: The simultaneous control of the spin and orbital angular momentum of light beams has attracted considerable interest from researchers. While some reports have explored this topic in the microwave band, studies focusing on the optical terahertz band remain scarce. Furthermore, most devices operating in the terahertz band tend to have larger profiles and narrower bandwidths. This research presents a terahertz folded transmitarray that enables the simultaneous manipulation of the spin angular momentum, orbital angular momentum, and beam deflection direction of terahertz light waves. The device has an overall profile of approximately one-third of the focal length and operates within a relative bandwidth of 18.2%. The proposed device has promising potential in the field of high-performance information technology.

ABSTRACT: Antimony chalcogenides (Sb2S3-xSex), as one of the promising light-absorbing materials in optoelectronic energy storage devices, has attracted widespread attention in recent years. Of particular note, its crystal structure consists of the one-dimensional [Sb4S(Se)6]n ribbons with efficient carrier transport efficiency along the [hk1] direction. In this paper, with the aid of the topological transformation of the layered material Bi2O2S, the SbBiS3-xSex bimetallic alloy with 2D skeleton structure was induced to grow in situ, and the conversion of Sb2S3-xSex preferred orientation from [hk0] to [hk1] was realized. The corresponding results showed that 2D skeleton structure was conducive to the construction of photo traps and the increase of electrochemical specific surface area. In addition, Bi2O2S acted as an electron transport layer (ETL) to further promote the migration of photo-generated carriers. At 1.23 V vs. RHE, the photocurrent density of quasi-two-dimensional Bi2O2S/SbBiS3-xSex nanosheet photoanode was as high as 6.41 mA cm-2, which was 7.5 times that of pure Sb2S3-xSex, and the peak value of IPCE could reach 40.93%. This work undoubtedly opens up a new avenue for the designing high-efficiency antimony chalcogenides photoelectrodes.

ABSTRACT: The degenerately doped sesquichalcogenide Bi2Te3, a well-known thermoelectric material, has attracted much attention in recent years as a topological insulator in which conducting surface states lead to exotic electronic transport. Here we report the observation of anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) and planar Hall effect (PHE) in polycrystalline thin films of Bi2Te3 over a broad range of temperature and magnetic field strength. The values of AMR, PHE and the Hall mobility (mu H) are compared with results of similar measurements on single crystals and epitaxial films of Bi2Te3, where these properties are understood in the framework of electronic transport in the topologically protected conducting surface states. Our textured polycrystalline films show a robust metallic character with a carrier density (ns) and mobility mu H of 9x1020 cm-3 and 16.7 cm2V- 1s- 1 respectively. This carrier density is higher and the mobility lower by an order of magnitude compared to the reported values of ns and mu H in epitaxial films and single crystals. However, we see a comparable AMR and PHE in our films for which the concept of conducting surface states is ill-defined due to their polycrystallinity and disordered structure. We suggest that an anisotropic backscattering of charge carriers in the strongly spin - orbit coupled electronic states of this heavy-metal-based non-magnetic compound may lead to the measured resistivity anisotropy. The observation of AMR and PHE in polycrystalline films may be important for scalable production of Bi2Te3 based AMR and PHE sensors of magnetic fields.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics provides a powerful platform to explore topological physics beyond traditional electronic materials and shows promising applications in light transport and lasers. Classical degrees of freedom are routinely used to construct topological light modes in real or synthetic dimensions. Beyond the classical topology, the inherent quantum nature of light provides a wealth of fundamentally distinct topological states. Here we implement experiments on topological states of quantized light in a superconducting circuit, with which one- and two-dimensional Fock-state lattices are constructed. We realize rich topological physics including topological zero-energy states of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, strain-induced pseudo-Landau levels, valley Hall effect, and Haldane chiral edge currents. Our study extends the topological states of light to the quantum regime, bridging topological phases of condensed-matter physics with circuit quantum electrodynamics, and offers a freedom in controlling the quantum states of multiple resonators.

ABSTRACT: The exploration of quantum-inspired symmetries in optical and photonic systems has witnessed immense research interest both fundamentally and technologically in a wide range of subject areas in physics and engineering. One of the principal emerging fields in this context is non-Hermitian physics based on parity-time symmetry, originally proposed in the studies pertaining to quantum mechanics and quantum field theory and recently ramified into a diverse set of areas, particularly in optics and photonics. The intriguing physical effects enabled by non-Hermitian physics and PT symmetry have enhanced significant application prospects and engineering of novel materials. In addition, there has been increasing research interest in many emerging directions beyond optics and photonics. Here, the state-of-the art developments in the field of complex non-Hermitian physics based on PT symmetry in various physical settings are brought together, and key concepts, a background, and a detailed perspective on new emerging directions are described. It can be anticipated that this trendy field of interest will be indispensable in providing new perspectives in maneuvering the flow of light in the diverse physical platforms in optics, photonics, condensed matter, optoelectronics, and beyond, and will offer distinctive application prospects in novel functional materials.

ABSTRACT: The geometric properties of energy bands underlie fascinating phenomena in many systems, including solid-state, ultracold gases and photonics. The local geometric characteristics such as the Berry curvature(1) can be related to global topological invariants such as those classifying the quantum Hall states or topological insulators. Regardless of the band topology, however, any non-zero Berry curvature can have important consequences, such as in the semi-classical evolution of a coherent wavepacket. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that the wavepacket dynamics can be used to directly map out the Berry curvature. To this end, we use optical pulses in two coupled fibre loops to study the discrete time evolution of a wavepacket in a one-dimensional geometric 'charge' pump, where the Berry curvature leads to an anomalous displacement of the wavepacket. This is both the first direct observation of Berry curvature effects in an optical system, and a proof-of-principle demonstration that wavepacket dynamics can serve as a high-resolution tool for mapping out geometric properties.

ABSTRACT: Polarization arbitrary manipulated terahertz (THz) pulses with a prescribed amplitude temporal evolution and deposited electric-field vectors can promote many disruptive technologies and enable enormous applications in polarization-sensitive THz spectroscopy and imaging, ultrafast THz optospintronics, information encryption, and space exploration. However, the severe shortage of dynamically tunable THz polarization devices has impeded the proliferation of THz science and technology. Herein, a method of efficient generation and arbitrary manipulation of chiral THz waves in the topological insulator (TI)-iron (Fe) heterostructures through delicately engineering the linear photogalvanic effect (LPGE) and spin-to-charge conversion (SCC) effect induced by femtosecond laser pulses is proposed and demonstrated. Utilizing the intrinsic merits of optical-controlled LPGE and magnetic field direction-adjusted SCC effect, the TI-Fe can radiate chiral THz waves with arbitrarily tailored chirality and ellipticity. To verify the capability of such a novel chiral THz source, helical substructure associates THz circular dichroism spectroscopy is implemented on several (bio)materials, exemplified by the beetle exoskeletons. Furthermore, ultrafast switching between two THz chirality states can be realized by a double-pulse excitation scheme. Such versatile chiral THz emitters with high efficiency and easy integration may have some disruptive applications.

ABSTRACT: "Housed within the 11-stranded beta-barrel of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) is the arylideneimidazolidinone (AMI) chromophore, the component responsible for fluorescence. This class of small-molecule chromophore has drawn significant attention for its remarkable photophysical and photochemical properties, both within the intact protein and after its denaturation. All of the proteins so far Isolated that have visible light fluorescence have been found to contain an AMI chromophore. These proteins comprise an extensive rainbow, ranging from GFP, which contains the simplest chromophore, p-hydroxybenzylideneimidazolidinone (p-HOBDI), to proteins having molecules with longer conjugation lengths and a variety of intraprotein interactions. The fluorescence invariably almost vanishes upon removal of the protective beta-barrel. The role of the barrel in hindering internal conversion has been the subject of numerous studies, especially in our laboratories and those of our collaborators. A better understanding of these chromophores has been facilitated by the development of numerous synthetic protocols. These syntheses, which commonly use the Erlenmeyer azlactone method, have evolved in recent years with the development of a [2 + 3] cycloaddition exploited In our laboratory. The synthetic AMI chromophores have allowed delineation of the complex photophysics of GFP and its derivatives. Upon denaturation, AMI chromophores are marked by 4 orders of magnitude of diminution in emission quantum yield (EQY). This result is attributed to internal conversion resulting from conformational freedom in the released chromophore, which is not allowed within the restrictive beta-barrel. To date, the photophysical properties of the AMI chromophore remain elusive and have been attributed to a variety of mechanisms, including cis-trans isomerization, triplet formation, hula twisting, and proton transfer. Advanced studies involving gas-phase behavior, solvent effects, and protonation states have significantly increased our understanding of the chromophore photophysics, but a comprehensive picture is only slowly emerging. Most importantly, mechanisms in structurally defined chromophores may provide dues as to the origin of the blinking behavior of the fluorescent proteins themselves. One approach to examining the effect of conformational freedom on rapid internal conversion of the chromophores is to restrict the molecules, both through structural modifications and through adjustments of the supramolecular systems. We thus include here a discussion of studies involving the crystalline state, inclusion within natural protein-binding pockets, complexation with metal ions, and sequestration within synthetic cavities  all of this research affirms the role of restricting conformational freedom in partially restoring the EQY. Additionally, new photochemistry is observed within these restricted systems. Many of the studies carried out in our laboratories show promise for these molecules to be adapted as molecular probes, wherein inclusion turns on the fluorescence and provides a signaling mechanism. In this Account, we present an overview of the AMI chromophores, including synthesis, overall photophysics, and supramolecular behavior. A significant amount of work remains for researchers to fully understand the properties of these chromophores, but important progress achieved thus far in photophysics and photochemistry is underscored here."

ABSTRACT: "A geometrical and topological analysis has been performed, and self-assembly of the crystal structures of intermetallic compounds formed in the Na-M (M = K, Cs, Ba, Ag, Pt, Au, Zn, Bi, Sb) systems has been simulated using computer methods (the ToposPro software). The NakMn precursor metal clusters of the crystal structures are determined based on the algorithms of structural-graph decomposition in cluster structures and construction of the basic net of the structure in the form of a graph whose nodes correspond to the cluster centers.

ABSTRACT: The topology of surface plasmon polariton fields (SPPs) with orbital angular momentum (OAM) is characterized by the winding numbers of the phase singularities in the field, also known as topological charges. Using theoretical expressions for the surface plasmon fields, we identify the phase singularities as points where the field is zero and investigate their properties for both integer and noninteger, or fractional, orbital angular momentum. The phase singularities act as vortex centers for the rotating fields. We analyze the behavior of the vortex-antivortex pairs and the breakup of the central vortex and discuss their influence on the measured topology as the orbital angular momentum changes from one integer value l to the next l +1 via the fractional states. Our work highlights the fact that measures of the topological charges do not always equate with the orbital angular momentum and shows how the topology can change discontinuously, even though all of the parameters controlling the fields change smoothly.

ABSTRACT: "Floquet topological systems exhibit rich physics associated with quasienergy band structures and new topological states  nevertheless, they are usually explored in Hermitian systems. Recent studies have shown the capability of non-Hermiticity in engineering topological states, while the interplay of Floquet topological phases and non-Hermiticity remains unclear. Here, we reveal that the non-Hermitian modulation can induce the phase transitions between trivial and nontrivial topological Floquet states. Our study theoretically predicts that the non-Hermitian modulation can create a Floquet pi mode in an originally topological trivial system according to the reopening of quasienergy band gap (i.e., the pi gap), which is well confirmed experimentally in the silicon waveguide platform. Our approach shows the powerful capability of non-Hermitian modulation in engineering topological modes in Floquet photonics systems and would inspire different possibilities in optical field manipulation in open systems."

ABSTRACT: Terahertz radiation refers to a broad electromagnetic spectrum range between microwave and infrared waves, which is also known as the terahertz gap due to inadequate materials and technologies for its generation and manipulation. Atomically thin two dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene, black phosphorus (BP) and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) provide a powerful platform for manipulation of the propagation and detection of terahertz waves. Furthermore, hybrid metamaterials that feature the combination of artificially engineered metamaterials and 2D materials greatly facilitate the dynamic modulation or manipulation of THz radiation towards novel terahertz applications. Herein, we review recent progress in 2D materials in the terahertz domain and hybrid metamaterials with engineered functionalities through the incorporation of graphene, TMDs and BP. The emerging THz devices based on the modulation, nonlinearity, filtering, and plasmonics of 2D materials and metamaterials will be highlighted, and a brief discussion with perspectives and the remaining challenges will be concluded.

ABSTRACT: Optical vortices, beams with spiral wavefronts and screw phase dislocations, have been attracting increasing interest in various fields. Here, we theoretically propose and experimentally realize an easy approach to generating optical vortices. We leverage the inherent momentum-space topological vortex-like response of polarization (strong polarization anisotropy) around bound states in the continuum of two-dimensional periodic structures, for example photonic crystal slabs, to induce Pancharatnam-Berry phases and spin-orbit interaction in the beams. This new class of optical vortex generators operates in momentum space, meaning that the structure is almost homogeneous without a real-space centre. In principle, any even-order optical vortex that is a diffraction-resistant high-order quasi-Bessel beam can be achieved at any desired working wavelength. The proposed approach expands the application of bound states in the continuum and topological photonics. Optical vortices can be generated by applying the winding behaviour of resonances in the momentum space of a photonic crystal slab, which naturally exists and is associated with bound states in the continuum, to modify the phase front of a beam.

ABSTRACT: Probing the center-of-mass of an ultracold atomic cloud can be used to measure Chern numbers, the topological invariants underlying the quantum Hall effects. In this work, we show how such center-of-mass observables can have a much richer dependence on topological invariants than previously discussed. In fact, the response of the center of mass depends not only on the current density, typically measured in a solid-state system, but also on the particle density, which itself can be sensitive to the topology of the band structure. We apply a semiclassical approach, supported by numerical simulations, to highlight the key differences between center-of-mass responses and more standard conductivity measurements. We illustrate this by analyzing both the two- and four-dimensional quantum Hall effects. These results have important implications for experiments in engineered topological systems, such as ultracold gases and photonics.

ABSTRACT: We develop the theoretical framework of nonequilibrium ultrafast photonics in monolayer quantum spin Hall insulators supporting a multitude of topological states. In these materials, ubiquitous strong light-matter interactions in the femtosecond scale lead to nonadiabatic quantum dynamics, resulting in topology-dependent nonlinear optoelectronic transport phenomena. We investigate the mechanism driving topological Dirac fermions interacting with strong ultrashort light pulses and uncover various experimentally accessible physical quantities that encode fingerprints of the quantum material's topological electronic state from the high-harmonic generated spectrum. Our work sets the theoretical cornerstones to realize the full potential of time-resolved harmonic spectroscopy for understanding nonequilibrium processes in quantum topological systems and identifying topological invariants in two-dimensional quantum spin Hall solid state systems.

ABSTRACT: The Q-switched pulse and mode-locked pulse were investigated in an all-normal dispersion Yb-doped fiber laser (YDFL) based on the topological insulators (Tls) with mixing of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to produce Bi2Se3/PVA film or deposition on the end facet of fiber to manufacture TI-compatible fiber. Through the dark Bi2Se3/PVA films with large nonsaturable loss, the YDFL was operated in the Q-switched state. The repetition rate and the duration of the Q-switched pulses increased and declined, respectively, with the pump power to show 2.2 mu s duration and 137.8 kHz repetition rate at the highest pump power. Moreover, the mode-locked pulses, with a 16 MHz repetition rate and 380 ps pulsewidth, were generated at high pump power by using the light Bi2Se3 /PVA film. By means of a Bi2Se3 compatible fiber, through optical deposition of the Bi2Se3 nanoplatelets on the end facet of the fiber, the mode-locked YDFL was generated at low-threshold pump power and revealed more stabilized operation state up to two hours.

ABSTRACT: Synthetic photonic materials created by engineering the profile of refractive index or gain/loss distribution, such as negative-index metamaterials or parity-time-symmetric structures, can exhibit electric and magnetic properties that cannot be found in natural materials, allowing for photonic devices with unprecedented functionalities. In this article, we discuss two directions along this line-non-Hermitian photonics and topological photonics-and their applications in nonreciprocal light transport when nonlinearities are introduced. Both types of synthetic structures have been demonstrated in systems involving judicious arrangement of optical elements, such as optical waveguides and resonators. They can exhibit a transition between different phases by adjusting certain parameters, such as the distribution of refractive index, loss, or gain. The unique features of such synthetic structures help realize nonreciprocal optical devices with high contrast, low operation threshold, and broad bandwidth. They provide promising opportunities to realize nonreciprocal structures for wave transport.

ABSTRACT: Spin and field textures define the topology of the electric and magnetic fields in vacuum. These textures can be imposed on matter by light-matter interactions on the nanometer spatial and DC to femtosecond time scales to define the spatial and temporal symmetries of quasiparticle interactions. How to define the topology of thermodynamically evolving or dynamically imposed polaritonic textures is still an open question in applying control parameters such as temperature or phase of structured light. In this Perspective, we specifically consider the spin topology of geometrical plasmonic lattices formed by surface plasmon polariton fields spanning the full range of polygonal symmetries, ranging from the triangular to the circular including the intermediate aperiodic quasicrystalline tilings. Our premise is that the distortion of a triangular or a square lattice into a circular one, without introducing discontinuous geometric change, as by cutting, must preserve the polariton topology. From this perspective, we review the recent studies of stable optical field-induced dynamic quasiparticles with topological spin textures on the nanoscale. Specifically, we draw attention to how the topological spin textures evolve through the continuous deformation of the surface plasmon generating polygon geometries from triangular to circular. The goal of this Perspective is to introduce the topological properties of plasmonic vortices and to expand the discussion and understanding of how their topological spin and field textures dress material properties for exploration of fundamental physics and applications in photonics and spintronics.

ABSTRACT: Liquid crystals have intrigued physicists as a platform that facilitates direct visualization of topological concepts. Here, the theoretical and experimental studies demonstrating that a thin film of a chiral liquid crystal forms topological entities known as half-Skyrmions, swirl-like orientational order that spans the hemisphere of the order parameter space S2/Z2, are reviewed. They appear in the form of a hexagonal lattice or in an isolated manner, accompanied by topological line defects to satisfy topological constraints. Under an optical microscope, half-Skyrmions appear as dark spots, and their hexagonal lattice yields a Kossel diagram comprising a hexagonal arrangement of circular arcs. These experimental observations are corroborated by numerical calculations of the orientational order based on the Landau-de Gennes theory with an orientational order parameter of a second-rank tensor, and construction of its optical images and Kossel diagrams by directly solving Maxwell equations for light wave. A thin film of a chiral liquid crystal thus provides an interesting system for the investigation of topological concepts, and spontaneous formation of a half-Skyrmion lattice whose periodicity is of the order of the wavelength of visible light has a potential for photonics applications as well as poses a challenging problem on optics.

ABSTRACT: Recently, the method of multipoint interferometer (MI) was proposed to detect the orbital angular momentum (OAM), which could be used for measuring OAM of light from astronomical sources. However, this method is limit to low topological charge, because the interference pattern can repeat periodically. In order to solve this problem, we proposed an improved multipoint interferometer method (IMI) capable of measuring the OAM of optical vortex with arbitrary topological charge. However, the method of IMI is limited by complex interference patterns detection difficult. To overcome these disadvantages of MI and IMI, we proposed a method called DRI using screen plate with a binary ring slit and two pinholes. This method is demonstrated viability theoretically.

ABSTRACT: Photonic molecules (PMs) are of great interest for, e.g., optical filters/sensors or topological and exceptional-point photonics. A key requirement for their versatile application is the tunability of the PM's coupling strength. This important feature is realized in the here introduced widely and precisely tunable PM on an all-polymeric chip-scale platform. The PM consists of two disk-shaped whispering gallery mode cavities on a liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) substrate. The coupling strength of the PM is controlled via the contraction of the LCE under an external stimulus like local heating. We reveal the reversible (de)coupling via the analysis of laser supermodes emitted from a dye-doped PM. The tunability of the PM's coupling strength is apparent from the pronounced mode splittings observed in single-fiber transmission spectra and is consistent with coupled-mode theory. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of the PM as an add-drop filter with a highly controllable intensity transfer. In this light, our PM on an LCE substrate represents a novel platform system for tunably coupled photonic resonators.

ABSTRACT: The skyrmion number of paraxial optical skyrmions can be defined solely via their polarization singularities and associated winding numbers, using a mathematical derivation that exploits Stokes's theorem. It is demonstrated that this definition provides a robust way to extract the skyrmion number from experimental data, as illustrated for a variety of optical (Neel-type) skyrmions and bimerons and multi-skyrmions. This method generates not only an increase in accuracy, but also provides an intuitive geometrical approach to understanding the topology of such quasi-particles of light and their robustness against smooth transformations.

ABSTRACT: Weyl points, three-dimensional linear bulk bands crossings possessing intrinsic helicities, are counterparts of magnetic monopoles in the momentum space. One of the most important features of Weyl semimetals is the presence of topologically protected non-trivial surface states at the boundary that connect between Weyl points of opposite charges. In condensed matter physics, these surface states are called Fermi arcs whose length measures the topological strength of the system. Here we theoretically show that photonic Fermi arcs' can exist at the interface between two magnetized plasma under static bias magnetic fields of different orientations, i.e. a twisted configuration, whereas the length of the Fermi arcs' can be arbitrarily stretched by varying the relative orientation and intensities of two static bias magnetic fields. Interestingly, the Fermi arcs' join two Weyl points of the same sign but residing on different side of the interface. Our work gives insight to the connectivity of Fermi arcs' between two topological semimetals and could open gateway towards tunable photonic topological systems.

ABSTRACT: Wave trapping and manipulation are at the heart of modern integrated photonics and acoustics. Grand challenges emerge on increasing the integration density and reducing the wave leakage/noises due to fabrication imperfections, especially for waveguides and cavities at subwavelength scales. The rising of robust wave dynamics based on topological mechanisms offers possible solutions. Ideally, in a three-dimensional (3D) topological integrated chip, there are coexisting robust two-dimensional (2D) interfaces, one-dimensional (1D) waveguides and zero-dimensional (0D) cavities. Here, we report the experimental discovery of such a dimensional hierarchy of the topologically-protected 2D surface states, 1D hinge states and 0D corner states in a single 3D system. Such an unprecedented phenomenon is triggered by the higher-order topology in simple-cubic sonic crystals and protected by the space group P-m3m. Our study opens up a new regime for multidimensional wave trapping and manipulation at subwavelength scales, which may inspire future technology for integrated acoustics and photonics.

ABSTRACT: In recent years, photonics has proven itself as an excellent platform for emulation of relativistic phenomena. Here, we show an example of relativistic-like trapping in photonic system that realizes Dirac-like dispersion with spatially inhomogeneous mass term. The modes trapped by such cavities, their energy levels, and corresponding orbitals are then characterized through optical imaging in real and momentum space. The fabricated cavities host a hierarchy of photonic modes with distinct radiation profiles directly analogous to various atomic orbitals endowed with unique characteristics, such as pseudo-particle-hall symmetry and spin degeneracy, and they carry topological charge which gives rise to radiative profiles with angular momentum. We demonstrate that these modes can be directionally excited by pseudo-spin-polarized boundary states. In addition to the fundamental interest in the structure of these pseudo-relativistic orbitals, the proposed system offers a route for designing new types of nanophotonic devices, spin-full resonators and topological light sources compatible with integrated photonics platforms.

ABSTRACT: Topological phases exhibit some of the most striking phenomena in modern physics. Much of the rich behaviour of quantum Hall systems, topological insulators, and topological superconductors can be traced to the existence of robust bound states at interfaces between different topological phases. This robustness has applications in metrology and holds promise for future uses in quantum computing. Engineered quantum systems-notably in photonics, where wavefunctions can be observed directly-provide versatile platforms for creating and probing a variety of topological phases. Here we use photonic quantum walks to observe bound states between systems with different bulk topological properties and demonstrate their robustness to perturbations-a signature of topological protection. Although such bound states are usually discussed for static (time-independent) systems, here we demonstrate their existence in an explicitly time-dependent situation. Moreover, we discover a new phenomenon: a topologically protected pair of bound states unique to periodically driven systems.

ABSTRACT: A wideband-tunable Q-switched fiber laser with a high-reflective topological insulator saturable absorber mirror (TISAM) was proposed and experimentally demonstrated. The proposed TISAM is composed of Sb2Te3 and gold films deposited over the fiber tip, and it has the advantage of compact size, easy integration over fiber, good stability, and mass production ability. The modulation depth, saturable intensity, and nonsaturable loss of the TISAM at 1550 nm are experimentally tested to be 6.2%, 143 MW/cm(2), and 4.2%, respectively. By using such TISAM, we obtain laser pulses of similar to 400 ns in pulse width and kHz in repetition rates over the wavelength range from 1530 to 1570 nm. The experimental results indicate that the Sb2Te3 based TISAM have good potentials for Q-switched fiber lasers.

ABSTRACT: The light field structure on diffraction of a circular segment-shaped laser beam was studied. At distances of 6-20 cm from a segment-shaped aperture obstructing a circular laser beam, the formation of the beam structure propagating in a slow-expansion mode was detected. The diffracted beam structure has been fully formed in the shadow region at a distance of 20 cm from the obstacle. In the boundary region of the aperture straight edge, the helical beams of the opposite topological charges were reconstructed by the theoretical 3-D propagation of the laser beam.

ABSTRACT: Easy-to-craft photonic crystals enabling frequency-isolated Weyl points, especially at visible wavelengths, are yet to be developed. To this end, we exploited double gyroid (DG) crystals with Parity (P)-breaking and nanoscale unit cells, which are readily compatible with currently accessible interference lithography (IL). By modulating a level-set equation, we designed the D-2-symmetric single gyroid (SG), perturbed from an O-symmetric SG, and found that the DG crystals, consisting of D-2- and O-symmetric SGs with opposite chirality, can exhibit frequency-isolated Weyl points. As a route to the fabrication of the designed P-breaking DG crystals with a nanoscale unit cell, the IL condition was defined in terms of (i) wavenumbers of multiple beams and (ii) their own complex electric fields. Our lithographically designed nanoscale DG crystals, even with a practical material condition, exhibited the Weyl points whose wavelengths were totally separated from other neighboring bands. Given the established design strategy suitable for a practical processing (e.g., IL), we have provided a viable route for on-chip integration of such Weyl materials, enabling topologically nontrivial surface states.

ABSTRACT: We report a valley photonic crystal (VPhC) waveguide in a GaAs slab with InAs quantum dots (ODs) as an internal light source exploited for the experimental characterization of the waveguide. A topological interface state formed at the interface between two topologically-distinct VPhCs is used as the waveguide mode. We demonstrate robust propagation for the near-infrared light emitted from the QDs, even with the presence of sharp bends, due to the topological protection of the guided mode. Our work will be of importance for developing robust photonic integrated circuits with small footprints, as well as for exploring active semiconductor topological photonics.

ABSTRACT: We investigate a multispiral phase plate (MSPP) with multiple centers of phase singularity arbitrarily located in the MSPP plane. Equations to describe the topological charge of an optical vortex in the initial plane immediately behind the MSPP and orbital angular momentum (OAM) normalized relative to the beam power are derived. The topological charge in the initial plane is found as a sum of the topological charges of all singularities if their centers are located inside a finite-radius circular aperture. If the phase singularity centers are partially located on the boundary of a circular diaphragm limiting the MSPP, the total topological charge is found as the sum of all singularities divided by 2. Total OAM that the vortex carries depends on the location of the singularity centers: the farther from the center of the plate the singularity center is located, the smaller is its contribution to the OAM. If all singularity centers are located on the boundary of the diaphragm limiting MSPP, then the OAM of the vortex beam equals zero, although in this case the topological charge of the beam is nonzero.

ABSTRACT: In this work, we theoretically and numerically show that in the superposition of optical Gaussian vortices with a symmetric OAM spectrum, the normalized orbital angular momentum (OAM) carried by the beam and the topological charge (TC) equal TC of the middle constituent vortex. We also show that after passing a sector-shaped aperture, the symmetric superposition preserves the OAM carried, with the TC becoming fractional and proportional to the angle of the sector aperture. As it further propagates in free space after the sector aperture, the TC of the superposition becomes an integer, albeit indefinite, thanks to the aperture edges generating a multitude of extra optical vortices with positive and negative unit TC, irregularly arranged across the beam.

ABSTRACT: The highly localized and uneven spatial distribution of the subwavelength light field in metal metasurfaces provides a promising means for the generation of optical vortices (OVs) with arbitrary topological charges. In this paper, a simple and reliable way for generating multichannel OVs on gold nanoporous metasurfaces is reported. The instantaneous field of arbitrary-order OVs can be regulated and concentrated on the same focal surface by adapting photonic spin-orbit interaction (SOI) and geometric phase. The focal ring energy distribution of OVs along the conical propagation path is accurately calculated, and the double phase of units induced by spin rotation is confirmed. Based on the parameter optimization of the nanohole arrangement, the simultaneous amplitude and phase modulation of multichannel OVs has been realized. Furthermore, the average multichannel signal-to-noise ratio exceeds 15 dB, which meets the requirements of high resolution and low crosstalk. Our study obtains broadband and efficient OVs, which can contribute to improving the capacity storage and security of optical information and possess great application prospects in beam shaping, optical tweezers, and communication coding.

ABSTRACT: Using a FDTD-method implemented in the FullWAVE (RSoft) software, a process of generating optical vortices during the propagation of a left-or right-hand circularly polarized Gaussian pulse through a phase and amplitude spiral zone plate with topological charge 2, a diameter of 8 mu m, and a focal length of 532 nm is numerically modeled. An investigation of the amplitude and phase distributions in the focal plane shows the presence of optical vortices with topological charge 2. Analysis of the longitudinal component of the Umov-Poynting vector shows the presence of an inverse energy flow in the focal plane. In the case of using an amplitude spiral zone plate, the magnitude of the reverse flow decreases sharply until it disappears completely for the left circularly polarized incident beams.

ABSTRACT: We describe how the transformation-optics technique can be used to design an effective medium mimicking the conical curvature singularity. Anholonomic coordinate transformation gives rise to linear topological defects that break the rotational symmetry. The bending and splitting of the optical beams are found analytically and numerically, depending on the incident direction and the topological charge. Beyond their practical applications to omnidirectional beam steering for photonics, our findings set forth an attractive realm to simulate the relevant physical phenomena in the optical laboratory.

ABSTRACT: The interactions between different types of colloidal particles are measured and analyzed. We use these interactions to build different self-assembled microstructures, such as dimers, chains, wires, crystals and superstructures. In the experiments we have used different size, different symmetry of colloids (elastic dipoles and quadrupoles) and different way of colloidal binding (via localized defects and via entangled defects). We use optical tweezers for directed self-assembly of colloidal particles. Special attention is devoted to the hierarchical superstructures of large and small particles. We show that smaller, submicron colloidal particles are trapped into the topological defect rings or loops, twisting around larger colloidal particles, which are sources of strong nematic deformations. Various possible applications are discussed, especially in photonics and metamaterials.

ABSTRACT: Edge states emerge in diverse areas of science, offering promising opportunities for the development of future electronic or optoelectronic devices, sound and light propagation control in acoustics and photonics. Previous experiments on edge states in photonics were carried out mostly in linear regimes, but the current belief is that nonlinearity introduces more striking features into physics of edge states, leading to the formation of edge solitons, optical isolation, making possible stable lasing in such states, to name a few. Here we report the observation of edge solitons at the zigzag edge of a reconfigurable photonic graphene lattice created via the effect of electromagnetically induced transparency in an atomic vapor cell with controllable nonlinearity. To obtain edge solitons, Raman gain is introduced to compensate strong absorption experienced by the edge state during propagation. Our observations may open the way for future experimental exploration of topological photonics on this nonlinear, reconfigurable platform.

ABSTRACT: Spiral phase plate (SPP) is the widely used method in the generation of vortex beam (VB) with fixed topological charges (TCs) for specific wavelength. Although VB with large TCs can be directly generated by using the SPP with high vortex order. The fabrication of high-quality SPPs with high vortex orders usually requires complex manufacturing process and high machining accuracy. An alternative method to generate VBs with large TCs is cascaded multiple SPPs with low order. In this study, we numerically calculate the transmitted light field of cascaded multiple SPPs according to the Huygens-Fresnel diffraction integral, and perform the experimental verifications. Based on cascading 6 SPPs (3 SPPs with TCs of 2, and 3 SPPs with TCs 4, respectively), an VB with TCs as high as 18 is generated. Furthermore, The TCs of the generated VB are detected by coaxial and off-axis interfering with fundamental Gaussian beam or its conjugate beam, respectively. The generated fork and spiral patterns allow us to distinguish the value and sign of TCs carried by the VB. The experimental results coincide well with the theoretical simulations. The fork pattern shows better resolution than the spiral one, and the petal pattern with small spiral allows us to distinguish large TCs with a higher resolution.

ABSTRACT: "Engineeringthe dispersion of light in a metasurface allows forcontrolling the light-matter interaction strength between lightconfined in the metasurface and materials placed within its near-field.Specifically, engineering a flatband dispersion increases the photonicdensity of states, thereby enhancing the light-matter interaction.Here, we experimentally demonstrate a metasurface with a flat dispersionat visible wavelengths. We designed and fabricated a suspended one-dimensionalgallium phosphide metasurface and measured the photonic band structurevia energy-momentum spectroscopy, observing a photonic band that isflat over 10 & DEG  of half angle at & SIM 590 nm.

ABSTRACT: The field of two-dimensional (2D) materials-based nanophotonics has been growing at a rapid pace, triggered by the ability to design nanophotonic systems with in situ control, unprecedented number of degrees of freedom, and to build material heterostructures from the bottom up with atomic precision. A wide palette of polaritonic dasses have been identified, comprising ultraconfined optical fields, even approaching characteristic lengthscales of a single atom. These advances have been a real boost for the emerging field of quantum nanophotonics, where the quantum mechanical nature of the electrons and polaritons and their interactions become relevant. Examples include quantum nonlocal effects, ultrastrong light-matter interactions, Cherenkov radiation, access to forbidden transitions, hydrodynamic effects, single-plasmon nonlinearities, polaritonic quantization, topological effects, and so on. In addition to these intrinsic quantum nanophotonic phenomena, 2D material systems can also be used as sensitive probes for the quantum properties of the material that carries the nanophotonics modes or quantum materials in its vicinity. Here, polaritons act as a probe for otherwise invisible excitations, for example, in superconductors, or as a new tool to monitor the existence of Berry curvature in topological materials and superlattice effects in twisted 2D materials. In this Perspective, we present an overview of the emergent field of 2D-material quantum nanophotonics and provide a future perspective on the prospects of both fundamental emergent phenomena and emergent quantum technologies, such as quantum sensing, single-photon sources, and quantum emitters manipulation. We address four main implications: (i) quantum sensing, featuring polaritons to probe superconductivity and explore new electronic transport hydrodynamic behaviors, (ii) quantum technologies harnessing single-photon generation, manipulation, and detection using 2D materials, (iii) polariton engineering with quantum materials enabled by twist angle and stacking order control in van der Waals heterostructures, and (iv) extreme light-matter interactions enabled by the strong confinement of light at atomic level by 2D materials, which provide new tools to manipulate light fields at the nanoscale (e.g., quantum chemistry, nonlocal effects, high Purcell enhancement).

ABSTRACT: Helical edge states (HESs) in two-dimensional topological spin photonic crystals can be used to realize pseudospin-locked unidirectional propagation of waves. In general, the excitation of HESs is by taking light sources carrying orbital angular momentum of order 1 to stimulate the pseudospin p states in spin photonic crystals. In this paper, we think of the HESs as combinations of the pseudospin p states and the pseudospin d states, which corresponding to the pseudospin modes carrying orbital angular momentum of order 1 and the pseudospin modes carrying orbital angular momentum of order 2, respectively, with their chirality related to the unidirectional propagations of the HESs. By analyzing the field distributions of HESs and via exciting the pseudospin d states with light sources carrying orbital angular momentum of order 2, we demonstrate the unidirectional propagation of the HESs in spin photonic crystals and verify their robustness by checking the unidirectional performance as they propagate along a Z-shape interface containing sharp corners, cavity defect, and disorders. Our study deepens understanding of the nature of HESs and expands methods to excitation and regulation of HESs in topological spin photonics. Published under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing.

ABSTRACT: We show that Weyl points can be realized in all-dielectric superlattices based on three-dimensional (3D) layered photonic crystals. Our approach is based on creating an inversion-breaking array of weakly-coupled planar defects embedded in a periodic layered structure with a large omnidirectional photonic band gap. Using detailed band structure calculations and tight-binding theory arguments, we demonstrate that this class of layered systems can be tailored to display 3D linear point degeneracies between two photonic bands, without breaking time-reversal symmetry and using a configuration that is readily-accessible experimentally. These results open new prospects for the observation of Weyl points in the near-infrared and optical regimes and for the application of Weyl-physics in integrated photonic devices.

ABSTRACT: Photonic graphene, possesses a honeycomb-like geometric structure, provides a superior platform for simulating photonic bandgap, Dirac physics, and topological photonics. Here, the photonic graphene with reconfigurable geometric structures is demonstrated in a 5S(1/2)-5P(3/2)-5D(5/2) cascade-type Rb-85 atomic ensembles. A strong hexagonal-coupling field, formed by the interference of three identical coupling beams, is responsible for optically inducing photonic graphene in atomic vapor. The incident weak probe beam experiences discrete diffraction, and the observed pattern at the output plane of vapor cell exhibits a clear hexagonal intensity distribution. The complete photonic graphene geometries from transversely stretched to longitudinally stretched are conveniently constructed by varying the spatial arrangement of three coupling beams, and the corresponding diffraction patterns are implemented theoretically and experimentally to map these distorted geometric structures. Moreover, the distribution of lattice sites intensity in photonic graphene is further dynamically adjusted by two-photon detuning and the coupling beams power. This work paves the way for further investigation of light transport and graphene dynamics.

ABSTRACT: Investigation of light-matter interactions in two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors is essential to understand many-body effects and explore their applications in photonics. 2D semiconductor microcavities can be formed by the integration of 2D semiconductor active media with planar Fabry-Perot resonant cavities. The emerging exciton-photon interactions between the strongly bound excitons in 2D semiconductors and the cavity photons allow exploring on the wealthy photonic and polaritonic physics of bosonic quasiparticles in the 2D limit. This Perspective focuses on recent advances in exciton-photon interactions of 2D semiconductor microcavities and their inspiring applications. First, we picture the research scope of 2D semiconductor microcavities, sort out the historical development from conventional semiconductor microcavities to the emerged 2D semiconductor microcavities, and illustrate mostly employed device structures. Second, we classify exciton-photon interactions in 2D semiconductor microcavities according to their coupling strengths. In the weak coupling regime, control of spontaneous emission and photon lasing are discussed together with the Purcell effect. In the strong coupling regime, we summarize experimental observations and theoretical predictions on Rabi splitting, Bose-Einstein condensation, polariton lasing, superfluidity, and superconductivity. Third, four types of leading-edge applications are outlined, including on-chip coherent light sources, microcavity-enhanced single-photon sources, topological photonics, and other nonlinear optics. Finally, we highlight the remaining challenges and future opportunities for fundamental physics of 2D semiconductor microcavities and their technological applications.

ABSTRACT: Photonics: Creating the non-Abelian buildings blocks for new photonic devices Modeling the spectral properties of spin-orbit coupled crystals in a magnetic field could lead to new topological phases in matter and lay the foundations for new photonic systems. Synthetic non-Abelian gauge fields have emerged as a new way for studying the topological phases of matter, providing new insights in optics and photonics. However, synthesizing non-Abelian gauge fields has proved very challenging. Now, Yi Yang and colleagues at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in collaboration with a researcher from the University of Pennsylvania, have studied two non-Abelian generalisations of the Hofstadter model, which describes the behaviour of two-dimensional non-interacting electrons in a non-Abelian magnetic field. They proved the genuine non-Abelian conditions and analyze the topological properties of the models. The work could lead to a new way of manipulating light in photonic devices. The Hofstadter model, well known for its fractal butterfly spectrum, describes two-dimensional electrons under a perpendicular magnetic field, which gives rise to the integer quantum Hall effect. Inspired by the real-space building blocks of non-Abelian gauge fields from a recent experiment, we introduce and theoretically study two non-Abelian generalizations of the Hofstadter model. Each model describes two pairs of Hofstadter butterflies that are spin-orbit coupled. In contrast to the original Hofstadter model that can be equivalently studied in the Landau and symmetric gauges, the corresponding non-Abelian generalizations exhibit distinct spectra due to the non-commutativity of the gauge fields. We derive the genuine (necessary and sufficient) non-Abelian condition for the two models from the commutativity of their arbitrary loop operators. At zero energy, the models are gapless and host Weyl and Dirac points protected by internal and crystalline symmetries. Double (8-fold), triple (12-fold), and quadrupole (16-fold) Dirac points also emerge, especially under equal hopping phases of the non-Abelian potentials. At other fillings, the gapped phases of the models give rise to topological insulators. We conclude by discussing possible schemes for experimental realization of the models on photonic platforms.

ABSTRACT: This review aims to provide an overview over recent developments of light-driven currents with a focus on their application to layered van der Waals materials. In topological and spin-orbit dominated van der Waals materials helicity-driven and light-field-driven currents are relevant for nanophotonic applications from ultrafast detectors to onchip current generators. The photon helicity allows addressing chiral and non-trivial surface states in topological systems, but also the valley degree of freedom in two-dimensional van der Waals materials. The underlying spinorbit interactions break the spatiotemporal electrodynamic symmetries, such that directed currents can emerge after an ultrafast laser excitation. Equally, the light-field of few-cycle optical pulses can coherently drive the transport of charge carriers with sub-cycle precision by generating strong and directed electric fields on the atomic scale. Ultrafast light-driven currents may open up novel perspectives at the interface between photonics and ultrafast electronics.

ABSTRACT: Spiral pattern is formed for coaxial interference between two vortex beams with different radii of wavefront curvatures and different topological charges (TCs). A theoretical model considering various parameters (such as phase difference, radius of wavefront curvature, and TCs) is established to predict all kinds of interference patterns. An improved Mach-Zehnder interferometer is set up in an experiment to generate different kinds of spiral patterns and verify the theoretical model. The number of spiral lobes is determined by the absolute value of TCs' difference between two vortex beams, and the twist direction relates to the sign of TCs' difference and the difference of reciprocals for the radii of wavefront curvature, clockwise for the same sign, and counterclockwise for the opposite signs. The twist direction of the spiral pattern reverses and the lobes direction near the core of the pattern changes obviously when the spherical wave changes from convergence to divergence.

ABSTRACT: Spin-orbit coupling of light has come to the fore in nanooptics and plasmonics, and is a key ingredient of topological photonics and chiral quantum optics. We demonstrate a basic tool for incorporating analogous effects into neutron optics: the generation and detection of neutron beams with coupled spin and orbital angular momentum. The He-3 neutron spin filters are used in conjunction with specifically oriented triangular coils to prepare neutron beams with lattices of spin-orbit correlations, as demonstrated by their spin-dependent intensity profiles. These correlations can be tailored to particular applications, such as neutron studies of topological materials.

ABSTRACT: "Topology optimization has been widely adopted in the inverse design of nanophotonic devices due to low computation cost, which unfortunately produces intermediate relative permittivity values that fail to meet fabrication constraints. Additionally, the postprocessing required inevitably increases the complexity of the inverse design. In this Letter, we propose an adaptive projection method for topology optimization, in which a two-level hierarchical hyperbolic tangent projection function with linear increment and differentiation is constructed and applied to eliminate inherent defects of conventional topology optimization. Two binarized nanophotonic devices have been designed by our adaptive projection method, among which one ultra-compact dual 90 & DEG -bend waveguide reduces the average insertion loss to 20.3% of its similar counterpart and shows an 8.1% reduction for the average crosstalk in the O band, the other ultralow-loss waveguide crossing features an average insertion loss as low as 0.09 dB. With the significant advantages of excellent performance guarantee and fabrication-friendly geometry control fully demonstrated, our inverse design solution shows potential to contribute to nanophotonic devices and integrated chips.

ABSTRACT: Scattering immune propagation of light in topological photonic systems may revolutionize the design of integrated photonic circuits for information processing and communications. In optics, various photonic topological circuits have been developed, which were based on classical emulation of either quantum spin Hall effect or quantum valley Hall effect. On the other hand, the combination of both the valley and spin degrees of freedom can lead to a new kind of topological transport phenomenon, dubbed spin-valley Hall effect (SVHE), which can further expand the number of topologically protected edge channels and would be useful for information multiplexing. However, it is challenging to realize SVHE in most known material platforms, due to the requirement of breaking both the (pseudo)fermionic time-reversal (T) and parity symmetries (P) individually, but leaving the combined symmetry S equivalent to TP intact. Here, we propose an experimentally feasible platform to realize SVHE for light, based on coupled ring resonators mediated by optical Kerr nonlinearity. Thanks to the inherent flexibility of cross-mode modulation, the coupling between the probe light can be engineered in a controllable way such that spin-dependent staggered sublattice potential emerges in the effective Hamiltonian. With delicate yet experimentally feasible pump conditions, we show the existence of spin-valley Hall-induced topological edge states. We further demonstrate that both degrees of freedom, i.e., spin and valley, can be manipulated simultaneously in a reconfigurable manner to realize spin-valley photonics, doubling the degrees of freedom for enhancing the information capacity in optical communication systems.

ABSTRACT: We theoretically propose a scheme to produce Weyl points in two-dimensional (2D) optical microdisk-resonator arrays, which undergo a dynamical modulation with temporal periodicity. By mapping the set of modes supported by each resonator to a synthetic frequency dimension, the 2D lattice is equivalent to a three-dimensional (3D) time-independent lattice. We show that, by breaking the inversion symmetry (I symmetry) or introducing artificial gauge fields, Weyl points can be formed, leading to anomalous topological edge states and Fermi arcs. This approach may provide a way to design robust topological photonic devices on chips and future applications for integrated photonics.

ABSTRACT: Inter-satellite laser communication can fulfill the requirements of huge-capacity transmission of satellite communication. The space-wide alloptical network is a key way to solve problems such as low-latency, hugecapacity transmission and low-cost on-orbit real-time route switching processing through technologies of Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) intersatellite links (ISLs) and wavelength routing. Then routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) become its core and main technology. Aiming at the RWA issue, this paper takes the typical LEO satellite constellations Iridium and NeLS as examples, establishes a regular ISLs topology, and proposes a simulation model based on the minimum cost routing strategy and wavelength demand. The results of simulations demonstrate that, compared with the link arbitrary topology, the NeLS constellation with regular network topology can save nearly half of the wavelength resource requirement under the condition of slightly sacrificing node connectivity, and the Iridium constellation has the better connectivity with the same wavelength resource demand. Both NeLS and Iridium constellations show a more stable trend in the link duration, wavelength volatility, and node connectivity volatility.

ABSTRACT: We reveal the emergence of quantum Hall phases, topological edge states, spectral Landau levels, and Hofstadter butterfly spectra in the two-particle Hilbert space of an array of periodically spaced two-level atoms coupled to a waveguide (waveguide quantum electrodynamics). While the topological edge states of photons require fine-tuned spatial or temporal modulations of the parameters to generate synthetic magnetic fields and the quantum Hall effect, here we demonstrate that a synthetic magnetic field can be self-induced solely by atom-photon interactions. The fact that topological order can be self-induced in what is arguably the simplest possible quantum structure shows the richness of these waveguide quantum electrodynamics systems. We believe that our findings will advance several research disciplines including quantum optics, many-body physics, and nonlinear topological photonics, and that it will set an important reference point for the future experiments on qubit arrays and quantum simulators.

ABSTRACT: Making analogy with atomic physics is a powerful tool for photonic technology, witnessed by the recent development in topological photonics and non-Hermitian photonics based on parity-time symmetry. The Mollow triplet is a prominent atomic effect with both fundamental and technological importance. Here we demonstrate the analog of the Mollow triplet with quantum photonic systems. Photonic entanglement is generated with spontaneous nonlinear processes in dressed photonic modes, which are introduced through coherent multimode coupling. We further demonstrate the possibility of the photonic system to realize different configurations of dressed states, leading to modification of the Mollow triplet. Our work would enable the investigation of complex atomic processes and the realization of unique quantum functionalities based on photonic systems. (C) 2021 Optical Society of America

ABSTRACT: Phonon polaritons (PhPs).lattice vibrations coupled to electromagnetic fields.in highly anisotropic media display a plethora of intriguing optical phenomena, including ray-like propagation, anomalous refraction, and topological transitions, among others, which have potential for unprecedented manipulation of the flow of light at the nanoscale. However, the properties of these PhPs are intrinsically dictated by the anisotropic crystal structure of the host material. Although in-plane anisotropic PhPs can be steered, and even canalized, by twisting individual crystal slabs in a van der Waals (vdW) stack, active control of their propagation via external stimuli presents a significant challenge. Here, we report on a technology in which anisotropic PhPs supported by biaxial vdW slabs are actively tuned by simply gating an integrated graphene layer. Excitingly, we predict active tuning of optical topological transitions, which enable controlling the canalization of PhPs along different in-plane directions in twisted heterostructures. Apart from their fundamental interest, our findings hold promises for the development of optoelectronic devices (sensors, photodetectors, etc.) based on PhPs with dynamically controllable properties.

ABSTRACT: Structured light provides an additional degree of freedom for modern optics and practical applications. The effective generation of orbital angular momentum ( OAM) lasing, especially at a micro- and nanoscale, could address the growing demand for information capacity. By exploiting the emerging non-Hermitian photonics design at an exceptional point, we demonstrate a microring laser producing a single-mode OAM vortex lasing with the ability to precisely define the topological charge of the OAM mode. The polarization associated with OAM lasing can be further manipulated on demand, creating a radially polarized vortex emission. Our OAM microlaser could find applications in the next generation of integrated optoelectronic devices for optical communications in both quantum and classical regimes.

ABSTRACT: Photonic skyrmions and merons are topological quasiparticles characterized by nontrivial electromagnetic textures, which have received increasing research attention recently, providing novel degree of freedom to manipulate light-matter interactions and exhibiting excellent potential in deep-subwavelength imaging and nanometrology. Here, the topological stability of photonic spin meron lattices, which indicates the invariance of skyrmion number and robustness of spin texture under a continuous deformation of the field configuration, is demonstrated by inducing a perturbation to break the C4 symmetry in the presence spin-orbit coupling in an optical field. We revealed that amplitude perturbation would result in an amplitude-dependent shift of spin center, while phase perturbation leads to the deformation of domain walls, manifesting the metastability of photonic meron. Such spin topology is verified through the interference of plasmonic vortices with a broken rotational symmetry. The results provide new insights on optical topological quasiparticles, which may pave the way towards applications in topological photonics, optical information storage and transfer.

ABSTRACT: Vortex beams' orbital angular momentum (OAM) has important application value in optical communication and other fields. Accurate measurement of their OAM topological charges is required for the application of vortex beams in the field of optical communication. As a type of convolutional neural network, DenseNet which combines the Data Augmentation with Expansion method, was introduced to measure the fractional topological charge of OAM images in the case of few samples. The OAM images used in this paper generally do not have high brightness, which simulates ultra-long-distance transmission situations in reality. The experiment shows that the classification accuracy of DenseNet network reaches 98.77%, with an average training time of about 1100 seconds, which is short. Our results showcase the potential of convolutional neural network approach to further study the OAM light in the application of free-space optical communication.

ABSTRACT: Topological insulators do not allow conduction in the bulk, yet they support edge modes that travel along the boundary only in one direction, determined by the carried electron spin, with inherent robustness to defects and disorder. Topological insulators have inspired analogues in photonics and optics, in which one-way edge propagation in topologically protected two-dimensional materials is achieved breaking time-reversal symmetry with a magnetic bias. Here, we introduce the concept of topological order in classical acoustics, realizing robust topological protection and one-way edge propagation of sound in a suitably designed resonator lattice biased with angular momentum, forming the acoustic analogue of a magnetically biased graphene layer. Extending the concept of an acoustic nonreciprocal circulator based on angular-momentum bias, time-reversal symmetry is broken here using moderate rotational motion of air within each element of the lattice, which takes the role of the electron spin in determining the direction of modal edge propagation.

ABSTRACT: By taking advantage of the optical induction method, a non-Hermitian photonic graphene lattice is efficiently established inside an atomic vapor cell under the condition of electromagnetically induced transparency. This non-Hermitian structure is accomplished by simultaneously modulating both the real and imaginary components of the refractive index into honeycomb profiles. The transmitted probe field can either exhibit a hexagonal or honeycomb intensity profile when the degree of non-Hermiticity is effectively controlled by the ratio between imaginary and real indices. The experimental realization of such an instantaneously tunable complex honeycomb potential sets a new platform for future experimental exploration of non-Hermitian topological photonics. Also, we demonstrate the Talbot effect of the transmitted probe patterns. Such a self-imaging effect based on a non-Hermitian structure provides a promising route to potentially improve the related applications, such as an all-optical-controllable Talbot-Lau interferometer.

ABSTRACT: Silicon-on-insulator (SOI) combined with topological photonics provides on-chip integrated photonic devices CMOS-compatibility and backscattering-suppression. Here we propose a tunable SOI-based valley Hall topological insulator with two nonequivalent air holes to break inversion symmetry. Due to free-carrier excitation, the real and imaginary parts of the refractive index are modified to cause a blue-shift of bandgap and a reduction of transmittance, respectively. Based on this mechanism, we design a tunable all-optical switch with the merits of high transmittance contrast (about 23) and polarization-resolved characteristics simultaneously. Our proposed approach has potential in broadband tunable integrated photonic devices at telecommunication wavelengths.

ABSTRACT: In this article, we develop a unified perspective of unidirectional topological edge waves in nonreciprocal media. We focus on the inherent role of photonic spin in nonreciprocal gyroelectric media, i.e. magnetized metals or magnetized insulators. Due to the large body of contradicting literature, we point out at the outset that these Maxwellian spin waves are fundamentally different from well-known topologically trivial surface plasmon polaritons. We first review the concept of a Maxwell Hamiltonian in nonreciprocal media, which immediately reveals that the gyrotropic coefficient behaves as a photon mass in two dimensions. Similar to the Dirac mass, this photonic mass opens bandgaps in the energy dispersion of bulk propagating waves. Within these bulk photonic bandgaps, three distinct classes of Maxwellian edge waves exist each arising from subtle differences in boundary conditions. On one hand, the edge wave solutions are rigorous photonic analogs of Jackiw-Rebbi electronic edge states. On the other hand, for the exact same system, they can be high frequency photonic counterparts of the integer quantum Hall effect, familiar at zero frequency. Our Hamiltonian approach also predicts the existence of a third distinct class of Maxwellian edge wave exhibiting topological protection. This occurs in an intriguing topological bosonic phase of matter, fundamentally different from any known electronic or photonic medium. The Maxwellian edge state in this unique quantum gyroelectric phase of matter necessarily requires a sign change in gyrotropy arising from nonlocality (spatial dispersion). In a Drude system, this behavior emerges from a spatially dispersive cyclotron frequency that switches sign with momentum. A signature property of these topological electromagnetic edge states is that they are oblivious to the contacting medium, i.e. they occur at the interface of the quantum gyroelectric phase and any medium (even vacuum). This is because the edge state satisfies open boundary conditions - all components of the electromagnetic field vanish at the interface. Furthermore, the Maxwellian spin waves exhibit photonic spin -1 quantization in exact analogy with their supersymmetric spin-1/2 counterparts. The goal of this paper is to discuss these three foundational classes of edge waves in a unified perspective while providing in-depth derivations, taking into account nonlocality and various boundary conditions. Our work sheds light on the important role of photonic spin in condensed matter systems, where this definition of spin is also translatable to topological photonic crystals and metamaterials.

ABSTRACT: We introduce the notion of adiabatic state flip of a Floquet Hamiltonian associated with a non-Hermitian system that it is subjected to two driving schemes with clear separation of time scales. The fast (Floquet) modulation scheme is utilized to reallocate the exceptional points in the parameter space of the system and redefine the topological features of an adiabatic cyclic modulation associated with the slow driving scheme. Such topological reorganization can be used in order to control the adiabatic transport between two eigenmodes of the Floquet Hamiltonian. The proposed scheme provides a degree of reconfigurability of adiabatic state transfer which can find applications in system control in photonics and microwave domains.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics has been introduced as a powerful platform for integrated optics, since it can deal with robust light transport, and be further extended to the quantum world. Strikingly, valley-contrasting physics in topological photonic structures contributes to valley-related edge states, their unidirectional coupling, and even valley-dependent wave division in topological junctions. Here, we design and fabricate nanophotonic topological harpoon-shaped beam splitters (HSBSs) based on 120-deg-bending interfaces and demonstrate the first on-chip valley-dependent quantum information process. Two-photon quantum interference, namely, Hong-Ou-Mandel interference with a high visibility of 0.956 +/- 0.006, is realized with our 50/50 HSBS, which is constructed by two topologically distinct domain walls. Cascading this kind of HSBS together, we also demonstrate a simple quantum photonic circuit and generation of a path-entangled state. Our work shows that the photonic valley state can be used in quantum information processing, and it is possible to realize more complex quantum circuits with valley-dependent photonic topological insulators, which provides a novel method for on-chip quantum information processing.

Recent technological advances in phase and polarization structuring have led to the discovery of additional geometric phases of light. The underlying mechanism for all of these is provided by fiber bundle theory. This Colloquium reviews how fiber bundle theory not only sheds light on the origin of geometric phases of light but also lays the foundations for the exploration of high-dimensional state spaces, with implications for topological photonics and quantum communications."

ABSTRACT: "Magnetic garnets (MG) are insulators with superior magnetic and optical properties, such as high Curie temperature, highly tunable bulk perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), ferrimagnetic nature with low net moment, extremely low Gilbert damping, strong magneto-optic effects, optical nonreciprocity and low optical loss, etc. Consequently, these attributes make them particularly suitable for the applications in the next generation spintronic and photonic devices, which exhibit low energy consumption, room temperature fast operation speed and high integration density.

ABSTRACT: Electromagnetic (EM) skyrmions are an EM analogue of the skyrmions in condensed matter physics, offering new degrees of freedom to structure light and manipulate light-matter interactions and thus promising various groundbreaking applications in optics and photonics. Recently, there is a growing interest in composing EM skyrmions based on different field vectors of EM waves. Here, an EM skyrmion is realized, i.e., a spoof plasmonic skyrmion (SPS), using the electric field vectors of spoof localized surface plasmons (LSPs) in a planar microwave resonator with rotational and mirroring symmetries. The SPS is constructed by synthesizing a scalar vortex (a topological charge 0) and a polarization vortex (a topological charge 1) in the in-plane and the out-of-plane component of the fields, respectively. Besides an experimental demonstration, group theory is employed and pinpoints the symmetry origin of the skyrmion. This investigation demonstrates the ubiquity of the existence of the skyrmion in any planar EM resonator holding rotational and mirroring symmetries, regardless the dimensions and the operating frequencies. This skyrmion design not only promises novel microwave applications for sensing and transferring information, but also lays down a general guideline for devising skyrmions operating over a broad range in the EM spectra.

ABSTRACT: Structured waves are ubiquitous for all areas of wave physics, both classical and quantum, where the wavefields are inhomogeneous and cannot be approximated by a single plane wave. Even the interference of two plane waves, or of a single inhomogeneous (evanescent) wave, provides a number of nontrivial phenomena and additional functionalities as compared to a single plane wave. Complex wavefields with inhomogeneities in the amplitude, phase, and polarization, including topological----- structures and singularities, underpin modern nanooptics and photonics, yet they are equally important, e.g. for quantum matter waves, acoustics, water waves, etc. Structured waves are crucial in optical and electron microscopy, wave propagation and scattering, imaging, communications, quantum optics, topological and non-Hermitian wave systems, quantum condensed-matter systems, optomechanics, plasmonics and metamaterials, optical and acoustic manipulation, and so forth. This Roadmap is written collectively by prominent researchers and aims to survey the role of structured waves in various areas of wave physics. Providing background, current research, and anticipating future developments, it will be of interest to a wide cross-disciplinary audience.

ABSTRACT: The peculiar properties of the gapless surface states with a Dirac cone shaped energy dispersion in topological insulators (TIs) enable promising applications in photodetection with an ultra-broad band and polarization sensitivity. Since many TIs can be easily grown on silicon (Si) substrates, TIs on Si could make an alternative route for photon detection of Si photonics. We present good device performances of a Si-based single-crystal bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3) photoconductive detector. Room temperature photo responses to 1064 nm and 1550 nm light illumination were demonstrated. Linear dependences of the photocurrent on both the incident light power and the bias voltage were observed. The main device parameters including responsivity and quantum efficiency were extracted.

ABSTRACT: In quantum optics, orbital angular momentum (OAM) is very promising to achieve high-dimensional quantum states due to the nature of infinite and discrete eigenvalues, which is quantized by the topological charge of l. Here, a heralded single-photon source with switchable OAM modes is proposed and demonstrated on silicon chip. At room temperature, the heralded single photons with 11 OAM modes (l = 2-6, -6 to -1) are successfully generated and switched through thermo-optical effect. It is believed that such an integrated quantum source with multiple OAM modes and operating at room temperature can provide a practical platform for high-dimensional quantum information processing. Moreover, this proposed architecture can also be extended to other material systems to further improve the performance of OAM quantum source.

ABSTRACT: "Bound states in the continuum (BICs) have attracted considerable research attention due to their infinite quality factor (Q-factor) and extremely localized fields, which drastically enhances light-matter interactions and yields high potential in topological photonics and quantum optics. In this study, the room temperature directional lasing normal to a BIC metasurface is demonstrated with hybrid surface lattice resonances. Compared to the plasmonic nanolasers, the BIC metasurface lasers possess directional radiation and a larger emission volume. The high Q-factor resonance of BIC metasurface overcomes the limitation of a large mode volume in achieving low-threshold lasing. In addition, a design rule is proposed to prevent the occurrence of wavelength shift when the Q-factor changes  thus, the lasing thresholds for different BIC metasurfaces can be compared. In this work, the high localization ability of BICs is used to achieve the low lasing threshold (1.25 nJ) at the room temperature. The light in-light out diagram of the aforementioned laser based on simulations and experiments exhibits a large spontaneous emission coupling factor (beta = 0.9) and the S-curve. The device developed in this study can be used in various applications, such as quantum emitters, optical sensing, nonlinear optics, and topological states engineering."

ABSTRACT: We propose an efficient analytical method to evaluate the robustness of integrated photonic devices and circuits in the presence of independently-distributed random variations in the device parameters. By approximating the output of a photonic system in terms of a first or second-order Taylor series, we derive closed-form expressions for the mean and variance of the system output, which allow us to compute the one-standard-deviation (1-sigma) bounds on the expected system performance. Compared to other approaches for evaluating robustness, our method does not require computationally-intensive numerical simulations of the system output and can apply to any statistical distribution of parameter variations, including uniform and normal distributions. We demonstrate the method by analyzing the robustness of two coupled resonator systems: a fifth-order microring filter, and optical delay lines based on 1D Coupled Resonator Optical Waveguides and 2D Floquet topological microring lattice. Our method could provide a useful tool in the design and analysis of robust optical devices and circuits.

ABSTRACT: Optical metamaterials present opportunities and challenges for manipulation of light. However, metamaterials with visible and near infrared responses are still particularly challenging to fabricate due to the complex preparation process and high loss. Here, a visible light poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM)-Ag metamaterial is prepared with the assistance of fifth-generation PAMAM (5G PAMAM), based on the dendritic structure. The large area of metamaterials, where Ag nanoparticles are spherical with diameters of similar to 9 nm and distributed in a multilevel netlike sphere, results in broadband resonance. The negative Goos-Hanchen shift and anomalous spin Hall effect of light generated by 5G PAMAM-Ag in visible broadband are observed, and a strong slab focusing effect at 750-1050 nm is demonstrated. In addition, the simulation shows possible application of the dendritic structure in topological photonics. The results offer advances in the preparation of large-scale visible light meta-materials, showing the potential for subwavelength super-resolution imaging and quantum optical information fields.

ABSTRACT: Topological semimetals such as Dirac, Weyl or nodal line semimetals are widely studied for their peculiar properties including high Fermi velocities, small effective masses and high magnetoresistance. When the Dirac cone is tilted, exotic phenomena could emerge whereas materials hosting such states are promising for photonics and plasmonics applications. Here we present evidence that SrAgBi is a spin-orbit coupling-induced type-II three-dimensional Dirac semimetal featuring tilted Dirac cone at the Fermi energy. Near charge compensation and Fermi surface characteristics are not much perturbed by 7% of vacancy defects on the Ag atomic site, suggesting that SrAgBi could be a material of interest for observation of robust optical and spintronic topological quantum phenomena.

ABSTRACT: Core concepts in singular optics, especially the polarization singularities, have rapidly penetrated the surging fields of topological and non-Hermitian photonics. For open photonic structures with non-Hermitian degeneracies in particular, polarization singularities would inevitably encounter another sweeping concept of Berry phase. Several investigations have discussed, in an inexplicit way, connections between both concepts, hinting at that nonzero topological charges for far-field polarizations on a loop are inextricably linked to its nontrivial Berry phase when degeneracies are enclosed. In this work, we reexamine the seminal photonic crystal slab that supports the fundamental two-level non-Hermitian degeneracies. Regardless of the invariance of nontrivial Berry phase (concerning near-field Bloch modes defined on the momentum torus) for different loops enclosing both degeneracies, we demonstrate that the associated far polarization fields (defined on the momentum sphere) exhibit topologically inequivalent patterns that are characterized by variant topological charges, including even the trivial scenario of zero charge. Moreover, the charge carried by the Fermi arc actually is not well defined, which could be different on opposite bands. It is further revealed that for both bands, the seemingly complex evolutions of polarizations are bounded by the global charge conservation, with extra points of circular polarizations playing indispensable roles. This indicates that although not directly associated with any local charges, the invariant Berry phase is directly linked to the globally conserved charge, physical principles underlying which have all been further clarified by a two-level Hamiltonian with an extra chirality term. Our work can potentially trigger extra explorations beyond photonics connecting Berry phase and singularities.

ABSTRACT: An integrated device capable of generating large number of multiplexed optical vortex beams with arbitrary topological charge is considered as one of the crucial requirement for driving information photonics forward. Here we report a simple method for simultaneous generation of 100 multiplexed optical vortex beams from a polymer film of size 1 mm(2) and thickness of 30 mu m. This is achieved through a combination of computer-generated holography, digital hologram printing and photoisomeric polymers. When the fabricated sample is illuminated with a collimated laser beam, a pre-determined vortex array with arbitrary topological charge is emitted. The polymer film easy to synthesize and exhibits a diffraction efficiency of 30% with a retention period longer than 50 days.

ABSTRACT: Scattering of electromagnetic waves by subwave-length objects is accompanied by the excitation of electric and magnetic Mie resonances that may modify substantially the scattering intensity and radiation pattern. Scattered fields can be decomposed into electric and magnetic multipoles, and the magnetic multipoles define magnetic response of structured materials underpinning the new field of all-dielectric resonant meta-optics. Here we review the recent developments in meta optics and nanophotonics and demonstrate that the Mie resonances can play a crucial role offering novel ways for the enhancement of many optical effects near magnetic and electric multipolar resonances, as well as driving a variety of interference phenomena which govern recently discovered novel effects in nanophotonics. We further discuss the frontiers of all-dielectric meta-optics for flexible and advanced control of light with full phase and amplitude engineering, including nonlinear nanophotonics, anapole nanolasers, quantum optics, and topological photonics.

ABSTRACT: Confocal microscopy is an essential imaging tool for biological systems, solid-state physics and nanophotonics. Using confocal microscopes allows performing resonant fluorescence experiments, where the emitted light has the same wavelength as the excitation laser. These challenging experiments are carried out under linear cross-polarization conditions, rejecting laser light from the detector. In this work, we uncover the physical mechanisms that are at the origin of the yet-unexplained high polarization rejection ratio which makes these measurements possible. We show in both experiment and theory that the use of a reflecting surface (i.e., the beam splitter and mirrors) placed between the polarizer and analyzer in combination with a confocal arrangement explains the giant cross-polarization extinction ratio of 108 and beyond. We map the modal transformation of the polarized optical Gaussian beam. We find an intensity hole in the reflected beam under cross-polarization conditions. We interpret this hole as a manifestation of the Imbert-Fedorov effect, which deviates the beam depending on its polarization helicity. This result implies that this topological effect is amplified here from the usually observed nanometer to the micrometer scale due to our cross-polarization dark-field methods. We confirm these experimental findings for a large variety of commercially available mirrors and polarization components, allowing their practical implementation in many experiments.

ABSTRACT: The nanoscale mode volumes of surface plasmon polaritons have enabled plasmonic lasers and condensates with ultra-fast operation(1-4). Most plasmonic lasers are based on noble metals, rendering the optical mode structure inert to external fields. Here we demonstrate active magnetic-field control over lasing in a periodic array of Co/Pt multilayer nanodots immersed in an IR-140 dye solution. We exploit the magnetic nature of the nanoparticles combined with mode tailoring to control the lasing action. Under circularly polarized excitation, angle-resolved photoluminescence measurements reveal a transition between the lasing action and non-lasing emission as the nanodot magnetization is reversed. Our results introduce magnetization as a means of externally controlling plasmonic nanolasers, complementary to modulation by excitation(5), gain medium(6,7) or substrate(8). Further, the results show how the effects of magnetization on light that are inherently weak can be observed in the lasing regime, inspiring studies of topological photonics(9-11).

ABSTRACT: Photonic bandgap engineering plays a key role in modern photonics since it allows for an ultimate control of photon propagation in periodic dielectric or metallic media. Tamm plasmon structures are a particularly attractive platform since the electromagnetic field can be completely controlled by patterning the thin metal layer. Up to now, only macroscopic patterning (larger than the operation wavelength) has been experimentally demonstrated, leading to 3D confinement of light but suffering from a lack of fine control of the dispersion properties of Tamm plasmons. Here, we report for the first time the opening of a bandgap in Tamm plasmon structures via subwavelength-periodic patterning of the metallic layer. By adopting a double period design, we experimentally put into evidence a photonic bandgap for the TE polarization up to 150 nm wide in the telecom wavelength range. Moreover, such a design offers a great flexibility to tailor on-demand, and independently, the bandgap size from 30 nm to 150 nm and its spectral position within a range of 50 nm. Finally, by implementing a defect cavity within the Tamm plasmon photonic crystal, a 1.6 mu m cavity supporting a single highly confined Tamm mode is experimentally demonstrated. All experimental results are in perfect agreement with numerical calculations. Our results demonstrate the possibility to engineer novel band dispersion with surface modes of hybrid metallic/dielectric structures, thus opening the way to applications in topological photonics, metamaterials, and parity-time symmetry physics.

ABSTRACT: In this work, to investigate the feasibility of plasmonics for data storage, we studied several aspects of the plasmoincs in confining and enhancing the light field in subwavelength metallic structures. Starting from the brief review on the plasmonic resonance in simple metallic nano-structures such as metallic ellipsoid and ellipsoidal metallic void, we extended our interest to the metallic apertures as a near-field transducer for data storage devices. Based on the several numerical calculations, simple and intuitive features in designing considerations such as resonance mechanisms, figure-of-merits, topological considerations in metallic apertures are discussed.

ABSTRACT: In the advancement of photonics technologies, all-optical systems are highly demanded in ultrafast photonics, signal processing, optical sensing and optical communication systems. All-optical devices are the core elements to realize the next generation of photonics integration system and optical interconnection. Thus, the exploration of new optoelectronics materials that exhibit different optical properties is a highlighted research direction. The emerging two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene, black phosphorus (BP), transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and MXene have proved great potential in the evolution of photonics technologies. The optical properties of 2D materials comprising the energy bandgap, third-order nonlinearity, nonlinear absorption and thermo-optics coefficient can be tailored for different optical applications. Over the past decade, the explorations of 2D materials in photonics applications have extended to all-optical modulators, all-optical switches, an all-optical wavelength converter, covering the visible, near-infrared and Terahertz wavelength range. Herein, we review different types of 2D materials, their fabrication processes and optical properties. In addition, we also summarize the recent advances of all-optical modulation based on 2D materials. Finally, we conclude on the perspectives on and challenges of the future development of the 2D material-based all-optical devices.

ABSTRACT: For decades, the light-matter interaction (LMI) based on Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation has dominated the fields of photonics, materials, and condensed-matter physics. However, in polar crystals, the BO approximation is not applicable when stimulated phonon polaritons are excited. Unlike the studies on topological physics and physical chemistry that go beyond BO approximation, here we unravel a stimulated phonon polariton-mediated LMI mechanism in polar crystals, which is radically different from the traditional LMI interpreted by BO approximation. In the regime of stimulated phonon polariton-mediated LMI, two exemplary experiments were conducted at different wavelengths: Q-factor increase of a LiNbO3 terahertz microcavity, and a five orders-of-magnitude enhancement of second-harmonic generation of infrared laser pulses in a LiNbO3 slab. Our study enhances the understanding of the LMI mechanism and shows potential for applications in the fields of optics/photonics and condensed-matter physics. Light-matter interaction has been dominated by Born-Oppenheimer approximation for centuries. Here the authors proposed a light-matter interaction mechanism beyond this approximation, proposing stimulated phonon polariton-mediated light-matter interaction, showing further understanding and applications in the fields of optics/photonics and condensed-matter physics.

ABSTRACT: Spin-momentum locking, a manifestation of topological properties that governs the behavior of surface states, was studied intensively in condensed-matter physics and optics, resulting in the discovery of topological insulators and related effects and their photonic counterparts. In addition to spin, optical waves may have complex structure of vector fields associated with orbital angular momentum or nonuniform intensity variations. Here, we derive a set of spin-momentum equations which describes the relationship between the spin and orbital properties of arbitrary complex electromagnetic guided modes. The predicted photonic spin dynamics is experimentally verified with four kinds of nondiffracting surface structured waves. In contrast to the one-dimensional uniform spin of a guided plane wave, a two-dimensional chiral spin swirl is observed for structured guided modes. The proposed framework opens up opportunities for designing the spin structure and topological properties of electromagnetic waves with practical importance in spin optics, topological photonics, metrology and quantum technologies and may be used to extend the spin-dynamics concepts to fluid, acoustic, and gravitational waves.

ABSTRACT: Orbital angular momentum (OAM) generation based on metasurfaces has attracted tremendous interest due to its potential in capacity enhancement of high-speed wireless communication systems. Reconfigurability is one of the key desired characteristics for the design of future metasurfaces. In this paper, a metasurface taking advantage of vanadium dioxide (VO2) is proposed. The proposed design can generate a non-diffractive OAM beam and achieve the multiple reconfigurability of the topological charge, beam radius, beam deflection angle. The operation frequency can be adjusted by controlling the state of VO2 at terahertz (THz) region. Simulation results demonstrate that the designed metasurface can generate a non-diffractive OAM beam with tunable topological charge and beam radius, propagating along +/- x or +/- y directions with the controllable deflection angle between 6.74 degrees and 44.77 degrees, ranging from 0.69 THz to 0.79 THz.

ABSTRACT: In this work, bending-induced deterioration of orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes in ring core fiber (RCF), photonic crystal fiber (PCF), and vortex fiber (VF) was theoretically investigated: Bending losses, coupling losses, and intermodal crosstalk at the interface between straight and bent optical fibers were investigated from the modal analysis of those three types of OAM mode fibers. In addition, the degradation of a topological charge number of an OAM mode due to the bending-induced birefringence and horizontal mode asymmetry was also investigated. Our investigation revealed that, in all aspects, the PCF is most robust to bending among the three types of optical fibers, and the most serious bending-induced problem in the VF and the RCF is the degradation of the topological charge number. The allowed minimum bending radii of VF and RCF appeared to be similar to 15 and similar to 45 mm, respectively, for the specific structures considered in this work. We expect that the methodology and results of our quantitative analysis on bending-induced degradation of OAM modes will be of great use in the design of OAM mode fibers for practical use.

ABSTRACT: Symmetry deepens our insight into a physical system and its interplay with topology enables the discovery of topological phases. Symmetry analysis is conventionally performed either in the physical space of interest, or in the corresponding reciprocal space. Here we borrow the concept of virtual space from transformation optics to demonstrate how a certain class of symmetries can be visualised in a transformed, spectrally related coordinate space, illuminating the underlying topological transitions. By projecting a plasmonic system in a higher-dimensional virtual space onto a lower-dimensional system in real space, we show how transformation optics allows us to construct a topologically non-trivial system by inspecting its modes in the virtual space. Interestingly, we find that the topological invariant can be controlled via the singularities in the conformal mapping, enabling the intuitive engineering of edge states. The confluence of transformation optics and topology here can be generalized to other wave realms beyond photonics. Visualizing and studying topological features is becoming crucial to develop new generation topological systems. Here the authors provide the theoretical and numerical demonstration of the potential of transformation optics connecting the virtual space to the physical space of lower dimension via conformal mapping.

ABSTRACT: The marriage of light (i.e., photon) and matter (i.e., exciton) in semiconductors leads to the formation of hybrid quasiparticles called exciton polaritons with fascinating quantum phenomena such as Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) and photon blockade. The research of exciton polaritons has been evolving into an era with emergent two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors and photonic structures for their tremendous potential to break the current limitations of quantum fundamental study and photonic applications. In this Perspective, the basic concepts of 2D excitons, optical resonators, and the strong coupling regime are introduced. The research progress of exciton polaritons is reviewed, and important discoveries (especially the recent ones of 2D exciton polaritons) are highlighted. Subsequently, the emergent 2D exciton polaritons are discussed in detail, ranging from the realization of the strong coupling regime in various photonic systems to the discoveries of attractive phenomena with interesting physics and extensive applications. Moreover, emerging 2D semiconductors, such as 2D perovskites (2DPK) and 2D antiferromagnetic (AFM) semiconductors, are surveyed for the manipulation of exciton polaritons with distinct control degrees of freedom (DOFs). Finally, the outlook on the 2D exciton polaritons and their nonlinear interactions is presented with our initial numerical simulations. This Perspective not only aims to provide an in-depth overview of the latest fundamental findings in 2D exciton polaritons but also attempts to serve as a valuable resource to prospect explorations of quantum optics and topological photonic applications.

ABSTRACT: Topological effects have endowed brand new properties to electronic and photonic systems, including the unidirectional propagating edge states and the associated intrinsic robustness. Recent progress in topological photonics has explored novel optical effects and motivated the related photonic devices. Here, a new mechanism for controlling the electromagnetic wave flow based on spatiotemporal metasurface assisted with parity-time (PT) symmetric modulations is proposed, and a proof-in-principle experiment is conducted in the microwave regime for verification. It is shown that the spatiotemporal metasurface can provide a powerful platform for realizing robust spin-momentum coupled surface states, in which the induced effects are similar to those discovered in the topological insulators and quantum spin-Hall systems. With the aid of programmable control unit, the generated spin-momentum coupling can be flexibly switched in real time. The proposed scheme is expected to construct a novel system for controlling the evanescent light flows and facilitate the investigation of physical effects that are hard to realize in the traditional photonic topological systems.

ABSTRACT: In this paper, by using the finite-difference time-domain method we study the formation of optical vortices by amplitude spiral zone plates with the topological charge of 2 mu m, the diameter of 8 mu m and the focal length of 0.532 mu m made in 0.1 mu m metal film. Silver and gold are proposed as a material of relief. The Gaussian beams at the wavelength of 0.532 mu m with left and right circularly polarization are considered as incident light. Analysis of amplitude, phase, and intensity for each electric field component shows the presence of phase singularities which produce vortex field with complex structure.

ABSTRACT: Compared with continuous wave lasers, ultrafast lasers have the advantages of ultra-short pulse width and ultra-high peak power, and have significant applications in optical communications, medical diagnostics, and precision machining. Saturable absorber (SA) technology is the most effective technique for the generation of ultra-fast lasers, which are based on artificial SAs and natural SAs. Among them, the semiconductor saturable absorber mirror has become the most commonly used form at present. Recently, basic research and application of nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene have been developed rapidly. Researchers have found that nanomaterials exhibit extraordinary characteristics in ultrafast photonics, such as the low saturation intensity of CNTs, zero-band gap of graphene, and extremely high modulation depth of the topological insulator nano-films. Since graphene was first reported as an SA in 2009, many other nanomaterials have been successively explored, resulting in the rapid development of novel nanomaterial-based SAs. In this paper, we classified the nanomaterials used in SA mode-locking technology at 1.5 mu m and reviewed their research progress with a particular focus on nonlinear optical properties, integration strategies, and applications in the field of ultrafast photonics.

ABSTRACT: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) are a special type of waves that coexist with continuous waves without any radiation loss. Owing to eliminated dissipative coupling to the environment, the coupling between BICs is naturally considered to be dispersive. Here, dissipative coupling between BICs in coupled photonic waveguides is exploited on an etchless lithium niobate integrated platform, and for the first time, supermode BICs are experimentally observed on a chip. It is discovered that, under the variation of the waveguide gap, the two supermodes have complementarily varied loss rates and the supermode BIC appears periodically, which verifies respectively the dissipative nature of coupling and periodic variation of the coupling coefficient between the two coupled photonic waveguides. The observed dissipatively coupled BICs can enable many on-chip applications such as high-sensitivity sensing, optical communication, and topological physics.

ABSTRACT: Micro- and nanolasers are emerging optoelectronic components with many properties still to be explored and understood. On the one hand, they make it possible to address fundamental physical questions in the border area between classical physics and quantum physics, on the other hand, they open up new application perspectives in many areas of photonics. This progress report provides an overview of the exciting developments from conventional semiconductor lasers toward nanoscale lasers, whose function relies on increased light-matter interaction in low-mode-volume resonators and unconventional gain concepts. The latest advances in the physical understanding of light emission from high-beta lasers, in which a large part of the spontaneous emission is coupled into the laser mode, are highlighted. In the limit of beta = 1, this leads to thresholdless lasing and it is shown that quantum optical characterization is required to fully explore the underlying emission processes. In addition, emerging nanolaser concepts based on Fano resonators, topological photonics, and 2D materials are presented. Open questions, future prospects, and application scenarios of high-beta lasers in integrated photonics, quantum nanophotonics, and neuromorphic computing are discussed.

ABSTRACT: The non-Hermitian nature of confined photonic modes is described by the electric complex modal volume, VE, which represents a key parameter that leads to counterintuitive effects, such as negative modal contribution to the local density of states and non-Lorentzian lineshapes. Here, we address the magnetic counterpart of VE by means of near-field perturbation experiments in a photonic crystal slab cavity. We study the relevant role played by the imaginary part of the magnetic modal volume, VH, which can increase the quality factor of the confined modes by means of a local external magnetic perturbation. We show how a mapping of the spatial distribution of both the real and imaginary parts of VH can be inferred by near-field experiments employing Al-covered near-field tips. Our findings deepen the role of the magnetic component of light and could open a new route in employing metamaterials, magnetic quantum emitters, and topological photonics.

ABSTRACT: The effect of twisting phases on the polarization dynamics of a vector vortex beam with a spatially variant state of polarization (SoP) is investigated theoretically and experimentally. The twisted vector vortex optical field with the cross-phase modulation is experimentally generated and observed. The presence of the twisting phases on the vector optical field results in novel propagation dynamics and the evolution of polarization states. The optical field performs the process of compressing and stretching the orthogonal polarization components and the linear-circular polarization conversions during propagation. Different from the scalar twisted beams, the orthogonal polarization components of twisted vector beams can be compressed along the same azimuthal angle or the orthogonal azimuthal angles, depending on the signs of the twist intensity coefficients. For an anisotropic twisted optical field, the SoP and the optical field rotate, and the rotation behaviors are sensitively dependent on the twisting coefficients. Furthermore, the two vortex topological charges embedded within the orthogonal polarization component of a twisted vector vortex beam can be simultaneously identified by looking at the interference fringes of the twisting phases. This work reveals that a vector vortex beam and its SoP can be dynamically manipulated by twisting phases.

ABSTRACT: Valley-contrast physics has gained considerable attention, particularly for realizing photonic topological insulators (PTIs) that support reflection-free valley-polarized edge modes (VPEMs) in the absence of inter-valley scattering. It is an open question whether similar robust states can exist in the absence of topological valley phase, i.e., nonvanishing Berry curvature at the valleys. It is shown that a C-6 upsilon-symmetric triangular photonic crystal (PhC) inherently exhibits uniform distribution of spatially varying phase vortices, which support a local (limited) version of valley Hall effect (LVHE), where the valley polarization is location defined as opposed to being fixed throughout the bulk. Then it is demonstrated that defect regions with sublattice asymmetry in otherwise a symmetric PhC lead to wave localization and splitting of photons according to their valley index, thus enabling VPEMs along a line defect waveguide. The device is fabricated on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) slab, and it is characterized at near-infrared frequencies showing robust transmission through sharp bends comparable to valley PTIs. The results present a new perspective to creating valley edge states and outline a new waveguiding mechanism applicable to electromagnetics as well as plasmonics, mechanics, and acoustics.

ABSTRACT: We have investigated the nonlinear and ultrafast photonics of chemically processed black phosphorus quantum dots (BPQDs) synthesized by the solvothermal treatment approach, with an average lateral size of about 2.48 +/- 0.4 nm. BPQDs exhibit optical saturable absorption measured by the balanced twin-detector measurement system at the telecommunication band and have been demonstrated for the generation of passively mode-locking operation in an erbium-doped fiber laser. Either two-pulse or three-pulse bound state of soliton pulse has been obtained, making the best use of the BPQDs-based saturable absorber. Our work suggests that BPQDs might be developed as an efficient optical saturable absorber for ultrafast photonics applications.

ABSTRACT: Self-healing and transverse accelerating optical vortices are generated via modulating Gaussian beams through subsequent liquid crystal q-plate and polarization Airy mask. We analyze the propagation dynamics of these vortex Airy beams, and find that they possess the features of both optical vortices and Airy beams. Topological charges and characteristics of nondiffraction, self-healing, and transverse acceleration are experimentally verified. In addition, vortex Airy beams with both topological charge and radial index are demonstrated and mode switch among Gaussian, vortex, vector, Airy beams and their combinations can be acquired easily. Our design provides a flexible and highly efficient way to generate unique optical vortices with self-healing and transverse acceleration properties, and facilitates prospective applications in optics and photonics.

ABSTRACT: The short range order structure of Bi13Ge20Se67-xTex glasses (x = 0,5,10,15,20 at.%) is explored by using high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Results show that the incorporated oxygen from surface containment of specimens and Te substitution for Se exert important impacts on the network structure of glasses. Oxygen breaks the Ge-Ge homopolar bonds in the. Ge-Se-Bi glass, leading to a significant reduction of the over-constrained Ge-Ge (Se)(3) ethane-like units. Te addtion promotes the formation of mixed BiSe(Te)(3/2) nanolayers as crystal precursors, thus initiating crystallinzation in competition to a topological self-organization process. The present work will be helpful to deepen the understanding of ChG glasses for applications in fields of optoelectronics and photonics. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Unconventional Weyl points (WPs), carrying topological charge 2 or higher, possess interesting properties different from ordinary charge-1 WPs, including multiple Fermi arcs that stretch over a large portion of the Brillouin zone. Thus far, such WPs have been observed in chiral materials and acoustic metamaterials, but there has been no clean demonstration in photonics in which the unconventional photonic WPs are separated from trivial bands. We experimentally realize an ideal symmetry-protected photonic charge-2 WP in a three-dimensional topological chiral microwave metamaterial. We use field mapping to directly observe the projected bulk dispersion, as well as the two long surface arcs that form a noncontractible loop wrapping around the surface Brillouin zone. The surface states span a record-wide frequency window of around 22.7% relative bandwidth. We demonstrate that the surface states exhibit a novel topological self-collimation property and are robust against disorder. This work provides an ideal photonic platform for exploring fundamental physics and applications of unconventional WPs.

ABSTRACT: A topological optimization design for the lightweight technology of supporting plate of the primary mirror is presented in this paper. The supporting plate of the primary mirror is topologically optimized under the condition of determined shape, loads and environment. And the optimal structure is obtained. The diameter of the primary mirror in this paper is 450mm, and the material is SiC1. It is better to select SiC/Al as the supporting material. Six points of axial relative displacement can be used as constraints in optimization(2). Establishing the supporting plate model and setting up the model parameters. After analyzing the force of the main mirror on the supporting plate, the model is applied with force and constraints. Modal analysis and static analysis of supporting plates are calculated. The continuum structure topological optimization mathematical model is created with the variable-density method. The maximum deformation of the surface of supporting plate under the gravity of the mirror and the first model frequency are assigned to response variable, and the entire volume of supporting structure is converted to object function. The structures before and after optimization are analyzed using the finite element method. Results show that the optimized fundamental frequency increases 29.85Hz and has a less displacement compared with the traditional structure.

ABSTRACT: We design sub-wavelength passive non-reciprocal optical devices using recently discovered magnetic Weyl semimetals. These passive bulk topological materials do not require any external magnetic field and exhibit anomalous Hall effect which results in giant magnetooptical effects. The designed isolators have dimensions that are reduced by three orders of magnitude compared to conventional magneto-optical configurations. Our results indicate that the magnetic Weyl semimetals may open up new avenues in photonics for the design of various nonreciprocal components.

ABSTRACT: Weyl medium has triggered remarkable interest owing to its nontrivial topological edge states in 3D photonic band structures that were mainly revealed as surface modes yet. It is undoubted that the connection of two different Weyl media will give rise to more fruitful physics at their interface, while they face extreme difficulty in high-dimensional lattice matching. Here, we successfully demonstrate the non-Hermitian Weyl interface physics in complex synthetic parameter space, which is implemented in a loss-controlled silicon waveguide array. By establishing non-Hermitian Hamiltonian in the parameter space, new Weyl interfaces with distinct topological origins are predicted and experimentally observed in silicon waveguides. Significantly, our Letter exploits the non-Hermitian parameter to create the synthetic dimension by manipulating the non-Hermitian order, which successfully circumvents the difficulty in lattice matching for high-dimensional interfaces. The revealed rich topological Weyl interface states and their phase transitions in silicon waveguide platform further imply potentials in chip-scale photonics integrations.

ABSTRACT: The peculiar nonlinear optical responses of two-dimensional (2D) materials endow them highly attractive for photonics applications. This review systematically discusses the performance of pulsed lasers employing 2D materials as their modulation device. First, it is crucial to categorize 2D materials that can act as saturable absorbers, encompassing a range of substances such as Graphene, Black Phosphorus, Topological Insulators, MXene, and even heterojunction. Furthermore, a thorough investigation is conducted to analyze the performance indexes to study the nonlinear characteristics of 2D materials in the pulse generation. Especially, the focus is on the 1.5 mu m band ultrafast lasers utilizing 2D materials. This paper also provides a comprehensive analysis of the obstacles and prospects in 2D materials preparation, and their utilization in the pulse laser systems.

ABSTRACT: Here we study three different types of astigmatic laser beams (ALB), whose complex amplitude in the Fresnel diffraction zone is described by the complex argument Hermite polynomial of the order (n, 0). The first type is a circularly symmetric optical vortex with a topological charge n after passing through a cylindrical lens. On propagation, the optical vortex splits into n first-order optical vortices. Its orbital angular momentum (OAM) per photon is equal to n. The second type is the ALB of order (n, 0), which is generated when an elliptical laser beam passes through a cylindrical lens. The third type is an elliptical optical vortex with a topological charge n after passing through a cylindrical lens. With a special choice of the ellipticity degree (1:3), such a beam retains its structure upon propagation and the degenerate intensity null on the optical axis does not split into n optical vortices. Such a beam has fractional OAM not equal to n.

ABSTRACT: Gyroid structures are of extensive interest because they provide a rich platform for chiroptics as well as topological photonics. While the double-gyroid morphology as a bicontinuous structure is not uncommon in self-assembled soft materials, direct self-assembly of single-network gyroids has proven elusive. Here, an enantiomorphic pair of single-gyroid crystals comprising colloidal spheres is presented, and two distinct routes are demonstrated for programmed self-assembly of each single colloidal gyroid enantiomorph from rationally designed patchy spheres. The designer colloidal patchy spheres, which closely hew to their synthetic feasibility, are chiral, having either two staggered rectangular patches at opposite poles or four circular patches arranged in a well-defined geometry. The single colloidal gyroid, as well as its inverse structure, is shown to support a wide complete photonic bandgap in addition to exhibiting rich chiroptical properties, making them attractive chiral photonic crystals. The versatility of this single colloidal gyroid, the bottom-up routes devised here in silico, and the robustness of the design space for the chiral colloidal patchy spheres together make a strong case for single colloidal gyroids to supersede colloidal diamond, as a target for programmed self-assembly, in the quest for a photonic crystals operating at optical frequencies.

ABSTRACT: Topological characteristics of energy bands, such as Dirac and Weyl nodes, have attracted substantial interest in condensed matter systems as well as in classical wave systems. Among these energy bands, the type-II Dirac point is a nodal degeneracy with tilted conical dispersion, leading to a peculiar crossing dispersion in the constant-energy plane. Such nodal points have recently been found in electronic materials. The analogous topological feature in photonic systems remains a theoretical curiosity, with experimental realization expected to be challenging. Here, we experimentally realize the type-II Dirac point using a planar metasurface architecture, where the band degeneracy point is protected by the underlying mirror symmetry of the metasurface. Gapless edge modes are found and measured at the boundary between the different domains of the symmetry-broken metasurface. Our Letter shows that metasurfaces are simple and practical platforms for realizing electromagnetic type-II Dirac points, and their planar structure is a distinct advantage that facilitates applications in two-dimensional topological photonics.

ABSTRACT: The vortex, a fundamental topological excitation featuring the in--plane winding of a vector field, is important in various areas such as fluid dynamics, liquid crystals, and superconductors. Although commonly existing in nature, vortices were observed exclusively in real space. Here, we experimentally observed momentum-space vortices as the winding of far-field polarization vectors in the first Brillouin zone of periodic plasmonic structures. Using homemade polarization-resolved momentum-space imaging spectroscopy, we mapped out the dispersion, lifetime, and polarization of all radiative states at the visible wavelengths. The momentum-space vortices were experimentally identified by their winding patterns in the polarization-resolved isofrequency contours and their diverging radiative quality factors. Such polarization vortices can exist robustly on any periodic systems of vectorial fields, while they are not captured by the existing topological band theory developed for scalar fields. Our work provides a new way for designing high-Q plasmonic resonances, generating vector beams, and studying topological photonics in the momentum space.

ABSTRACT: Since the discovery of optical vortex (OV) until its application, they have been extensively exploited in the field of optics and photonics. In the last decade, this research has intensified in optical communications, where OV can be implemented as a new multiplexing technique that allows high transmission rates and scalability in systems due to their compatibility with current modulation and multiplexing techniques. In this work, we design phase masks for implement in an Orbital Angular Momentum Multiplexing / Demultiplexing system. We used a superposition of phase mask of a Laguerre-Gaussian beam with linear carriers to allow redirection of the beam to reduce the complexity of the demultiplexing system.

ABSTRACT: Dual-band equipment has unique advantages as regards ensuring the stability of wireless commu-nication and improving efficiency. With the development of topological photonics and phononics, electromagnetic and mechanical wave transmission with simultaneous advantages, e.g., antireflection, broadband, and nondispersion characteristics, has been simultaneously realized. This outcome has greatly improved elastic wave manipulation performance in solids, which are important media for wireless com-munication. Here, using a plate phononic crystal (PnC), a dual-mode elastic topological insulator is theoretically designed and experimentally realized, and the quantum spin Hall effect is observed under a dual band. Using discrete Kekule modulation to construct the PnC multidomain junction, dual-mode and dual-band Dirac vortexes, i.e., a type of topological corner state, are obtained in a single PnC. These trans-mitted and localized topological states have the same excellent properties as their antecedents, which are obtained with single-band materials. The implementation mechanisms are diverse and applicable to multi-ple modes and broad frequencies, offering antijamming, low-loss, high-efficiency, and high-capacity signal processing components. The findings of this study will aid development of solid-state topology PnCs, as well as future topological-phononic integrated circuits with high performance and multifunctionality.

ABSTRACT: Periodic arrays can support highly nontrivial modal dispersion, stemming from the interplay between localized resonances of the array elements and distributed resonances supported by the lattice. Recently, intentional defects in the periodicity, i.e., broken in situ symmetries, have been attracting significant attention as a powerful degree of freedom for dispersion control. Here we explore highly nontrivial dispersion features in the resonant response of linear arrays of plasmonic particles, including the emergence of braiding and band knots caused by band folding. We show that these phenomena can be achieved within simple dipolar arrays for which we can derive closed-form expressions for the dispersion relation. These phenomena showcase powerful opportunities stemming from broken symmetries for extreme dispersion engineering, with a wide range of applications, from plasma physics to topological wave phenomena. Our theoretical model can also be generalized to higher dimensions to explore higher-order symmetries, e.g., glide symmetry and quasi-periodicity.

ABSTRACT: Novel layered bismuth oxysulfide (Bi2O2S) has shown great potential in photoelectric detection, photocatalysis, and photochemical cells due to its excellent properties such as excellent environmental stability, high carrier mobility, and favorite band gap (about 1-1.5 eV). These excellent physical properties also make it advantageous for applications in the field of ultrafast photonics. However, to date, there has been no reported research on Bi2O2S in ultrafast fiber lasers. In this work, we report a facile method to synthesize Bi2O2S nanosheets by a combination of the hydrothermal and liquid-phase exfoliation (LPE) methods with good crystallinity and thickness less than 10 nm. Further, stable mode-locked pulses are achieved by applying the Bi2O2S SA in Erdoped and Tm-doped fiber lasers, respectively. The Er-doped mode-locked fiber laser has a pulse width of 453.6 fs and the optical spectrum is stable, with a maximum output power of 5.1 mW in the mode-locked state. The obtained Tm-doped mode-locked fiber laser based on Bi2O2S has an estimated pulse width of 2.69 ps and a maximum output power of 7.13 mW. Our results provide new opportunities for the development of Bi2O2S together with its application in ultrafast photonics.

ABSTRACT: "Disorder is an essential parameter in photonic systems and devices, influencing phenomena such as the robustness of topological photonic states and the Anderson localization of modes in waveguides. We develop and demonstrate a method for both analyzing and visualizing positional, size, and shape disorder in periodic structures such as photonic crystals. This analysis method shows selectivity for disorder type and sensitivity to disorder down to less than 1%. We show that the method can be applied to more complex shapes such as those used in topological photonics. The method provides a powerful tool for process development and quality control, including analyzing the precision of E-beam lithography before patterns are transferred  quantifying the precision limits of lithography, deposition, or etch processes  and studying the intentional displacement of individual objects within otherwise periodic arrays."

ABSTRACT: The exploration of topological boundary effects is one of the important aspects that could foster the development of future topological photonics devices. Here the authors propose a straightforward method to construct sharp boundaries in synthetic dimensions using a modulated ring resonator strongly coupled to an auxiliary ring. Synthetic dimensions have garnered widespread interest for implementing high dimensional classical and quantum dynamics on low-dimensional geometries. Synthetic frequency dimensions, in particular, have been used to experimentally realize a plethora of bulk physics effects. However, in synthetic frequency dimension there has not been a demonstration of a boundary which is of paramount importance in topological physics due to the bulk-edge correspondence. Here we construct boundaries in the frequency dimension of dynamically modulated ring resonators by strongly coupling an auxiliary ring. We explore various effects associated with such boundaries, including confinement of the spectrum of light, discretization of the band structure, and the interaction of boundaries with one-way chiral modes in a quantum Hall ladder, which exhibits topologically robust spectral transport. Our demonstration of sharp boundaries fundamentally expands the capability of exploring topological physics, and has applications in classical and quantum information processing in synthetic frequency dimensions.

ABSTRACT: A photonic wheel describes a special structure in which the electric vector spins (with time) in a plane containing the propagation direction, while around a C-point (a point with circular polarization) the polarization Mobius strip can be formed topologically in three-dimensional (3D) space. These two interesting but very different structures are both unique to 3D structured fields, and in this article they are studied together and also their connections are analyzed. By highly confining the trigonometric beams, the three-dimensional (3D) fields with a wide area of photonic wheels are constructed, and the characteristics of the photonic wheels in different regions are analyzed. The expression for the C-lines of the photonic wheels is derived, which provides a simple way to get the exact position of the C-lines and also is a basis for observing polarization Mobius strips. Along a C-line, the behaviors of the polarization Mobius strips, including two typical (generic) Mobius strips with opposite indices, and two special topological events seemingly violating the topological law are examined. Our results show that the trick and the paradox in the two special events actually are the manifestations of the trace-dependent property and the observer-dependent property of the polarization Mobius strips respectively. The finding also suggests that even in a short segment of a C-line rich topological events related to polarization Mobius strips can be observed. Our research provides a way to observe the photonic wheels, the polarization Mobius strips and their connection, also supplies a theoretical foundation for special structures in 3D fields.

ABSTRACT: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) in a periodic structure sandwiched between two homogeneous media have interesting properties and useful applications in photonics. The topological nature of BICs was previously revealed based on a topological charge related to the far-field polarization vector of the surrounding resonant states. Recently, it was established that when symmetry-protected BICs (with a nonzero topological charge) are destroyed by generic symmetry-breaking perturbations, pairs of circularly polarized resonant states (CPSs) emerge and the net topological charge is conserved. A periodic structure can also support propagating BICs with a nonzero wave vector. These BICs are not protected by symmetry in the sense of symmetry mismatch, but they need symmetry for their robust existence. Based on a highly accurate computational method for a periodic array of slightly noncircular cylinders, we show that a propagating BIC is typically destroyed by a structural perturbation that breaks only the in-plane inversion symmetry, and when this happens, a pair of CPSs of opposite handedness emerge so that the net topological charge is conserved. We also study the generation and annihilation of CPSs when a structural parameter is varied. It is shown that two CPSs with opposite topological charge and the same handedness, connected to two BICs or in a continuous branch from one BIC, may collapse and become a CPS with a zero charge. Our study clarifies the important connection between symmetry and topological charge conservation.

ABSTRACT: The condensed matter Haldane and Kane-Mole models revolutionized the understanding of what is an insulator, as they unveiled novel classes of media that behave as metals near the surface, but are insulating in the bulk. Here, we propose exact electromagnetic analogues of these two influential models relying on a photonic crystal implementation of artificial graphene subject to an effective magnetic field. For the Haldane model, the required effective magnetic field for photons can be emulated with a spatially variable pseudo-Tellegen response. For the Kane-Mele model, the spin-orbit coupling can be mimicked using matched anisotropic dielectrics with identical permittivity and permeability, without requiring any form of bianisotropic couplings. Using full-wave numerical simulations and duality theory we verify that the nontrivial topology of the two proposed platforms results in the emergence of topologically protected gapless edge states at the interface with a trivial photonic insulator. Our theory paves the way for the emulation of the two condensed matter models in a photonic platform and determines another paradigm to observe topologically protected edge states in a fully reciprocal all-dielectric and non-uniform anisotropic metamaterial.

ABSTRACT: Exceptional points, where eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce, impact the behavior of different photonics components that show, e.g., enhanced sensing, coherent perfect absorption, unidirectional lasing, and chirality. However, only a few passive geometries have been developed that work on these points. Here, we introduce a novel non-Hermitian structure based on a microresonator shaped as the infinity symbol twice coupled to a bus waveguide: the infinity-loop microresonator. Unlike other structures working on an exceptional surface, the infinity-loop microresonator can achieve either high- or low-contrast unidirectional reflection with a negligible or identical reflection for counterpropagating light. It allows an easy walking through the Riemann sheet by simply controlling the phase of the light propagating in the bus waveguide, which makes it a tunable component to build more complex topological structures. Furthermore, the infinity-loop microresonator allows sensors that show the features of both an exceptional point device and a diabolic point device simultaneously.

ABSTRACT: Optical isolation enables nonreciprocal manipulations of light with broad applications in optical communications. Optical isolation by rotating structures has drawn considerable attention due to its magnetic-free nature and unprecedented performance. Conventional rotation-based optical isolation relies on the use of bulky cavities hindering applications in subwavelength photonics. Here, we propose a mechanism of optical isolation by integrating the unique dispersion of a hyperbolic metamaterial with the transverse spin-orbit interaction of evanescent waves. We show that rotation of a subwavelength hyperbolic nanoparticle breaks the time-reversal symmetry and yields two resonant chiral modes that selectively couple to the transverse spin of waveguide modes. Remarkably, the transverse spin-orbit interaction can give rise to unidirectional coupling and more than 95% isolation of infrared light at an experimentally feasible rotation speed. Our work fuses the two important fields of optical isolation and photonic spin-orbit interactions, leading to magnetic-free yet compact nonreciprocal devices for applications in optical communications, chiral quantum optics, and topological photonics.

ABSTRACT: Flexible control of building blocks of photonic crystals enables achieving desirable band structures. Exploration of photonic band extrema has brought many fantastic features to design artificial optical materials, such as Brillouin-zone-corner extrema for valley photonic materials and zone-center extremum for zero-index metamaterials. However, two such kinds of extrema are always found independently in different photonic crystals. In this work, a kind of valley photonic crystals possessing both zone-center and zone-corner band extrema almost at the same frequency is proposed. Inspired by antennas theory, a three-antenna array (TAA) source is devoted to individually manipulate each extremum. The correlation coefficient is given to determine the coupling efficiency between the TAA source and extrema eigenmodes. By using a source with a high correlation coefficient, these extrema bulk states are selectively excited consistent with their eigenfields. Furthermore, three control cases are shown that multiple extrema points are simultaneously excited, in order to confirm the validity of the correlation coefficient. Finally, a potential application of a beam-steering device is proposed through selective excitation of ternary extrema. This work develops binary valley states into ternary mix states, rendering more degrees of freedom for on-chip optical information transport, particularly for beam steering and mode division multiplexing.

ABSTRACT: Because of the wealth of fascinating physical phenomena observed in topological insulators (TIs), their exciting properties have been intensively investigated for electronic and optoelectronic applications, such as quantum devices, saturable absorbers, and photodetectors, in the visible to terahertz (THz) spectral range. However, their potential for metaphotonic devices has yet to be explored. Here, we present a comprehensive investigation on the active photonic performance of a novel metaphotonic device by hybridizing ultrathin Bi2Se3 bridges into metamaterials in the THz range. Unlike THz modulation via Fano-like plasmon-phonon destructive interference in the pure Bi2Se3 structure, our Bi2Se3 microribbon arrays with high photo-conductivity can short-circuit the circulating surface currents in the proposed metasurfaces, leading to remarkable electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) transmission and group delay modulations at the operational frequency. Additionally, the width of the Bi2Se3 bridges is optimized to 20 mu m to maximize the modulation depth, with the modulation of the transmission resonance amplitude and the group delay as high as 31% and 2.7 ps, respectively. Due to the short photocarrier lifetime in Bi2Se3 films (within a few picoseconds), the full recovery time after photoinjection is less than 9.5 ps, enabling an ultrafast switching speed up to a hundred GHz. The ultrafast and effective control of the light spectrum in Bi2Se3-functionalized metaphotonic systems lays the foundation for promoting the emergence of TI-based optoelectronics.

ABSTRACT: The concept of non-Hermitian physics, originally developed in the context of quantum field theory, has been investigated on distinct photonic platforms and created a plethora of counterintuitive phenomena. Interfacing non-Hermitian photonics and nanoplasmonics, here, we demonstrate unidirectional excitation and reflection of surface plasmon polaritons by elaborately designing the permittivity profile of non-Hermitian metagratings, in which the eigenstates of the system can coalesce at an exceptional point. Continuous tuning of the excitation or reflection ratios is also possible through altering the geometry of the metagrating. The controllable direction-ality and robust performance are attributed to the phase transition near the exceptional point, which is fully confirmed by the theoretic calculation, numerical simulation, and experimental characterization. Our work pushes non-Hermitian photonics to the nanoscale regime and paves the way toward high-performance plas-monic devices with superior controllability, performance, and robustness by using the topological effect asso-ciated with non-Hermitian systems.

ABSTRACT: Most optical metamaterials fabricated and studied to date employ metallic components resulting in significant losses, heat and overall low efficiencies. A new era of metamaterial physics is associated with all-dielectric meta-optics, which employs electric and magnetic Mie resonances of subwavelength particles with high refractive index for an optically induced magnetic response, thus underpinning a new approach to design and fabricate functional and practical metadevices. Here we review the recent developments in meta-optics and subwavelength dielectric photonics and demonstrate that the Mie resonances can play a crucial role in the realization of the unique functionalities of meta-atoms, also driving novel effects in the fields of metamaterials and nanophotonics. We discuss the recent research frontiers in all-dielectric meta-optics and uncover how Mie resonances can be employed for a flexible control of light with full phase and amplitude engineering, including unidirectional metadevices, highly transparent metasurfaces, non-linear nanophotonics and topological photonics.

ABSTRACT: Optical trapping is a state-of-the-art methodology that plays an integral role in manipulating and investigating microscopic objects but faces formidable challenges in multiparticle trapping, flexible manipulation, and high-integration applications. In this study, we propose and demonstrate a switchable optical scheme for trapping microparticles incorporating disparate vortex-pair beams generated by a polarization-multiplexed metasurface. The miniaturized all-dielectric metasurface, which comprises an array of titanium dioxide nanoposts, was manufactured and characterized to provide polarization-tuned two-fold vortex-pair beams. The profiles of the created vortices can be flexibly tailored by adjusting the combination of topological charges and the separation among phase singularities. Under transverse electric polarized light conditions, a vortex-pair beam with opposite topological charge combinations traps a single microparticle within one beam spot, while under transverse magnetic polarization conditions, two microparticles are captured simultaneously by a vortex-pair beam with the same topological charge signs. The proposed switchable trapping scheme (incorporating a vortex-pair light beam) is expected to feature enhanced integration and flexible manipulation of multiple particles with potential applications in biophysics, nanotechnology, and photonics.

ABSTRACT: Weyl points (WPs), as the doubly degenerate points in three-dimensional momentum band structures, carry quantized topological charges and give rise to a variety of extraordinary properties, such as robust surface wave and chiral anomaly. Type-II Weyl semimetals, which have conical dispersions in Fermi surfaces and a strongly tilted dispersion with respect to type I, have recently been proposed in condensed-matter systems and photonics. Although the type-II WPs have been theoretically predicted in acoustics, the experimental realization in phononic crystals has not been reported so far. Here, we experimentally realize a type-II Weyl phononic crystal. We demonstrate the topological transitions observed at the WP frequencies and the topological surface acoustic waves between the Weyl frequencies. The experiment results are in good accordance with our theoretical analyses. Due to the violation of the Lorentz symmetry, the type-II WPs only exist in low energy systems. As the analog counterpart in classical waves, the phononic crystal brings a platform for the research of type-II WPs in macroscopic systems.

ABSTRACT: "Vortices arise in many natural phenomena as dark points of total destructive interference. Sometimes they form continuous lines and even enclosed loops with knotted or linked topologies in three spatial dimensions. Since the mathematical topology was introduced into physics, from hydrodynamics, condensed matter physics to photonics, and other modern physical fields, scientists have been exploring the related topological essences of vortex knots  hence, the topology is a forefront topic in different physical systems. Owing to the reliability and observability of light in free space, optical vortex knots and links are the most studied physical topologies. Here, we review some of these developments with a focus on optical vortex knots and links. We first introduce the brief historical perspective and structural properties of optical vortices. Then, we trace the progress on the theoretically constructing, experimentally generating, and characterizing methods of topological light fields. Wherein, we review recent developments of holographic metasurfaces and their applications in generating ultrasmall optical vortex knots. At last, we envision the possible challenges and prospects of topological light fields."

ABSTRACT: Non-Hermitian systems, with symmetric or antisymmetric Hamil- tonians under the parity-time (PT) operations, can have entirely real or imaginary eigenvalues. This fact has led to surprising discoveries such as loss-induced lasing and topological energy transfer. A merit of anti-PT systems is free of gain, but in recent efforts on making anti-PT devices, nonlinearity is still required. Here, counterintuitively, we show how to achieve anti-PT symmetry and its spontaneous breaking in a linear device by spinning a lossy resonator. Compared with a Hermitian spinning device, significantly enhanced optical isolation and ultrasensitive nanoparticle sensing are achievable in the anti-PT-broken phase. In a broader view, our work provides a new tool to study anti-PT physics, with such a wide range of applications as anti-PT lasers, anti-PT gyroscopes, and anti-PT topological photonics or optomechanics.

ABSTRACT: With the discovery of PT-symmetric quantum mechanics, it was shown that even non-Hermitian systems may exhibit entirely real eigenvalue spectra. This finding did not only change the perception of quantum mechanics itself, it also significantly influenced the field of photonics. By appropriately designing one-dimensional distributions of gain and loss, it was possible to experimentally verify some of the hallmark features of PT-symmetry using electromagnetic waves. Nevertheless, an experimental platform to study the impact of PT-symmetry in two spatial dimensions has so far remained elusive. We break new grounds by devising a two-dimensional PT-symmetric system based on photonic waveguide lattices with judiciously designed refractive index landscape and alternating loss. With this system at hand, we demonstrate a non-Hermitian two-dimensional topological phase transition that is closely linked to the emergence of topological mid-gap edge states.

ABSTRACT: Weyl points are the simplest topologically protected degeneracy in a three-dimensional dispersion relation. The realization of Weyl semimetals in photonic crystals has allowed these singularities and their consequences to be explored with electromagnetic waves. However, it is difficult to achieve nonlinearities in such systems. One promising approach is to use the strong coupling of photons and excitons, because the resulting polaritons interact through their exciton component. Yet topological polaritons have only been realized in two dimensions. Here, we predict that the dispersion relation for polaritons in three dimensions, in a bulk semiconductor with an applied magnetic field, contains Weyl points and Weyl line nodes. We show that absorption converts these Weyl points to Weyl exceptional rings. We conclude that bulk semiconductors are a promising system in which to investigate topological photonics in three dimensions, and the effects of dissipation, gain, and nonlinearity.

ABSTRACT: Because of their ability to confine light, optical resonators(1-3) are of great importance to science and technology, but their performance is often limited by out-of-plane-scattering losses caused by inevitable fabrication imperfections(4,5). Here we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate a class of guided resonances in photonic crystal slabs, in which out-of-plane-scattering losses are strongly suppressed by their topological nature. These resonances arise when multiple bound states in the continuum-each carrying a topological charge(6)-merge in momentum space and enhance the quality factors Q of all nearby resonances in the same band. Using such resonances in the telecommunication regime, we experimentally achieve quality factors as high as 4.9 x 10(5)-12 times higher than those obtained with standard designs-and this enhancement remains robust for all of our samples. Our work paves the way for future explorations of topological photonics in systems with open boundary conditions and for their application to the improvement of optoelectronic devices in photonic integrated circuits.

ABSTRACT: Quantum simulation is to use a controllable quantum system to simulate other complicated or hard-tocontrol quantum system, and to deal with some complex unknown quantum systems that cannot be simulated on classical computers due to the exponential explosion of the Hilbert space. Among different kinds of physical realizations of quantum simulation, integrated optical systems have emerged as an appropriate platform in recent years due to the advantages of flexible control, weak decoherence, and no interaction in optical systems. In this review, we attempt to introduce some of the basic models used for quantum simulation in integrated photonic systems. This review article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the commonly used material platforms for integrated quantum simulation, including the silicon-based, lithium niobate-based integrated circuits, and the femtosecond laser direct writing optical waveguides. Several integrated optical platforms such as the coupled waveguide arrays, photonic crystals, coupled resonator arrays, and multiport interferometers are also introduced. In Section 3, we focus on the analog quantum simulations in the integrated photonic platform, including Anderson localization of light in disordered systems, various kinds of topological insulators, nonlinear and non-Hermitian systems. More specifically, in Subsection 3.1, we present the integrated photonic realizations of disordered and quasi-periodic systems. In Subsection 3.2, we review the integrated photonic realizations of the topological insulators with and without time-reversal symmetry, including Floquet topological insulators, quantum spin hall system, anomalous quantum hall system, valley hall system, SuSchrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, and photonic topological Anderson insulators. Besides, topological insulator lasers and topologically protected quantum photon sources are briefly reviewed. In Subsection 3.3, we review the nonlinear and non-Hermitian integrated optical systems. In Section 4 we present the integrated digital quantum simulations based on the multiport interferometers, including the discrete-time quantum random walk, Boson sampling, and molecular simulation. In Section 5, we summarize the content of the article and present the outlook on the future perspectives of the integrated photonic quantum simulation. We believe that the integrated photonic platforms will continue to provide an excellent platform for quantum simulation. More practical applications will be found based on this system through combining the fields of topological photonics, laser technologies, quantum information, nonlinear and non-Hermitian physics.

ABSTRACT: Integrated photonics is attracting considerable attention and has found many applications in both classical and quantum optics, fulfilling the requirements for the ever-growing complexity in modern optical experiments and big data communication. Femtosecond (fs) laser direct writing (FLDW) is an acknowledged technique for producing waveguides (WGs) in transparent glass that have been used to construct complex integrated photonic devices. FLDWpossesses unique features, such as three-dimensional fabrication geometry, rapid prototyping, and single step fabrication, which are important for integrated communication devices and quantum photonic and astrophotonic technologies. To fully take advantage of FLDW, considerable efforts have been made to produce WGs over a large depth with low propagation loss, coupling loss, bend loss, and highly symmetrical mode field. We summarize the improved techniques as well as the mechanisms for writing high-performance WGs with controllable morphology of cross-section, highly symmetrical mode field, low loss, and high processing uniformity and efficiency, and discuss the recent progress of WGs in photonic integrated devices for communication, topological physics, quantum information processing, and astrophotonics. Prospective challenges and future research directions in this field are also pointed out.

ABSTRACT: Current experimental realizations of the quantum anomalous Hall phase in both electronic and photonic systems have been limited to a Chern number of one. In photonics, this corresponds to a single-mode one-way edge waveguide. Here, we predict quantum anomalous Hall phases in photonic crystals with large Chern numbers of 2, 3, and 4. These new topological phases were found by simultaneously gapping multiple Dirac and quadratic points. We demonstrate a continuously tunable power splitter as a possible application of multimode one-way waveguides. All our findings are readily realizable at microwave frequencies.

ABSTRACT: We show that a product of two Laguerre-Gaussian (pLG) beams can be expressed as a finite superposition of conventional LG beams with particular coefficients. Based on such an approach, an explicit relationship is derived for the complex amplitude of pLG beams in the Fresnel diffraction zone. Two identical LG beams of the duet produce a particular case of a squared Fourier-invariant LG beam, termed as an (LG)(2) beam. For a particular case of pLG beams described by Laguerre polynomials with azimuthal numbers n - m and n + m, an explicit expression for the complex amplitude in a Fourier plane is derived. Similar to conventional LG beams, the pLG beams can be utilized for information transmission, as they are characterized by orthogonal azimuthal numbers and carry an orbital angular momentum equal to their topological charge.

ABSTRACT: Negative refraction, an unnatural optical phenomenon in which the incident and the refracted waves reside on the same side of the surface normal, has been demonstrated with the invention of negative index media based on artificially engineered photonic structures called metamaterials. It has received wide attention due to its potential applications in imaging, nonlinear optics, and electromagnetic cloaking. However, it is highly challenging to realize negative refraction operating at all angles and with the perfect transmission. In this work, leveraging the recent development in topological photonics, we propose to realize reflectionless negative refraction for all incident angles with a topological metamaterial. The proposed metamaterial possesses two Weyl points of opposite topological charges. By interfacing the metamaterial with a perfect electric conductor (PEC) or a perfect magnetic conductor (PMC), the Fermi arc connecting the two Weyl points can take the form of a half-circle possessing a positive or a negative refractive index. Importantly, due to the topological protection, there is no reflection at the interface between the PEC and PMC covered areas, leading to the observation of all-angle negative refraction without reflection at the boundary. Our work provides a new platform for manipulating the propagation of surface waves, which may find applications in the construction of integrated photonic devices.

ABSTRACT: Propagation of the Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) light beams with fractional topological charges in a moving defocusing nonlinear medium is studied. The fractional charge LG beam is constructed as a weighted superposition of the standard LG modes with integer charges. Our model is governed by a nonlocal nonlinear Schrodinger equation and describes in particular the beam propagation in the atmosphere along the earth surface with allowance for thermal nonlinearity and in the presence of a cross-wind. The numerical simulations have revealed the remarkable stability of the cross-section intensity distribution in the fractional charge LG beams during their propagation, as compared with the case of integer charge beams.

ABSTRACT: The inevitable noise and decoherence in the quantum circuit hinder its scalable development, so quantum error correction and quantumness protection for multiple controllable qubits system are necessary. The flatband in the dispersion relation, based on its inherent locality and high degenerate energy band structure, shows non-diffractive transport properties in the line spectrum and has the potential possibility to protect quantum resources in special lattices. The pioneer work has proved that the topologically boundary state is robust to protect the quantumness from disorder and perturbation, which inspires that quantumness can be protected anywhere in a periodic structure, including the boundary state and bulk state. Here, we showthe topological protection of quantum resources with different state combinations in a sawtooth lattice. Photons can be localized at any degenerate eigenmode, and the localized effect is determined by only one parameter, without additional modulations. We show a high violation of Cauchy-Schwarz inequality up to 35 standard deviations by measuring cross correlation and auto-correlation of correlated photons. We verify that the topological protection is robust to different wavelengths of correlated photons. Our results suggest an alternative way of exploring topological protection in flatband and bulk state, demonstrating the powerful ability of topological photonics to protect quantum resources.

ABSTRACT: "Compared with homogeneous two-dimensional materials, two-dimensional nanomaterial heterostructures which consist of different kinds of two-dimensional materials exhibit stronger light-matter interaction. The topological insulator of Bi2Se3-Bi2Te3 heterostructures were synthesised by two-step reaction proceeding. The reaction arised in two steps: at first, Bi2Se3 nanosheets were prepared in the solvent of ethylene glycol (EG)  secondly, Bi2Te3 was epitaxial grown on the Bi2Se3 nanosheets to form heterostructure materials. The spatial self-phase modulation (SSPM) effect of 457nm, 532nm and 671nm was achieved by dispersing the as-prepared Bi2Se3-Bi2Te3 heterostructure materials into ethanol as an optical medium. Furthermore, based on the effect of SSPM, a device called all-optical switching was also realized. As an interesting nonlinear optical materials, topological insulator Bi2Se3-Bi2Te3 heterostructures might be an effective proposal for photonics devices such as optical switchings, optical modulators, photodetectors, etc. (C) 2019 Author(s)."

ABSTRACT: We report on the experimental demonstration of two-photon quantum walks at the edge of a photonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattice and compare them to those observed when launching photons at the edge of a homogeneous lattice. Whereas at the topological edge, one of the photons primarily remains close to the edge, both photons penetrate freely from the trivial edge into the bulk. This behavior manifests also in the average inter-particle distance, which is significantly larger at the topological edge. Hence, for a given propagation length, the entangled two-photon state launched at the topological edge extends over a wider domain of the lattice. (C) 2020 Chinese Laser Press

ABSTRACT: Photonic time-crystals (PTCs) are spatially homogeneous media whose electromagnetic susceptibility varies periodically in time, causing temporal reflections and refractions for any wave propagating within the medium. The time-reflected and time-refracted waves interfere, giving rise to Floquet modes with momentum bands separated by momentum gaps (rather than energy bands and energy gaps, as in photonic crystals). Here, we present a study on the emission of radiation by free electrons in PTCs. We show that a free electron moving in a PTC spontaneously emits radiation, and when associated with momentum-gap modes, the electron emission process is exponentially amplified by the modulation of the refractive index. Moreover, under strong electron-photon coupling, the quantum formulation reveals that the spontaneous emission into the PTC bandgap experiences destructive quantum interference with the emission of the electron into the PTC band modes, leading to suppression of the interdependent emission. Free-electron physics in PTCs offers a platform for studying a plethora of exciting phenomena, such as radiating dipoles moving at relativistic speeds and highly efficient quantum interactions with free electrons.

ABSTRACT: We present a novel type of accelerating beam generated by a discrete Airy-Vortex phase mask based on the digital holographic technology. The study shows that the main lobe and the side lobes of such beam rotate with different angular momentums and the whole beam evolves into two separated Airy-like beams in the far field. The intensity distribution of the main lobe and the side lobes in the near field can be modulated by tuning the topological gradient AL, and AL independently. The propagation path of the main lobe follows a parabolic trajectory. The experimental results are consistent with the numerical simulations.

ABSTRACT: Precise control over photonic states can be achieved in pre-engineered materials, like photonic crystals and meta-structures. However, high fabrication precisions are required due to the sensitivity of such states to different perturbation channels. Hence photonic states that immune to disorder in the system is in high demand. In this work, we propose a hybrid platform that integrates tunable transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) and a standard silicon-on-insulator wave-guide technology, to achieve ultrafast all-optical control of the topology of photonic states. Particularly, we demonstrate that ultrafast control of coupling between ring resonators with integrated TCO modulators enables a synthetic gauge magnetic field and therefore provides ultrafast control of topology protection. The approach can be used for the realization of topological phase transitions, an essential component of several emerging photonic applications, including topologically protected optical modulators and switches.

ABSTRACT: Wireless power transfer (WPT) has triggered immense research interest in a range of practical applications, including mobile phones, logistic robots, medical-implanted devices and electric vehicles. With the development of WPT devices, efficient long-range and robust WPT is highly desirable but also challenging. In addition, it is also very important to actively control the transmission direction of long-range WPT. Recently, the rise of topological photonics provides a powerful tool for near-field robust control of WPT. Considering the technical requirements of robustness, long-range and directionality, in this work we design and fabricate a one-dimensional quasiperiodic Harper chain and realize the robust directional WPT using asymmetric topological edge states. Specially, by further introducing a power source into the system, we selectively light up two Chinese characters, which are composed of LED lamps at both ends of the chain, to intuitively show the long-range directional WPT. Moreover, by adding variable capacitance diodes into the topological quasiperiodic chain, we present an experimental demonstration of the actively controlled directional WPT based on electrically controllable coil resonators. With the increase in voltage, we measure the transmission at two ends of the chain and observe the change of transmission direction. The realization of an actively tuned topological edge states in the topological quasiperiodic chain will open up a new avenue in the dynamical control of robust long-range WPT.

ABSTRACT: Topological matter and topological optics have been studied in many systems, with promising applications in materials science and photonics technology. These advances motivate the study of the interaction between topological matter and light, as well as topological protection in light-matter interactions. In this work, we study a waveguide-interfaced topological atom array. The light-matter interaction is nontrivially modified by topology, yielding optical phenomena. We find topology-enhanced photon absorption from the waveguide for a large Purcell factor, i.e., F/ F0 > 1, where F and F0 are the atomic decays to the waveguide and environment, respectively. To understand this unconventional photon absorption, we propose a multichannel scattering approach and study the interaction spectra for edge- and bulk-state channels. We find that, by breaking inversion and time-reversal symmetries, optical anisotropy is enabled for the reflection process, but the transmission is isotropic. Through a perturbation analysis of the edge-state channel, we show that the anisotropy in the reflection process originates from the waveguide-mediated non-Hermitian interaction. However, the inversion symmetry in the non-Hermitian interaction makes the transmission isotropic. At a topology-protected atomic spacing, the subradiant edge state exhibits huge anisotropy. Because of the interplay between edge- and bulk-state channels, a large topological bandgap enhances nonreciprocal reflection of photons in the waveguide for weakly broken time-reversal symmetry, i.e., F0/ F << 1, producing complete photon absorption. We show that our proposal can be implemented in superconducting quantum circuits. The topology-enhanced photon absorption is useful for quantum detection. This work shows the potential to manipulate light with topological quantum matter.

ABSTRACT: "Geometrical dimensionality plays a fundamentally important role in the topological effects arising in discrete lattices. Although direct experiments are limited by three spatial dimensions, the research topic of synthetic dimensions implemented by the frequency degree of freedom in photonics is rapidly advancing. The manipulation of light in these artificial lattices is typically realized through electro-optic modulation  yet, their operating bandwidth imposes practical constraints on the range of interactions between different frequency components. Here we propose and experimentally realize all-optical synthetic dimensions involving specially tailored simultaneous short- and long-range interactions between discrete spectral lines mediated by frequency conversion in a nonlinear waveguide. We realize triangular chiral-tube lattices in three-dimensional space and explore their four-dimensional generalization. We implement a synthetic gauge field with nonzero magnetic flux and observe the associated multidimensional dynamics of frequency combs, all within one physical spatial port. We anticipate that our method will provide a new means for the fundamental study of high-dimensional physics and act as an important step towards using topological effects in optical devices operating in the time and frequency domains. Photonics: Lighting up synthetic dimensionsStudies and applications in physics requiring consideration of more than three dimensions will be assisted by a method for creating all-optical synthetic dimensions, allowing deeper exploration of topological effects. The frequencies of interacting light, e.g., can act as the lattice sites in multiple synthetic dimensions in addition to the three dimensions of space. A research team led by Andrey Sukhorukov at The Australian National University developed a theoretical framework for multidimensional lattices wrapped in a tube using light travelling in a single nonlinear waveguide. With collaborators from University of Sydney led by Benjamin Eggleton, they experimentally demonstrated the synthetic dimensions in a nonlinear fibre by implementing light interactions with precisely tailored optical pumps. In addition to assisting research in fundamental physics, the method could have practical applications in quantum communication and information processing."

ABSTRACT: Here, we formally develop theoretical methods to topologically classify awide class of bianisotropic continuous media. It is shown that for continuous media, the underlying wave vector space may be regarded as the Riemann sphere. We derive sufficient conditions that ensure that the pseudo-Hamiltonian that describes the electrodynamics of the continuous material is well behaved so that the Chern numbers are integers. Our theory brings the powerful ideas of topological photonics to a wide range of electromagnetic waveguides and platforms with no intrinsic periodicity and sheds light over the emergence of edge states at the interfaces between topologically inequivalent continuous media.

ABSTRACT: "We investigate a photonic device consisting of two coupled optical cavities possessing Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling, TE-TM splitting, and linear polarization splitting that opens a tunable energy gap at the diabolic points of the photon dispersion  giving rise to an actively addressable local Berry curvature. The proposed architecture stems from recent advancements in the design of artificial photonic gauge fields in liquid crystal cavities [K. Rechcinska et al., Science 366, 727 (2019)]. Our study opens perspectives for topological photonics, room-temperature spinoptronics, and studies on the quantum geometrical structure of photonic bands in extreme settings."

ABSTRACT: Fourier-plane microscopy is a powerful tool for measuring the angular optical response of a plethora of materials and photonic devices. Among them, optical microcavities feature distinctive energy-momentum dispersions, crucial for a broad range of fundamental studies and applications. However, measuring the whole momentum space (k-space) with sufficient spectral resolution using standard spectroscopic techniques is challenging, requiring long and alignment-sensitive scans. Here, we introduce a k-space hyperspectral microscope, which uses a common-path birefringent interferometer to image photoluminescent organic microcavities, obtaining an angle-and wavelength-resolved view of the samples in only one measurement. The exceptional combination of angular and spectral resolution of our technique allows us to reconstruct a three-dimensional (3D) map of the cavity dispersion in the energy-momentum space, revealing the polarization-dependent behavior of the resonant cavity modes. Furthermore, we apply our technique for the characterization of a dielectric nanodisk metasurface, evidencing the angular and spectral behavior of its anapole mode. This approach is able to provide a complete optical characterization for materials and devices with nontrivial angle-/wavelength-dependent properties, fundamental for future developments in the fields of topological photonics and optical metamaterials.

ABSTRACT: Topological edge states arise at the interface of two topologically distinct structures and have two distinct features: they are localized and robust against symmetry protecting disorder. On the other hand, conventional transport in one dimension is associated with extended states, which typically do not have topological robustness. In this letter, using lossy coupled resonators in one dimension, we demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally the existence of robust states residing in the bulk. We show that they are unusually robust against disorders in coupling between adjacent sites and losses. Our work paves the way to a different form of robust transport that is not limited to boundary phenomena and can be accessed more easily from the far field.

ABSTRACT: Understanding the effects of disorder on the light propagation in photonic devices is of major importance from both fundamental and applied points of view. Unidirectional reflectionless and coherent perfect absorption of optical signals are unusual yet fascinating phenomena that have recently sparked an extensive research effort in photonics. These two phenomena, which arise from topological deformations of the scattering matrix S parameters space, behave differently in the presence of different types of disorder, as we show here for a lossy photonic crystal prototype with a parity-time antisymmetric susceptibility or a more general non-Hermitian one.

ABSTRACT: Symmetry and topology govern many electronic, magnetic, and photonic phenomena in condensed matter physics and optics, resulting in counterintuitive skyrmion, meron, and other phenomena important for modern technologies. Here we demonstrate photonic spin lattices as a new topological construct governed by the spin-orbit coupling in an optical field. The symmetry of the electromagnetic field in the presence of the spin-orbit interaction may result in only two types of photonic spin lattices: either hexagonal spin-skyrmion or square spin-meron lattices. We show that these spin structures correspond to the lowest energy of the electromagnetic field configuration, therefore, energetically stable. We further show that in the absence of spin-orbit coupling these spin topologies are degenerated in dynamic field skyrmions, unifying the description of electromagnetic field topologies. The results provide a new understanding of electromagnetic field topology and its transformations as well as new opportunities for applications in quantum technologies, spin optics, and topological photonics.

ABSTRACT: The Clifford spectrum is a form of joint spectrum for noncommuting matrices. This theory has been applied in photonics, condensed matter and string theory. In applications, the Clifford spectrum can be efficiently approximated using numerical methods, but this only is possible in low dimensional example. Here we examine the higher-dimensional spheres that can arise from theoretical examples. We also describe a constructive method to generate five real symmetric almost commuting matrices that have a K-theoretical obstruction to being close to commuting matrices. For this, we look to matrix models of topological electric circuits. (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: We developed planar multilayered photonic-plasmonic structures, which support topologically protected optical states on the interface between metal and dielectric materials, known as optical Tamm states. Coupling of incident light to the Tamm states can result in perfect absorption within one of several narrow frequency bands, which is accompanied by a singular behavior of the phase of electromagnetic field. In the case of near-perfect absorptance, very fast local variation of the phase can still be engineered. In this work, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate how these drastic phase changes can improve sensitivity of optical sensors. A planar Tamm absorber was fabricated and used to demonstrate remote near-singular-phase temperature sensing with an over an order of magnitude improvement in sensor sensitivity and over 2 orders of magnitude improvement in the figure of merit over the standard approach of measuring shifts of resonant features in the reflectance spectra of the same absorber. Our experimentally demonstrated phase-to-amplitude detection sensitivity improvement nearly doubles that of state-of-the-art nanopatterned plasmonic singular-phase detectors, with further improvements possible via more precise fabrication. Tamm perfect absorbers form the basis for robust planar sensing platforms with tunable spectral characteristics, which do not rely on low-throughput nanopatterning techniques.

ABSTRACT: Topological defects in nematic liquid crystals (NLCs) are an interesting material system to study both from a theoretical point of view and for applications in photonics, soft-robotics and colloidal assembly. By using a photo-aligned template at one or both confining substrates, different disclination interconnections in the bulk can be readily stabilized. We imposed a periodic defect grid of 1/2 and -1/2 defects at the surface with the help of photoalignment and combined this with a uniform homeotropic counter substrate. This alignment configuration was used to study the optical properties and the relative stability of different types of disclinations in detail. The arrays of disclination lines are investigated by polarizing optical microscopy for different orientations of the polarizers and for different applied voltages. A theoretical analysis is performed to understand the relative frequency of occurrence for distinct types of disclinations and numerical simulations are used to verify the difference in optical appearance. The unequal elastic constants for splay, twist and bend strongly influence both properties and make it possible to identify different types of disclination lines form their optical appearance.

ABSTRACT: Controlling light propagation using artificial photonic crystals and electromagnetic metamaterials is an important topic in the vibrant field of photonics. Notably, chiral edge states on the surface or at the interface of photonic Chern insulators can be used to make reflection-free waveguides. Here, by both theoretical analysis and electromagnetic simulations, we demonstrate that gyromagnetic hyperbolic metamaterials (GHM) are photonic Chern insulators with superior properties. As a novel mechanism, the simultaneous occurrence of the hyperbolic and gyromagnetic effects in these metamaterials is shown to open the large topological band gaps with a gap Chern number of one. Importantly, the GHM Chern insulators possess nonradiative chiral edge modes on their surfaces, and thus allow us to fabricate unidirectional waveguides without cladding metals which generally incur considerable Ohmic loss. Furthermore, the photonic edge states in the proposed Chern insulators are robust against disorder on a wide range of length scales, in strong contrast to crystalline topological insulators, and the light flow direction on the surface of the Chern insulators can be easily flipped by switching the direction of an applied magnetic field. Fascinatingly, we find that negative refraction of the topological surface wave occurs at the boundary between the GHMs with the opposite signs of gyromagnetic parameters. Finally, we show that compared with other photonic topological materials such as chiral hyperbolic materials, the present GHM Chern insulators can be much easier to fabricate.

ABSTRACT: We study mode coupling of an edge state with bulk states in a coupled waveguide chain in the presence of gain and losses. In a low non-Hermiticity regime, it is found that the edge state associated with the interface between two topologically different waveguide chains is well isolated from the bulk states, sharing the exact same features as the well-known Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Model. As the non-Hermiticity increases, the two bands of the overall waveguide chain merge together, which leads to the overlap in the band diagram between the edge state and states of lower bands. We find that before the PT-symmetry breaking, the edge state is strongly coupled to bulk states of lower bands, evident by the anti-crossing feature in the band diagram. The strong mode hybridization is verified by a non-Hermitian coupled mode theory developed from reaction conservation, and is further examined using phenomenological models. We envisage that the strong coupling between the edge state and the bulk state may be useful in expanding our understanding in topological photonics in non-Hermitian condition, as well as in applications such as mode conversion between edge and bulk states.

ABSTRACT: Structured optical fields inside a waveguide possess the transverse spin, i.e., the spin angular momentum perpendicular to the direction of the waveguide. The physical origin of the transverse spin can be attributed to the presence of an effective rest mass of photons in guided waves, or equivalently, to the existence of a longitudinal field component, such that the transverse and longitudinal fields together form an elliptical polarization plane. In contrary to the traditional viewpoint, the transverse spin of photons in guided waves is also quantized, and its quantization form is related to the ellipticity of the polarization ellipse. The direction of the transverse spin depends on the propagation direction of electromagnetic waves along the waveguide, such a spin-momentum locking may have important applications in spin-dependent unidirectional optical interfaces. By means of a coupling between the transverse spin of guided waves and some physical degrees of freedom, one can develop an optical analogy of spintronics, i.e., spinoptics.

ABSTRACT: "We discuss bulk and edge states of bound photon pairs supported by the one-dimensional array of nonlinear optical cavities for the two scenarios: (i) dimer array consisting of identical cavities with the two types of tunneling constants and with on-site Kerr-type nonlinearity  (ii) simple array of identical cavities with both on-site nonlinearity and nearest neighbor nonlinear interaction. It is demonstrated that both structures can support interaction-induced edge states of bound photon pairs. We analyze the properties of such exotic states thus providing the insights into the emerging field of nonlinear topological photonics."

ABSTRACT: The concept of synthetic dimensions has generated interest in many branches of science, ranging from ultracold atomic physics to photonics, as it provides a versatile platform for realizing effective gauge potentials and topological physics. Previous experiments have augmented the real-space dimensionality by one additional physical synthetic dimension. In this study, we endow a single ring resonator with two independent physical synthetic dimensions. Our system consists of a temporally modulated ring resonator with spatial coupling between the clockwise and counterclockwise modes, creating a synthetic Hall ladder along the frequency and pseudospin degrees of freedom for photons propagating in the ring. We observe a wide variety of physics, including effective spin-orbit coupling, magnetic fields, spin-momentum locking, a Meissner-to-vortex phase transition, and signatures of topological chiral one-way edge currents, completely in synthetic dimensions. Our experiments demonstrate that higher-dimensional physics can be studied in simple systems by leveraging the concept of multiple simultaneous synthetic dimensions.

ABSTRACT: Topological valley photonics provides a unique way to manipulate the flow of light. In general, valley edge states that exhibit unidirectional propagation and are immune to defects and disorders could be realized at the interface between two valley photonic crystals with opposite valley Chern numbers. Herein, by merging the physics of valley edge states and bound states in the continuum, we propose and numerically demonstrate a novel, to the best of our knowledge, concept of edge states termed bound valley edge states in the continuum, which enjoys the topological features of valley edge states, such as, unidirectional propagation and immunity to disorders, but are formed at the interface between air and a single valley photonic crystal. Our results not only provide an effective way to reduce the size of valley photonic structures but also facilitate new applications where the proposed concept of bound valley edge states in the continuum could be exploited for optical sensing and unidirectional waveguiding.

ABSTRACT: The continued convergence of electronics and photonics on the chip scale can benefit from the voltage control of optical polarization for applications in communications, signal processing and sensing. It is challenging, however, to electrically manipulate the polarization state of light in planar optical waveguides. Here we introduce out-of-plane optical waveguides, allowing access to Berry's phase, a quantum-mechanical phenomenon of purely topological origin. As a result, electrically tunable optical polarization rotation on the chip scale is achieved. Devices fabricated in the silicon-on-insulator material platform are not limited to a single static polarization state. Rather, they can exhibit dynamic tuning of polarization from the fundamental transverse electric mode to the fundamental transverse magnetic mode. Electrical tuning of optical polarization over a 19 dB range of polarization extinction ratio is demonstrated with less than 1 dB of conversion loss at infrared wavelengths. Compact system architectures involving dynamic control of optical polarization in integrated circuits are envisioned.

ABSTRACT: "Complex Ginzburg-Landau (CGL) models of laser media (with cubic-quintic nonlinearity) do not contain an effective diffusion term, which makes all vortex solitons unstable in these models. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the addition of a two-dimensional periodic potential, which may be induced by a transverse grating in the laser cavity, to the CGL equation stabilizes compound (four-peak) vortices, but the most fundamental crater-shaped vortices (CSVs), alias vortex rings, which are essentially squeezed into a single cell of the potential, have not been found before in a stable form. In this work we report on families of stable compact CSVs with vorticity S = 1 in the CGL model with the external potential of two different types: an axisymmetric parabolic trap and the periodic potential. In both cases, we identify a stability region for the CSVs and for the fundamental solitons (S = 0). Those CSVs which are unstable in the axisymmetric potential break up into robust dipoles. All the vortices with S = 2 are unstable, splitting into tripoles. Stability regions for the dipoles and tripoles are identified, too. The periodic potential cannot stabilize CSVs with S >= 2 either  instead, families of stable compact square-shaped quadrupoles are found."

ABSTRACT: Recently, there has been a lot of activity in the research field of topological non-Hermitian physics, partly driven by fundamental interests and partly driven by applications in photonics. However, despite these activities, a general classification and characterization of non-Hermitian Dirac models that describe the experimental systems is missing. Here, we present a systematic investigation of massive Dirac models on periodic lattices, perturbed by general non-Hermitian terms. We find that there are three different types of non-Hermitian terms. For each case we determine the bulk exceptional points, the boundary modes, and the band topology. Our findings serve as guiding principles for the design of applications, for example, in photonic lattices. For instance, periodic Dirac systems with non-Hermitian mass terms can be used as topological lasers. Periodic Dirac systems with non-Hermitian anticommuting terms, on the other hand, exhibit exceptional points at the surface, whose nontrivial topology could be utilized for optical devices.

ABSTRACT: Floquet topological insulators have inspired analogues in photonics, optics, and acoustics, in which nonreciprocal wave propagation in time-modulated materials is achieved due to the breaking of time-reversal symmetry. We investigate a mechanical wave analogue of Thouless pumping and the quantum Hall effect (QHE) in one- (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) periodically time-modulated materials, respectively. In one dimension, wave propagation in the time-modulated system is characterized based on the adiabatic theorem, and topologically protected one-way edge modes are numerically demonstrated by the principle of bulk-edge correspondence. In two dimensions, a time-modulation scheme of a hexagonal lattice is suggested and polarized edge states characteristics of QHE are put into evidence by the plane wave expansion (PWE) method. The transition from the trivial state to the topological one is captured and interpreted by an invariant Chern number. We numerically demonstrate the existence of topologically protected one-way edge states immune to scattering by sharp corners, defects, randomly disordered modulation phases, and dissipation effects.

ABSTRACT: In this paper, an analysis of the fields formed by the high-aperture binary conventional and spiral zone plates is presented. The study was performed by using the FullWAVE software package which implements the finite difference time domain method. The conventional zone plate was illuminated by optical vortices with topological charge m = 1, 2, and 3 while proposed spiral zone plates with the same topological charges m = 1, 2, and 3 were illuminated by an ordinary Gaussian beam. It was shown that proposed binary zone plates made of silica glass form a different intensity and energy flow distribution in their focal planes. The spiral zone plate in the focal plane produces the intensity distribution with m discontinuity while the conventional zone plate produces a ring-shaped intensity pattern with two maxima on the vertical axis. During the propagation of vortex field formed by spiral zone plate, the intensity pattern changes and become a ring.

ABSTRACT: We have shown how the spin Hall effect is formed in a tight focus for two light fields with initial linear polarization. We have demonstrated that an even number of local subwavelength regions appear in which the sign of the longitudinal projection of the spin angular momentum (the third Stokes component) alternates. When an optical vortex with topological charge n and linear polarization passes through an ideal spherical lens, additional optical vortices with topological charges n + 2, n - 2, n + 1, and n - 1 with different amplitudes are formed in the converged beam. The first two of these vortices have left and right circular polarizations and the last two vortices have linear polarization. Since circularly polarized vortices have different amplitudes, their superposition will have elliptical polarization. The sign of this elliptical polarization (left or right) will change over the beam cross section with the change in the sign of the difference in the amplitudes of optical vortices with circular polarization. We also have shown that optical vortices with topological charges n + 2, n - 2 propagate in the opposite direction near the focal plane, and together with optical vortices with charges n + 1, n - 1, they form an azimuthal energy flow at the focus.

ABSTRACT: "Recently discovered higher-order states extensively enrich the study of topological phases, allowing one to manipulate wave propagating or localizing in more than one dimension lower than the bulk. To date, vast higher-order topological phases have been demonstrated in photonics, acoustics, mechanics, and electronics  however, these are usually in magnetic-free scenarios. Here, we report our realization of magnetic corner states in a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice gyromagnetic photonic crystal. By simultaneously breaking both time-reversal and parity symmetries with one-sublattice magnetic bias, we elaborately gap the native gapless chiral edge states of the quantum-Hall phase. In the complete band gaps, we experimentally observe a pair of unconventional corner states originating from the hybridization of two Wannier centers to shape symmetrical and antisymmetrical modes. Furthermore, we can switch on (off) the corner field localizations solely by adding (removing) the magnetic fields of the corner sites without changing other configurations."

ABSTRACT: Quantum walks represent paradigmatic quantum evolutions, enabling powerful applications in the context of topological physics and quantum computation. They have been implemented in diverse photonic architectures, but the realization of two-particle dynamics on a multidimensional lattice has hitherto been limited to continuous-time evolutions. To fully exploit the computational capabilities of quantum interference it is crucial to develop platforms handling multiple photons that propagate across multidimensional lattices. Here, we report a discrete-time quantum walk of two correlated photons in a two-dimensional lattice, synthetically engineered by manipulating a set of optical modes carrying quantized amounts of transverse momentum. Mode-couplings are introduced via the polarization-controlled diffractive action of thin geometric-phase optical elements. The entire platform is compact, efficient, scalable, and represents a versatile tool to simulate quantum evolutions on complex lattices. We expect that it will have a strong impact on diverse fields such as quantum state engineering, topological quantum photonics, and Boson Sampling.

ABSTRACT: Future large aperture telescopes and high contrast imaging systems will often include segment gaps, structural obscurations, along with outer edges which produce diffraction effects that are disadvantageous to high contrast imaging (e.g., for exoplanet detection) or continuous wavefront control across the optical aperture. We present an optimization strategy for several pupil segment topologies for next-generation telescope concepts. Wave propagation results based on diffraction-limited point spread function analyses using Fraunhofer diffraction theory are presented using the Python-based POPPY simulation tool.

ABSTRACT: The topological transition of an iso-frequency contour will provide a powerful control for the interaction between light and matter. For example the transition of iso-frequency contour from an elliptical dispersion to a hyperbolic dispersion can result in many interesting optical phenomena including super-resolution, optical switching and collimation. In recently published literature, it has been shown that another transition from the metal-type hyperbolic dispersion to dielectric-type hyperbolic dispersion can be realized in the microwave circuit-based metamaterials. Particularly, the transition point corresponds to a new class of metamaterials with two intersecting linear dispersions, which can be called linear-crossing metamaterials (LCMMs). Because of the linear dispersion, LCMMs have been demonstrated to possess many unusual properties such as directional propagation and slab-focusing with a partial cloaking effect. In this perspective, we will demonstrate that the multilayered structure composed of -negative material and mu -negative material can mimic the LCMM in the optical regime. Based on this effective LCMM, we study the slab-imaging with a partial cloaking effect. In addition, we reveal that with the aid of LCMM, the Bessel beam with self-healing can be realized by a point source. The results show that LCMMs would be very useful in a variety of applications such as 50/50 beam splitters, focusing and non-diffraction beams.

ABSTRACT: Bisignate circular dichroism, originated from the Cotton effect, with opposite signs of the chiroptical response is an indispensable property for protein sensing, drug discovery and design, and liquid crystallinity. However, naturally occurring and artificially synthetic chiral structures with random orientations in a bulk sample often exhibit ensemble-averaged bisignate circular dichroism in absorption with a magnitude less than 0.01. Even though vertically stacked achiral plasmonic nanostructures could enhance the absorption-based bisignate circular dichroism, the resonance nature of this approach restricts its magnitude less than 0.5. Here, a novel concept of non-absorption-based bisignate circular dichroism is demonstrated through the nonresonant angular momentum mode-sorting sensitivity of a single nanoring slit enclosed by a concentric plasmonic nanogroove coupler. Quasi-flat bisignate circular dichroism with a near-unity magnitude is achieved in the visible and near-infrared wavelength range. Additionally, the new bisignate circular dichroism reveals complete reversibility when the sign of the orbital angular momentum mode of incident light and of the geometrical topological charge of the nanogroove coupler is changed. This work opens exciting avenues for ultrasensitive angular momentum-dependent stereochemistry and may find promising applications in integrated photonics harnessing switchable chiroptical devices.

ABSTRACT: Using computer methods (the ToposPro software package), a combinatorial topological analysis and modeling of the self-assembly of the Sc96Mg8Zn600-cP704 (sp. gr. Pa-3 (no. 205), a = 22.4120 angstrom, V = 11 257.5 angstrom(3)) crystal structure is carried out. A new three-layer framework-forming nanocluster K65 = 0@3@20@42 is established. At the center of nanocluster K65 (in position 8c on the 3 axis), there is a ring of 3 Zn atoms inside the Zn-20 dodecahedron, on the surface of which 42 atomic shells of 12 Sc atoms and 30 Zn atoms are formed. The symmetry and topological code of the processes of self-assembly of 3D structures from nanoclusters-precursors K65 in the form primary chain -> microlayer -> microframework is reconstructed. The K5 = Mg2Zn3 (triangular bipyramids) and K6 = Zn-6 (hexagonal rings) clusters are established as spacers occupying the voids in the 3D framework of K65 nanoclusters.

ABSTRACT: Edge states are an important ingredient in understanding transport properties of graphene nanoribbons. We study experimentally the existence and the internal structure of edge states under uniaxial strain of the three main edges: zigzag, bearded, and armchair. The experiments are performed on artificial microwave graphene flakes, where the wavefunctions are obtained by direct imaging. We show that uniaxial strain can be used to manipulate the edge states: a single parameter controls their existence and their spatial extension into the ribbon. By combining a tight-binding approach and topological arguments, we provide an accurate description of our experimental findings. A new type of zero-energy state appearing at the intersection of two edges, namely the corner state, is also observed and discussed.

ABSTRACT: Flat bands play an important role in diffraction-free photonics and attract fundamental interest in manybody physics. Here we report the engineering of flat-band localization of collective excited states of atoms in Creutz superradiance lattices with tunable synthetic gauge fields. Magnitudes and phases of the lattice hopping coefficients can be independently tuned to control the state components of the flat band and the Aharonov-Bohm phases. We can selectively excite the flat band and control the flat-band localization with the synthetic gauge field. Our study provides a room-temperature platform for flat bands of atoms and holds promising applications in exploring correlated topological materials.

ABSTRACT: Time-asymmetric state evolution due to the dynamical encirclement around a second-order exceptional point has garnered enormous attention for the topological study of various photonic structures. The selective modeconversion in an optical waveguide can help in the designing of various integrated photonics devices. Here we explore a dual-mode planar optical waveguide and study the beam dynamics with the onset and offset of Kerr nonlinearity together with the encirclement of the identified exceptional point in the parameter space. The onset of the same amount of focusing and defocusing type nonlinearity in the waveguide gives two different outputs for a unidirectional propagation of light, beyond the chiral aspect of the device.

ABSTRACT: We apply a large-scale computational technique, known as topology optimization, to the inverse design of photonic Dirac cones. In particular, we report on a variety of photonic crystal geometries, realizable in simple isotropic dielectric materials, which exhibit dual-polarization Dirac cones. We present photonic crystals of different symmetry types, such as fourfold and sixfold rotational symmetries, with Dirac cones at different points within the Brillouin zone. The demonstrated and related optimization techniques open avenues to band-structure engineering and manipulating the propagation of light in periodic media, with possible applications to exotic optical phenomena such as effective zero-index media and topological photonics.

ABSTRACT: We study nonreciprocal photon blockade in cavity optomagnonics, where a sphere of ferromagnetic crystal supports two optical whispering-gallery modes and one magnon mode. The interaction in cavity optomagnonics is subject to the selection rules involving conservation of angular momentum and energy, and the selection rules introduce a nonreciprocal coupling between linearly polarized photons and magnons. For given incident linearly polarized photons, the photon blockade occurs when the cavity is driven in one direction, but it disappears if the cavity is driven in the opposite direction. The results suggest that cavity optomagnonics could be a promising platform for studying chiral quantum optics and topological photonics.

ABSTRACT: Plasmonic vortices have shown a wide range of applications in on-chip photonics due to their fascinating properties of the orbital angular momenta (OAM) and phase singularity. However, conventional devices to generate them suffer from issues of low efficiencies and limited functionalities. Here, we establish a systematic scheme to construct high-efficiency bifunctional metasurfaces that can generate two plasmonic vortices exhibiting distinct topological charges, based on a series of reflective meta-atoms exhibiting tailored reflection-phases dictated by both resonant and geometric origins. As a benchmark test, we first construct a meta-coupler with meta-atoms exhibiting geometric phases only, and experimentally demonstrate that it can generate a pre-designed plasmonic vortex at the wavelength of 1064 nm with an efficiency of 27% (56% in simulation). Next, we design/fabricate two bifunctional metasurfaces with meta-atoms integrated with both resonant and geometric phases, and experimentally demonstrate that they can generate divergent (or focused) or convergent (or defocused) plasmonic vortices with district OAM as shined by circularly polarized light with opposite helicity at 1064 nm wavelength. Our work provides an efficient platform to generate plasmonic vortices as desired, which can find many applications in on-chip photonics.

ABSTRACT: We review our attempt to tackle topological photonics based on an experimental platform operating in the microwave frequency range. The latter is based on a resonant metamaterial consisting in a dense collection of finite-length resonant metallic wires, known as the wire medium. Inside, the wave propagation is accurately described by a polariton, which exhibits subwavelength propagating modes as well as a hybridization bandgap. Thanks to a relevant design of the relative lengths of the wires and/or on their spatial positioning, we explore different aspects of topology applied to wave propagation.

ABSTRACT: Two-dimensional (2D) materials have generated great interest in the past few years opening up a new dimension in the development of optoelectronics and photonics. In this paper, we demonstrate 6.5 GHz fundamentally Q-switched mode-locked lasers with high performances in the femtosecond laser-written waveguide platform by applying graphene, MoS2 and Bi2Se3 as saturable absorbers (SAs). The minimum mode-locked pulse duration was measured to be as short as 26 ps in the case of Bi2Se3 SA. The maximum slope efficiency reached 53% in the case of MoS2 SA. This is the first demonstration of Q-switched mode-locked waveguide lasers based on MoS2 and Bi2Se3 in the waveguide platform. These high-performance Q-switched mode-locked waveguide lasers based on 2D materials pave the way for practical applications of compact ultrafast photonics.

ABSTRACT: Nonreciprocity is important in both optical information processing and topological photonics studies. Conventional principles for realizing nonreciprocity rely on magnetic fields, spatiotemporal modulation, or nonlinearity. Here we propose a generic principle for generating nonreciprocity by taking advantage of energy loss, which is usually regarded as harmful. The loss in a resonance mode induces a phase lag, which is independent of the energy transmission direction. When multichannel lossy resonance modes are combined, the resulting interference gives rise to nonreciprocity, with different coupling strengths for the forward and backward directions, and unidirectional energy transmission. This study opens a new avenue for the design of nonreciprocal devices without stringent requirements.

We study an InAs/GaSb double quantum well heterostructure with an AlSb barrier to decouple partially the 2D electrons and holes, and find conduction consistent with a 2D hole gas, with an effective mass of 0.235 +/- 0.005 m(0), existing simultaneously with hybridised carriers with an effective mass of 0.070 +/- 0.005 m(0), where m(0) is the bare electron mass.

ABSTRACT: Inspired by the innovations in photonics and nanotechnology, the remarkable properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials have renewed interest for the development of terahertz (THz) photodetectors. The versatility of these materials enables ultrafast and ultrasensitive photodetection of THz radiation at room temperature. The atomically thin characteristic together with van der Waals interactions among the layers make it easy to scaling down and integrate with other 2D materials based devices, as well as silicon chips. Efforts have increased fast in the past decade in developing proof-of-concept and the further prospective THz photodetectors based on 2D materials. Here, the recent progress on the exploring of THz photodetectors based on 2D materials is reviewed.

ABSTRACT: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) are resonant modes of open structures that do not suffer damping, despite being compatible with radiation in terms of their momentum. They have been raising significant attention for their intriguing topological features, and their opportunities in photonics to enhance light-matter interactions. In parallel, the coherent excitation of optical devices through the tailored interference of multiple beams has been explored as a way to enhance the degree of real-time control over their response. Here, we leverage the combination of these phenomena, and exploit the topological features of BICs in the presence of multiple input beams to enable full polarization control on the entire Poincare sphere in a photonic crystal slab only supporting a symmetry-protected BIC, experimentally demonstrating highly efficient polarization conversion controlled in real time through the superposition of coherent excitations. Our findings open exciting opportunities for a variety of photonic and quantum optics applications, benefitting from extreme wave interactions and topological features around BICs combined with optical control through coherent interference of multiple excitations. Polarization control is of paramount importance for various applications. Here, the authors enable extreme control over light polarization spanning the entire Poincare sphere by combining coherent control of wave phenomena and the physics of bound states in the continuum.

ABSTRACT: Topology plays an increasing role in physics beyond the realm of topological insulators in condensed mater. From geophysical fluids to active matter, acoustics or photonics, a growing family of systems presents topologically protected chiral edge modes. The number of such modes should coincide with the bulk topological invariant (e.g., Chern number) defined for a sample without boundary, in agreement with the bulk-edge correspondence. However, this is not always the case when dealing with continuous media where there is no small scale cutoff. The number of edge modes actually depends on the boundary condition, even when the bulk is properly regularized, showing an apparent paradox where the bulk-edge correspondence is violated. In this paper, we solve this paradox by showing that the anomaly is due to ghost edge modes hidden in the asymptotic part of the spectrum, which have a signature at finite frequency both in the local density of states and in a channel geometry. We provide a general formalism based on scattering theory to detect all edge modes properly, so that the bulk-edge correspondence is restored in a broader sense, implying in particular that chiral edge modes are not necessarily topological, and conversely. Our approach is illustrated through the odd-viscous shallow-water model and the massive Dirac Hamiltonian.

ABSTRACT: Second harmonic generation through nonlinear nano-photonic structures is important in both classical and quantum applications. It is commonly expected that the second harmonic frequency can always be generated as long as appropriate quadratic nonlinearity is provided by the material and the phase-matching condition is satisfied. Here, we present an anomaly to this common wisdom by showing that second-harmonic dipoles generated in a nonlinear photonic crystal slab can be completely nonradiative. As a result, no energy is transferred from the fundamental frequency to the second harmonic even when the phase-matching condition is satisfied - a phenomenon we call resonance-forbidden second-harmonic generation. Through numerical simulation, we identify two mechanisms that can achieve this phenomenon: symmetry protection and parameter tuning. The finite-size effect and the topological origin of this phenomenon are also discussed.

ABSTRACT: Three selected approaches for manipulation of light by complex nematic colloidal and non-colloidal structures are presented using different own custom developed theoretical and modelling approaches. Photonic crystals bands of distorted cholesteric liquid crystal helix and of nematic colloidal opals are presented, also revealing distinct photonic modes and density of states. Light propagation along half-integer nematic disclinations is shown with changes in the light polarization of various winding numbers. As third, simulated light transmission polarization micrographs of nematic torons are shown, offering a new insight into the complex structure characterization. Finally, this work is a contribution towards using complex soft matter in optics and photonics for advanced light manipulation.

ABSTRACT: On demand creation of topological defect configurations is a relevant topic for theoretical studies but also enables new developments in the field of photonics, stimuli-responsive actuators and colloidal assemblies. Liquid crystals (LCs) provide a versatile and technologically relevant material system to study topological defects, and photoalignment enables complex surface patterning that includes the formation of defects. This work is based on periodic defect grids of +1/2 and -1/2 defects, imposed at the top and bottom surface of a LC cell. The periods at the two substrates are slightly different and the azimuthal orientation of the defects is varied, so that different types of disclination interconnections are formed in the bulk of the LC. Some disclination lines connect defects at opposing substrates, while others connect defects on the same substrate. The experimentally generated configurations are simulated with the help of finite element Q-tensor simulations in order to get a detailed understanding of the defect formation. The optical appearance in polymerizing optical microscopy images is compared to optical simulations to verify the validity of the director configurations.

ABSTRACT: We introduce and investigate a novel Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beam, different from the conventional modal LG beams, which conserve the transverse intensity structure (up to scale) on propagation. The proposed beam does not conserve its structure on free space propagation but possesses some interesting properties. This beam is Fourier-invariant, and it has an increased dark area both in the initial (waist) plane and in the far field. Thus, without changing the topological charge of the beam, varying the radial (lower) index of the associated Laguerre polynomial allows increasing or decreasing the effective diameter of the central dark spot in the intensity pattern. In addition, the beam is autofocusing, i.e., the intensity distribution at the Rayleigh distance from the waist has a shape of the light ring (at any value of the radial index) with the minimal diameter and with the maximal on-ring intensity. Such a beam can be adopted for microparticle manipulation. Increasing the dark area in the focus of a high-aperture spherical lens allows the simultaneous trapping of several absorbing microparticles into this dark area.

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics have developed in recent years since the seminal discoveries of topological insulators in condensed matter physics for electrons. Among the numerous studies, photonic Weyl nodes have been studied very recently due to their intriguing surface Fermi arcs, Chiral zero modes and scattering properties. In this article, we propose a new design of an ideal photonic Weyl node metacrystal, meaning no excessive states are present at the Weyl nodes' frequency. The Weyl node is stabilized by the screw rotation symmetry of space group 19. Group theory analysis is utilized to reveal how the Weyl nodes are spawned from line nodes in a higher symmetry metacrystal of space group 61. The minimum four Weyl nodes' complex for time reversal invariant systems is found, which is a realistic photonic Weyl node metacrystal design compatible with standard printed circuit board techniques and is a complement to the few existing ideal photonic Weyl node designs and could be further utilized in studies of Weyl physics, for instance, Chiral zero modes and scatterings.

ABSTRACT: We consider the existence and spectral stability of nonlinear discrete localized solutions representing light pulses propagating in a twisted multicore optical fiber. By considering an even number, N, of waveguides, we derive asymptotic expressions for solutions in which the bulk of the light intensity is concentrated as soliton-like pulses confined to a single waveguide. The leading order terms obtained are in very good agreement with results of numerical computations. Furthermore, as in the model without temporal dispersion, when the twist parameter, phi, is given by phi=pi/N$\phi = \pi/N$, these standing waves exhibit optical suppression, in which a single waveguide remains unexcited, to leading order. Spectral computations and numerical evolution experiments suggest that these standing wave solutions are stable for values of the coupling parameter less than a critical value, at which point a spectral instability results from the collision of an internal eigenvalue with the eigenvalues at the origin. This critical value has a maximum when phi=pi/N$\phi = \pi/N$.

ABSTRACT: We apply a large-scale inverse design strategy based on topology optimization (TO) toward the automatic discovery of complex nanophotonic structures-new kinds of micropillars, photonic-cyrstal slabs, and waveguides comprising complicated arrangements of subwavelength dielectrics-exhibiting unusual nonlinear and spectral properties. The structures support multiple, tightly confined resonances at far-away wavelengths and exhibit the largest nonlinear confinement factors predicted thus far (oders of magnitude larger than state-of-the-art ring resonators or PhC cavities), leading to highly efficient nonlinear frequency conversion (NFC). The same TO approach can be exploited to design PhCs supporting dual-polarization, dual-wavelength, or highly degenerate Dirac cones, with implications to zero-index metamaterials, topological photonics, and exceptional points (EP).

ABSTRACT: Coherent vortex structures are fascinating physical objects that are widespread in nature: from large scale atmospheric phenomena, such as tornadoes and the Great Red Spot of Jupiter to microscopic size topological defects in quantum physics and optics. Unlike classical vortex dynamics in fluids, optical vortices feature new interesting properties. For instance, novel discrete optical vortices can be generated in photonic lattices, leading to new physics. In nonlinear optical media, vortices can be treated as solitons with nontrivial characteristics currently studied under the emerging field of topological photonics. Parallel to theoretical advances, new areas of the engineering applications based on light vortices have emerged. Examples include the possibility of carrying information coded in the vortex orbital angular momentum, understood as a spatial-division-multiplexing scheme, to the creation of optical tweezers for efficient manipulation of small objects. This report presents an overview highlighting some of the recent advances in the field of optical vortices with special attention on discrete vortex systems and related numerical methods for modeling propagation in multi-core fibers.

ABSTRACT: Bound states in the continuum in periodic photonic systems like photonic crystal slabs are proved to be accompanied by vortex polarization singularities on the photonic bands in the momentum space. The winding structures of polarization states not only widen the field of topological physics but also show great potential that such systems could be applied in polarization manipulating. In this Letter, we report the phenomenon that by in-plane inversion (C-2) symmetry breaking, pairs of circularly polarized states could spawn from the eliminated bound states in the continuum. Along with the appearance of the circularly polarized states as the two poles of the Poincare sphere together with linearly polarized states covering the equator, full coverage on the Poincare sphere could be realized. As an application, ellipticity modulation of linear polarization is demonstrated in the visible frequency range. This phenomenon provides a new degree of freedom in modulating polarization. The C points could also find applications in light-matter interactions. Further studying and manipulating the reported polarization singularities may lead to novel phenomena and physics in radiation modulating and topological photonics.

ABSTRACT: Weyl semimetals hold great promise in revolutionizing nonreciprocal optical components due to their unique topological properties. By exhibiting nonreciprocal magneto-optical effects without necessitating an external magnetic field, these materials offer remarkable miniaturization opportunities and reduced energy consumption. However, their intrinsic topological robustness poses a challenge for applications demanding tunability. In this work, we introduce an innovative approach to enhance the tunability of their response, utilizing multilayered configurations of twisted anisotropic Weyl semimetals. Our design enables controlled and reversible isolation by adjusting the twist angle between the anisotropic layers. When implemented in the Faraday geometry within the mid-IR frequency range, our design delivers impressive isolation, exceeding 50 dB, while maintaining a minimal insertion loss of just 0.33 dB. Moreover, the in-plane anisotropy of Weyl semimetals eliminates one or both polarizers of conventional isolator geometry, significantly reducing the overall dimensions. These results set the stage for creating highly adaptable, ultra-compact optical isolators that can propel the fields of integrated photonics and quantum technology applications to new heights.

ABSTRACT: In this work, we present the physical simulation of the dynamical and topological properties of atom-field quantum interacting systems by means of integrated quantum photonic devices. In particular, we simulate mechanical systems used, for example, for quantum processing and requiring a very complex technology such as a spin-1/2 particle interacting with an external classical time-dependent magnetic field and a two-level atom under the action of an external classical time-dependent electric (optical) field (light-matter interaction). The photonic device consists of integrated optical waveguides supporting two collinear or codirectional modes, which are coupled by integrated optical gratings. We show that the single-photon quantum description of the dynamics of this photonic device is a quantum physical simulation of both aforementioned interacting systems. The two-mode photonic device with a single-photon quantum state represents the quantum system, and the optical grating corresponds to an external field. Likewise, we also present the generation of Aharonov-Anandan geometric phases within this photonic device, which also appear in the simulated systems. On the other hand, this photonic simulator can be regarded as a basic brick for constructing more complex photonic simulators. We present a few examples where optical gratings interacting with several collinear and/or codirectional modes are used in order to illustrate the new possibilities for quantum simulation.

ABSTRACT: We propose the design of a planar dielectric metasurface to overcome the ohmic loss and discrete phase profile of metallic metasurfaces. The proposed metasurface is composed of annular subwavelength gratings, which can be taken regard as a space-variant Pancharatnam-Berry phase optical element. Consequently, the OAM-carrying beams with topological charge a = +/- 2 is generated with the efficiency high up to 90 %. In addition, we demonstrate a method to produce fractional, quasi-focusing, and quasi-non-diffracting OAM-carrying beams by adopting appropriate width modulation of the annular gratings. The proposed metasurfaces offering superiorities in high efficiency, phase continuity, and manipulative diversity may have potential applications in integrated-photonics and optical communication system.

ABSTRACT: "Photonic bound states in the continuum (BICs) are highly localized optical modes that have found important applications in lasers, sensors, modulators, and harmonic signal generators. While possessing a higher quality factor (Q) as compared to leaky photonic modes, regular BICs (e.g., either symmetry-protected or accidental BICs) normally require large cavity sizes and are usually sensitive to the fabrication imperfections that introduce lattice disorders. Moreover, the previous demonstrations of BIC lasers are mostly based on optical pumping and operated in the visible and near-infrared regimes. Here, an electrically pumped BIC laser is demonstrated by merging two types of BIC modes based on a quantum cascade chip in the terahertz (THz) regime, which has an ultra-compact size (with a pump area around 4 & lambda (2)). The measured side-mode suppression ratio (SMSR) can reach up to & AP 20 dB, indicating a good single-mode performance over the entire dynamic range. In addition, the emitted beam shows a nontrivial cylindrical vector beam profile, a typical topological feature of BIC lasers. This work would pave the way for practical use of the emerging BIC concepts in pursuing ultra-compact and high-performance electrically driven laser sources, which are highly desired in advanced optoelectronics and integrated photonics."

ABSTRACT: Future information technologies for low-dissipation quantum computation, high-speed storage, and on-chip communication applications require the development of atomically thin, ultracompact, and ultrafast spintronic devices in which information is encoded, stored, and processed using electron spin. Exploring low-dimensional magnetic materials, designing novel heterostructures, and generating and controlling ultrafast electron spin in 2D magnetism at room temperature, preferably in the unprecedented terahertz (THz) regime, is in high demand. Using THz emission spectroscopy driven by femtosecond laser pulses, optical THz spin-current bursts at room temperature in the 2D van der Waals ferromagnetic Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) integrated with Bi2Te3 as a topological insulator are successfully realized. The symmetry of the THz radiation is effectively controlled by the optical pumping incidence and external magnetic field directions, indicating that the THz generation mechanism is the inverse Edelstein effect contributed spin-to-charge conversion. Thickness-, temperature-, and structure-dependent nontrivial THz transients reveal that topology-enhanced interlayer exchange coupling increases the FGT Curie temperature to room temperature, which provides an effective approach for engineering THz spin-current pulses. These results contribute to the goal of all-optical generation, manipulation, and detection of ultrafast THz spin currents in room-temperature 2D magnetism, accelerating the development of atomically thin high-speed spintronic devices.

ABSTRACT: The magneto-optical effect breaks time-reversal symmetry, a unique property that makes it indispensable in nonreciprocal optics and topological photonics. Unfortunately, all natural materials have a rather weak magneto-optical response in the optical frequency range, posing a significant challenge to the practical application of many emerging device concepts. Here we theoretically propose a composite material system that exhibits an intrinsic magneto-optical response orders of magnitude stronger than most magneto-optical materials used today. This is achieved by tailoring the resonant interplay between the quantum electrodynamics of electronic transitions in two-level systems and the classical electromagnetic response of local plasmon resonance in metallic nanostructures.

ABSTRACT: Using the previously proposed spin-resolved near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) technique, we mapped the spin angular momentum (SAM) axial component (S-z) distributions of tightly focused linearly and circularly polarized vortex beams. The system's effectiveness was confirmed in our previous article by mapping various tightly focused cylindrical vector vortex beams. The SAM of different focused vortex light fields is essential in the research of near-field spin optics and topological photonics. The SAM distributions of different orders of linearly and circularly polarized vortex beams were mapped by separating their right spin (I-RCP) and left spin component (I-LCP) using the relationship S-z proportional to I-RCP-I-LCP.

ABSTRACT: Gapless surface states (SSs) are features of topological semimetals and are extensively observed. Nowadays, the emerging question is whether the SSs possess exotic and applicable properties. Here, associated with the symmetrical selection rule for nonlinear optical materials, the surface nonlinear optics on a centrosymmetric Dirac nodal-line semimetal ZrSiS crystal is studied and it is found that the SSs bring record nonlinear susceptibilities. The unprecedented conversion efficiencies for second and third harmonic generations are 0.11 parts per thousand and 0.43 parts per thousand, respectively, more than ten orders of magnitude larger than the typical surface second harmonic generation. This work discovers a new route toward studying the SSs for applications in nonlinear photonics.

ABSTRACT: Topologies associated with polarization point and line singularities can provide tools for controlling light propagation. By using the Stokes parameter, we demonstrate the emergence of polarization singularities hidden in deep subwavelength confined electromagnetic fields with angular momentum. We show that when the incoming orbital angular momentum is appropriately chosen, highly confined electromagnetic fields with super-diffraction-limited spatial dimensions can be obtained. At the same time, a conversion of orbital to spin angular momentum occurs, leading to a non-trivial topology. Our method provides a platform for developing topological photonics and studying the behavior of polarization singularities under strong focusing.

ABSTRACT: In this paper, we present a novel technique for beam shaping and mode conversion of elliptical laser beams employing vortex phase elements. We show that a vortex phase element with topological charge m=1 can effectively switch between elliptically shaped fundamental TEM00 mode and TEM01 mode. When used with a spatial light modulator, the proposed technique allows beam shape adjustments by applying electrical control signals. Compared to existing static mode conversion techniques, the presented technique may perform dynamic switching between the different laser modes. The developed technique may have several practical applications in the fields of photonics and laser optics, including beam splitters and interferometers, fiber lasers, high speed optical modulators, and optical tweezers.

ABSTRACT: The Mobius strip, a fascinating loop structure with one-sided topology, provides a rich playground for manipulating the non-trivial topological behaviour of spinning particles, such as electrons, polaritons and photons, in both real and parameter spaces. For photons resonating in a Mobius-strip cavity, the occurrence of an extra phase-known as the Berry phase-with purely topological origin is expected due to its non-trivial evolution in parameter space. However, despite numerous theoretical investigations, characterizing the optical Berry phase in a Mobius-strip cavity has remained elusive. Here we report the experimental observation of the Berry phase generated in optical Mobius-strip microcavities. In contrast to theoretical predictions in optical, electronic and magnetic Mobius-topology systems where only Berry phase pi occurs, we demonstrate that a variable Berry phase smaller than pi can be acquired by generating elliptical polarization of resonating light. Mobius-strip microcavities as integrable and Berry-phase-programmable optical systems are of great interest in topological physics and emerging classical or quantum photonic applications.

We survey several important non-Hermitian lattice designs, as well as the photonics platforms on which they can be realized.

ABSTRACT: High-index dielectric nanostructures can support optical resonances of electric and magnetic character with ultralow linear absorption. In contrast to plasmonics, they can be engineered to confine electromagnetic fields inside the resonator, amplifying intrinsic non-linearities of the dielectric. In this Review I examine the ability of dielectric nanoantennas and metasurfaces for efficient harmonic generation and wave-mixing processes, as well as nonlinear wavefront manipulation of the incident and radiated light. A detailed comparison is made between the many nanoscopic dielectric configurations reported in the literature, evaluating the influence of the material, crystal symmetry, structure geometry, and the different resonances involved (electric and magnetic Mie modes, Fano resonances, and quasi-nonradiative states, including anapoles and quasi-bound states in the continuum). The nonlinear performance of the nanosystems is analyzed, with emphasis on frequency conversion efficiency and emission directionality control, also discussing recent advances in nonlinear imaging, nonlinear holography, and all-optical switching. The role of topology in nonlinear nanophotonics is reviewed in the end, and potential future directions in the field are laid out.

ABSTRACT: "The topological protection of wave transport, originally observed in the context of the quantum Hall effect in two-dimensional electron gases(1), has been shown to apply broadly to a range of physical platforms, including photonics(2-5), ultracold atoms in optical lattices(6-8) and others(9-12). That said, the behaviour of such systems can be very different from the electronic case, particularly when interparticle interactions or nonlinearity play a major role(13-22). A Thouless pump(23) is a one-dimensional model that captures the topological quantization of transport in the quantum Hall effect using the notion of dimensional reduction: an adiabatically, time-varying potential mathematically maps onto a momentum coordinate in a conceptual second dimension(24-34). Importantly, quantization assumes uniformly filled electron bands below a Fermi energy, or an equivalent occupation for non-equilibrium bosonic systems. Here we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate quantized nonlinear Thouless pumping of photons with a band that is decidedly not uniformly occupied. In our system, nonlinearity acts to quantize transport via soliton formation and spontaneous symmetry-breaking bifurcations. Quantization follows from the fact that the instantaneous soliton solutions centred upon a given unit cell are identical after each pump cycle, up to translation invariance  this is an entirely different mechanism from traditional Thouless pumping. This result shows that nonlinearity and interparticle interactions can induce quantized transport and topological behaviour without a linear counterpart. Nonlinearity is shown to induce quantized topological transport via soliton motion  specifically, we demonstrate nonlinear Thouless pumping of photons in waveguide arrays with a non-uniformly occupied energy band."

ABSTRACT: The extraordinary responsiveness and large diversity of self-assembled structures of liquid crystals are well documented and they have been extensively used in devices like displays. For long, this application route strongly influenced academic research, which frequently focused on the performance of liquid crystals in display-like geometries, typically between flat, rigid substrates of glass or similar solids. Today a new trend is clearly visible, where liquid crystals confined within curved, often soft and flexible, interfaces are in focus. Innovation in microfluidic technology has opened for high-throughput production of liquid crystal droplets or shells with exquisite monodispersity, and modern characterization methods allow detailed analysis of complex director arrangements. The introduction of electrospinning in liquid crystal research has enabled encapsulation in optically transparent polymeric cylinders with very small radius, allowing studies of confinement effects that were not easily accessible before. It also opened the prospect of functionalizing textile fibers with liquid crystals in the core, triggering activities that target wearable devices with true textile form factor for seamless integration in clothing. Together, these developments have brought issues center stage that might previously have been considered esoteric, like the interaction of topological defects on spherical surfaces, saddle-splay curvature-induced spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, or the non-trivial shape changes of curved liquid crystal elastomers with non-uniform director fields that undergo a phase transition to an isotropic state. The new research thrusts are motivated equally by the intriguing soft matter physics showcased by liquid crystals in these unconventional geometries, and by the many novel application opportunities that arise when we can reproducibly manufacture these systems on a commercial scale. This review attempts to summarize the current understanding of liquid crystals in spherical and cylindrical geometry, the state of the art of producing such samples, as well as the perspectives for innovative applications that have been put forward.

ABSTRACT: Higher-order topological insulators are unusual materials that can support topologically protected states, whose dimensionality is lower than the dimensionality of the structure at least by 2. Among the most intriguing examples of such states are zero-dimensional corner modes existing in two-dimensional higher-order insulators. In contrast to corner states, recently discovered disclination states also belong to the class of higher-order topological states but are bound to the boundary of the disclination defect of the higher-order topological insulator and can be predicted using the bulk-disclination correspondence principle. Here, we present the first example of the nonlinear photonic disclination state bifurcating from its linear counterpart in the disclination lattice with a pentagonal or heptagonal core. We show that nonlinearity allows us to tune the location of the disclination states in the bandgap and notably affects their shapes. The structure of the disclination lattice is crucial for the stability of these nonlinear topological states: for example, disclination states are stable in the heptagonal lattice and are unstable nearly in the entire gap of the pentagonal lattice. Nonlinear disclination states reported here are thresholdless and can be excited even at low powers. Nonlinear zero-energy states coexisting in these structures with disclination states are also studied. Our results suggest that disclination lattices can be used in the design of various nonlinear topological functional devices, while disclination states supported by them may play an important role in applications, where strong field confinement together with topological protection are important, such as the design of topological lasers and enhancement of generation of high harmonics.

ABSTRACT: Topological physics relies on the structure of the eigenstates of the Hamiltonians. The geometry of the eigenstates is encoded in the quantum geometric tensor(1)-comprising the Berry curvature(2) (crucial for topological matter)(3) and the quantum metric(4), which defines the distance between the eigenstates. Knowledge of the quantum metric is essential for understanding many phenomena, such as superfluidity in flat bands(5), orbital magnetic susceptibility(6,7), the exciton Lamb shift(8) and the non-adiabatic anomalous Hall effect(6,9). However, the quantum geometry of energy bands has not been measured. Here we report the direct measurement of both the Berry curvature and the quantum metric in a two-dimensional continuous medium-a high-finesse planar microcavity(10)-together with the related anomalous Hall drift. The microcavity hosts strongly coupled exciton-photon modes (exciton polaritons) that are subject to photonic spin-orbit coupling(11) from which Dirac cones emerge(12), and to exciton Zeeman splitting, breaking time-reversal symmetry. The monopolar and half-skyrmion pseudospin textures are measured using polarization-resolved photoluminescence. The associated quantum geometry of the bands is extracted, enabling prediction of the anomalous Hall drift, which we measure independently using high-resolution spatially resolved epifluorescence. Our results unveil the intrinsic chirality of photonic modes, the cornerstone of topological photonics(13-15). These results also experimentally validate the semiclassical description of wavepacket motion in geometrically non-trivial bands(9,16). The use of exciton polaritons (interacting photons) opens up possibilities for future studies of quantum fluid physics in topological systems.

ABSTRACT: Photonic systems can exploit time as a degree of freedom analogous to space, eliminating the need for spatial patterning to achieve functionality. A Green's function approach allows the design of disordered time scatterers with desired properties. Recently, there has been increasing interest in the temporal degree of freedom in photonics due to its analogy with spatial axes, causality and open-system characteristics. In particular, the temporal analogues of photonic crystals have allowed the design of momentum gaps and their extension to topological and non-Hermitian photonics. Although recent studies have also revealed the effect of broken discrete time-translational symmetry in view of the temporal analogy of spatial Anderson localization, the broad intermediate regime between time order and time uncorrelated disorder has not been examined. Here we theoretically investigate the inverse design of photonic time disorder to achieve optical functionalities in spatially homogeneous platforms. By developing the structure factor and order metric using causal Green's functions for disorder in the time domain, we propose an engineered time scatterer, which provides unidirectional scattering with controlled scattering amplitudes. We also show that the order-to-disorder transition in the time domain allows the manipulation of scattering bandwidths, which makes resonance-free temporal colour filtering possible. Our work could advance optical functionalities without spatial patterning.

ABSTRACT: Metamaterials with classical analogues of electromagnetically induced transparency open new avenues in photonics for realizing smaller, more efficient slow light devices without quantum approaches. However, most of the metamaterial-based slow light devices are passive, which limits their practical applications. Here, by combining diatomic metamaterials with a gated single-layer graphene, we demonstrate that the group delay of terahertz light can be dynamically controlled under a small gate voltage. Using a two coupled harmonic oscillators model, we show that this active control of group delay is made possible by an effective control of the dissipative loss of the radiative dark resonator by varying the graphene's optical conductivity. Our work may provide opportunities in the design of various applications such as compact slow light devices and ultrasensitive sensors and switches.

ABSTRACT: Using an array of coupled microwave resonators arranged in a deformed honeycomb lattice, we experimentally observe the formation of pseudo-Landau levels in the whole crossover from vanishing to large pseudomagnetic field strengths. This result is achieved by utilising an adaptable setup in a geometry that is compatible with the pseudo-Landau levels at all field strengths. The adopted approach enables us to observe the fully formed flat-band pseudo-Landau levels spectrally as sharp peaks in the photonic density of states and image the associated wavefunctions spatially, where we provide clear evidence for a characteristic nodal structure reflecting the previously elusive supersymmetry in the underlying low-energy theory. In particular, we resolve the full sublattice polarisation of the anomalous 0th pseudo-Landau level, which reveals a deep connection to zigzag edge states in the unstrained case. Photonics: Deepening our understanding of a material's topological statesA deeper understanding of how the topological states of graphene-like structures affect their optical properties could pave the way for applications such as flat-band lasers and novel sensors. A material's topological state can provide it with unusual properties. For example, topological insulators can act as insulators in their interior but allow currents to flow in opposite directions on their surface. Similar properties can also be engineered into optical systems. Combining theory led by Henning Schomerus from Lancaster University in the United Kingdom, and experiments carried out by Matthieu Bellec and Fabrice Mortessagne from Universite Cote d'Azur in France, a team of researchers has demonstrated how the application of a deformation in a photonic analogue of graphene results in the formation of pseudo-Landau levels. The work shows that the material's edge and bulk properties and sub-lattice polarisation are directly linked and provides a unifying principle that connects a wide variety of topological phenomena.

ABSTRACT: An exceptional point (EP) arises when both the eigenvectors and eigenvalues coalesce, which in a physical system can be achieved by engineering the gain and loss coefficients, leading to a wide variety of counterintuitive phenomena. In photonic systems, the loss and gain are generally realized by the special design of the samples. Light-matter hybrid exciton polaritons, however, are inherent non-Hermitian systems in which EPs can be approached easier such as in virtue of nonlinearity. In this work we demonstrate the existence of an EP in an exciton polariton condensate in a double-well potential. Near the EP, the polariton condensate localized in one potential well can be switched off by an additional optical excitation in the other well with very low (far below threshold) power, which surprisingly induces additional loss into the system. Increasing the power of the additional laser leads to a situation in which gain dominates in both wells again, such that the polaritons recondense in the two potential wells. The switching off near the EP can also be realized by the polariton nonlinearity induced blueshift in the same structure. Our results offer a simple way to optically manipulate the polariton condensation process in a double-well potential. Extending such a configuration to complex potential well lattices offers exciting prospects to explore high-order EPs and non-Hermitian topological photonics in a nonequilibrium many-body system.

ABSTRACT: We propose a new method to detect the orbital angular momentum(OAM) of Bessel vortex beams by an elliptical screen covering the partical azimuth angle. When the diffraction screen is illuminated with a vortex beam, the far-filed diffraction pattern can be used to determine the modulus and sign of topological charges. It was found that the diffraction patterns can best reflect the topological charge information when the angle of initial position is set as 8 degrees and span angle of opaque region of the ellipse aperture is set as 4 degrees. The simulation results show that the number of dark fringes denotes the number of topological charge. The sign of topological charge is determined by the direction of intensity pattern, which flips by 180 degrees for a change in the sign of topological charge. This new method to detect of vortex beam topological charge information is very simple and low-cost.

ABSTRACT: Orbital angular momentum (OAM) has emerged as an important parameter to store, control, and transport information using light. Recognizing optical beams that carry OAM at the nanoscale and their interaction with subwavelength nanostructures has turned out to be a vital task in nanophotonic signal processing and communication. The current platforms to decode information from different OAM modes are mainly based on bulk optics and requires sophisticated nanofabrication procedures. Motivated by these issues, herein we report on the utility of chemically prepared, individual plasmonic nanowire for OAM read-out. Our method is based on pattern recognition of coherent light scattering from individual nanowires that can be used as direct read-outs of two parameters of an OAM beam: magnitude of topological charge and its sign. All the experimental observations related to pattern formation are corroborated by three-dimensional numerical simulations. Given that pattern formation and recognition are exhaustively utilized in various computational domains, we envisage that our results can be interfaced with machine-learning methods, wherein direct read-out of OAM signals can be performed without human intervention. Such methods may have a direct implication on chip-scale robotics and chiral nanophotonic interfaces.

ABSTRACT: We explore a single degenerate optical cavity supporting a synthetic two-dimensional space, which includes the frequency and the orbital angular momentum (OAM) axes of light. We create the effective gauge potential inside this synthetic space and show that the system exhibits topologically protected one-way edge states along the OAM axis at the boundaries of the frequency dimension. in this synthetic space, we present a robust generation and manipulation of entanglement between the frequency and OAM of photons. Our Letter shows that a higher-dimensional synthetic space involving multiple degrees of freedom of light can be achieved in a zero-dimensional spatial structure, pointing towards a unique platform to explore topological photonics and to realize potential applications in optical communications and quantum information processing.

ABSTRACT: We report on lasing at visible wavelengths in arrays of ferromagnetic Ni nanodisks overlaid with an organic gain medium. We demonstrate that by placing an organic gain material within the mode volume of the plasmonic nanoparticles both the radiative and, in particular, the high ohmic losses of Ni nanodisk resonances can be compensated. Under increasing pump fluence, the systems exhibit a transition from lattice-modified spontaneous emission to lasing, the latter being characterized by highly directional and sub-nanometer line width emission. By breaking the symmetry of the array, we observe tunable multimode lasing at two wavelengths corresponding to the particle periodicity along the two principal directions of the lattice. Our results are relevant for loss-compensated magnetoplasmonic devices and topological photonics.

ABSTRACT: We present an overview of gauge fields in spintronics, focusing on their origin and physical consequences. Important topics, such as the Berry gauge field associated with adiabatic quantum evolution as well as gauge fields arising from other non-adiabatic considerations, are discussed. We examine the appearance and effects of gauge fields across three spaces, namely real-space, momentum-space, and time, taking on a largely semiclassical approach. We seize the opportunity to study other spin-like systems, including graphene, topological insulators, magnonics, and photonics, which emphasize the ubiquity and importance of gauge fields. We aim to provide an intuitive and pedagogical insight into the role played by gauge fields in spin transport. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics. [doi: 10.1063/1.3665219]

ABSTRACT: All-optical switches are among the most important parts of integrated photonics. Ultrahigh speed and ultralow energy consumption are two necessary indexes of all-optical switches. Traditionally, all-optical switches are based on concepts such as micro-ring resonators, surface plasmon polaritons, photonic crystals, and metamaterials. However, such platforms cannot satisfy the demand for high performance of all-optical switches. To overcome the limited response time and energy consumption, recent studies have introduced new applications of such physics as parity-time symmetry, exceptional points, topological insulators, and bound states in a continuum. Such physical concepts not only provide promising research avenues for the all-optical switch but also broaden the design channel. This is expected to achieve ultracompact, ultrafast, and high-capacity all-optical information processing.

ABSTRACT: It is predicted theoretically that a 1D diatomic chain of 3D chiral cells can support a topological bandgap that allows for translating a small time-harmonic axial movement at one end of the chain into a resonantly enhanced large rotation of an edge state at the other end. This edge state is topologically protected such that an arbitrary mass of a mirror at the other end does not shift the eigenfrequency out of the bandgap. Herein, this complex 3D laser-beam-scanner microstructure is realized in fused-silica form. A novel microcasting approach is introduced that starts from a hollow polymer cast made by standard 3D laser nanoprinting. The cast is evacuated and filled with helium, such that a highly viscous commercial glass slurry is sucked in. After UV curing and thermal debinding of the polymer, the fused-silica glass is sintered at 1225 degrees C under vacuum. Detailed optical measurements reveal a mechanical quality factor of the twist-edge resonance of 2850 at around 278 kHz resonance frequency under ambient conditions. The microcasting approach can likely be translated to many other glasses, to metals and ceramics, and to complex architectures that are not or not yet amenable to direct 3D laser printing.

ABSTRACT: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have become one of the essential types of materials for organic electronics and bio-photonics, such as organic field-effect transistors, organic solar cells, bio-imaging, and cancer therapy. Acenaphthylene-imide (AnI)-fused PAHs with the inherent large pi-conjugated framework and electron-deficient imide moiety endow molecules low-lying LUMO energy levels for n-type organic semiconductors. In this review, the recent development of AnI-fused PAHs as organic semiconductors will be summarized, the synthetic methodology and the relationship between the molecular structures and properties (photophysical properties and/or devices performances) will be discussed in details. And it is believed to be helpful for further molecular design of AnI-fused PAHs with novel topological structures as functional materials.

ABSTRACT: The wide-range application of photonic crystals and metamaterials benefits from the enormous design space of three-dimensional subwavelength structures. In this Letter, we study the space group constraints on photonic dispersions for all 230 space groups with time-reversal symmetry. Our theory carefully treats the unique singular point of photonic bands at zero frequency and momentum, which distinguishes photonic bands from their electronic counterpart. The results are given in terms of minimal band connectivities at zero (M) and nonzero frequencies (M'). Topological band degeneracies are guaranteed to be found in space groups that do not allow band gaps between the second and third photonic bands (M > 2). Our Letter provides theoretical guidelines for the choice of spatial symmetries in photonics design.

ABSTRACT: We report strong terahertz (similar to 10(12) Hz) high harmonic generation at room temperature in thin films of Cd3As2, a three-dimensional Dirac semimetal. Third harmonics are detectable with a tabletop light source and can be as strong as 100 V/cm by applying a fundamental field of 6.5 kV/cm inside the film, demonstrating an unprecedented efficiency for terahertz frequency conversion. Our time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy and calculations also clarify the microscopic mechanism of the nonlinearity originating in the coherent acceleration of Dirac electrons in momentum space. Our results provide clear insights for nonlinear currents of Dirac electrons driven by the terahertz field under the influence of scattering, paving the way toward novel devices for high-speed electronics and photonics based on topological semimetals.

ABSTRACT: "Optical singularities play a major role in modern optics and are frequently deployed in structured light, superresolution microscopy, and holography. While phase singularities are uniquely defined as locations of undefined phase, polarization singularities studied thus far are either partial, i.e., bright points of well-defined polarization, or are unstable for small field perturbations. We demonstrate a complete, topologically protected polarization singularity  it is located in the four-dimensional space spanned by the three spatial dimensions and the wavelength and is created in the focus of a cascaded metasurface-lens system. The field Jacobian plays a key role in the design of such higher-dimensional singularities, which can be extended to multidimensional wave phenomena, and pave the way for unconventional applications in topological photonics and precision sensing."

ABSTRACT: The introduction of non-Hermiticity into photonics has enabled new design principles for photonic devices. Here we propose the design of a tunable non-Hermitian on-chip mode converter working at telecommunication wavelengths. The key component of the converter is a phase change material, and switching its working state can enable a topological change in the energy surface of the system. The conversion functionality can be realized by dynamically encircling an exceptional point in the parameter space of the device. The device based on this non-Hermitian principle is robust to perturbations of structural parameters and works in broadband. The non-Hermitian principle can be applied for the design of more complex on-chip photonic devices. (C) 2020 Optical Society of America

ABSTRACT: The magneto-optical effect breaks time-reversal symmetry, a unique property that makes it indispensable in nonreciprocal optics and topological photonics. Unfortunately, all natural materials have a rather weak magneto-optical response in the optical frequency range, posing a significant challenge to the practical application of many emerging device concepts. Here, we theoretically propose a composite material system that exhibits an intrinsic magneto-optical response orders of magnitude stronger than most magneto-optical materials used today. This is achieved by tailoring the resonant interplay between the quantum electrodynamics of electronic transitions in two-level systems and the classical electromagnetic response of local plasmon resonance.

ABSTRACT: Polarization singularities in momentum space, including bound states in the continuum (BICs) and circularly polarized states (CPSs), render great potential in singular and chiral optics. As far-field topological signatures of Bloch modes in photonic crystal slab, the dynamic evolution of the polarization singularities is observed by tuning the geometric parameters of the slab itself. Here, we combine the photonic crystal slab with a reflected multilayer substrate in which interference between the reflected optical field and the upward radiation of the Bloch mode brings us an extra degree of freedom to manipulate the polarization singularities without breaking the structural symmetry. As the polarization singularities evolve with the spacing between the photonic crystal slab and the substrate, the CPSs and extrinsic BICs are both generated from charge reversal of the at -P intrinsic BIC and then collide with the off -P intrinsic BICs. Importantly, all BICs are topologically protected from splitting throughout the whole dynamic process owing to the preservation of structural symmetry. Our findings suggest an alternative route to pursue ultrahigh -Q CPS resonances and merge diverse BICs, which is potentially applicable in chiral optics, topological photonics, and beam modulation.

ABSTRACT: Excitation of hybrid modes constituted by different material-supported polaritons is a common way to enhance the near-field radiative energy transport, which has fascinating promise in applications of thermal photonics. Here, we investigate near-field thermal radiation mechanisms in heterostructure composed of hBN film and black phosphorus single layer. The results show that this heterostructured system can give rise to a remarkable enhancement for photon tunneling, outperforming the near-field thermal radiation properties of its building blocks, as well as some other representative heterostructures. Moreover, we find that the anisotropic hybrid effect can induce a remarkable topological reconstitution of polaritons for hBN film and black phosphorus, forming a novel anisotropic hybrid polaritons. Notably, such hybrid modes show significant topological differences compared to hBN film and black phosphorus in the type-I Reststrahlen band due to the anisotropic anticrossing hybridization effect. Lastly, we systematically analyze the evolution of such hybrid polariton modes as a function of hBN film thickness and the corresponding influence on radiative properties of the heterostructure. This work may benefit the applications of near-field energy harvesting and radiative cooling based on hybrid polaritons in anisotropic two-dimensional material and hyperbolic film.

ABSTRACT: Access to the transverse spin of light has unlocked new regimes in topological photonics. To achieve the transverse spin from nonzero longitudinal fields, various platforms that derive transversely confined waves based on focusing, interference, or evanescent waves have been suggested. Nonetheless, because of the transverse confinement inherently accompanying sign reversal of the field derivative, the resulting transverse spin handedness of each field experiences spatial inversion, which leads to a mismatch between the intensities of the field and its spin component and hinders the global observation of the transverse spin. Here, we reveal a globally pure transverse spin of the electric field in which the field intensity signifies the spin distribution. Starting from the target spin mode for the inverse design of required spatial profiles of anisotropic permittivities, we show that the elliptic-hyperbolic transition around the epsilon-near-zero permittivity allows for the global conservation of transverse spin handedness of the electric field across the topological interface between anisotropic metamaterials. Extending to the non-Hermitian regime, we develop annihilated transverse spin modes to cover the entire Poincare sphere of the meridional plane. This result realizes the complete optical analogy of three-dimensional quantum spin states.

ABSTRACT: "Topological photonics is a hot topic in recent years. We combine it with the quantum optics and explore the dynamics of two quantum dots (QDs) separated by the finite coupled-cavity arrays (CCAs). The finite CCAs possessing the alternating hopping strengths will lead to the existence of the topological protected edge modes, also called zero energy modes, when the boundaries leave the weak hopping at two ends. Due to the two edge modes, i.e., symmetric and antisymmetric, with nearly degenerate frequencies, the dynamics of two QDs coupled to the cavities at both ends exhibit complicated behaviors. When the CCAs are composed of a large number of cavities, there are two kinds of phenomena: if the coupling between QDs and cavity is weak, two edge modes will cancel each other out and isolate two QDs deeply  if the coupling between QDs and cavities is large compared with hopping strength, the edge mode disappears and two QDs can be connected through extend modes. Importantly, when the CCAs are formed by a small number of cavities, energy can be transferred to each other between two QDs through the edge modes. Such energy transfer is topologically protected, and the period is long and easily controlled. We also investigate the effects of topologically protected quantum entangled states on such system and find that the quantum entanglement can be well kept or generated for appropriate choices of system parameters and initial states. The investigations enrich the manifestation of topological physics and are helpful to apply the topological protection to quantum computation and quantum communication.

ABSTRACT: Topology and symmetry have emerged as compelling guiding principles to predict and harness the propagation of waves in natural and artificial materials. Be it for quantum particles (such as electrons) or classical waves (such as light, sound or mechanical motion), these concepts have so far been mostly developed in idealized scenarios, in which the wave amplitude is neither attenuated nor amplified, and time evolution is unitary. In recent years, however, there has been a considerable push to explore the consequences of topology and symmetries in non-conservative, non-equilibrium or non-Hermitian systems. A plethora of driven artificial materials has been reported, blurring the lines between a wide variety of fields in physics and engineering, including condensed matter, photonics, phononics, optomechanics, as well as electromagnetic and mechanical metamaterials. Here we discuss the latest advances, emerging opportunities and open challenges for combining these exciting research endeavours into the new pluridisciplinary field of non-Hermitian topological systems. The interplay of topological properties and non-Hermitian symmetry breaking has been implemented for a range of classical-wave systems. Recent advances, challenges and opportunities are reviewed across the different physical platforms.

ABSTRACT: Non-Hermitian physics, an active topic in photonics, is also being increasingly extended to investigate the band topologies of condensed-matter systems. Here, the authors report a 2D non-Hermitian model exhibiting exceptional rings and topological boundary modes in the spectral degeneracy, they propose how to realise these features using topolectrical circuits. Energy conservation is not valid in non-Hermitian systems with gain/loss or non-reciprocity, which leads to various extraordinary resonant characteristics. Compared with Hermitian systems, the intersection of non-Hermitian physics and topology generates new phases that have not been observed in condensed-matter systems before. Here, utilizing the designed two-dimensional periodical model with non-reciprocal hopping terms, we show how to obtain both the ellipse-like or hyperbolic-like spectral degeneracy, the topological boundary modes and the bulk-boundary correspondence by the protection of time-reversal symmetry and pseudo-Hermitian symmetry. Notably, the boundary modes and bulk-boundary correspondence can simultaneously appear only for specific selection of the primitive cell, and we explored the analytical solution to verify such gauge-dependent topological behaviors. Our topolectrical circuit simulation provides a flexible approach to confirm the designed properties and clarify the crucial role of pseudo-Hermiticity on the stability of a practical system. In a broader view, our findings can be compared to other platforms such as meta-surface or photonic crystals, for the purpose on the control of resonant frequency and localization properties.

ABSTRACT: We propose a two-dimensional non-Hermitian Chern insulator with inversion symmetry, which is anisotropic and has staggered gain and loss in both x and y directions. In this system, conventional bulk-boundary correspondence holds. The Chern number is a topological invariant that accurately predicts the topological phase transition and the existence of helical edge states in the topologically nontrivial gapped phase. In the gapless phase, the band touching points are isolated and protected by the symmetry. The degenerate points alter the system topology, and the exceptional points can destroy the existence of helical edge states. Topologically protected helical edge states exist in the gapless phase for the system under open boundary condition in one direction, which are predicted by the winding number associated with the vector field of average values of Pauli matrices. The winding number also identifies the detaching points between the edge states and the bulk states in the energy bands. The non-Hermiticity also supports a topological phase with zero Chern number, where a pair of in-gap helical edge states exists. Our findings provide insights into the symmetry protected non-Hermitian topological insulators.

ABSTRACT: Non-Hermitian skin effect(NHSE) describes a unique non-Hermitian phenomenon that all eigen-modes are localized near the boundary, and has profound impact on a wide range of bulk properties. In particular, topological systems with NHSE have stimulated extensive research interests recently, given the fresh theoretical and experimental challenges therein. Here we propose a readily implementable scheme for achieving NHSE with band topology in ultracold gases. Specifically, the scheme realizes the one-dimensional optical Raman lattice with two types of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and an additional laser-induced dissipation. By tuning the dissipation and the SOC strengths, NHSE and band topology can be individually controlled such that they can coexist in a considerable parameter regime. To identify the topological phase in the presence of NHSE, we have restored the bulk-boundary correspondence by invoking the non-Bloch band theory, and discussed the dynamic signals for detection. Our work serves as a guideline for engineering topological lattices with NHSE in the highly tunable environment of cold atoms, paving the way for future studies of exotic non-Hermitian physics in a genuine quantum many-body setting. The non-Hermitian skin effect comprises of boundary localised eigenmodes and has been realised in a range of 1D systems such as photonics and metamaterials. Here, the authors achieve the same effect in a quantum many-body setting using ultra-cold gases and, by tuning the strength of the spin orbit coupling, realise a non-trivial band topology.

ABSTRACT: Bismuth selenide (Bi2Se3), a new topological insulator, has attracted much attention in recent years owing to its relatively simple band structure and large bulk band gap. Compared to bulk, few-layer Bi2Se3 is recently considered as a highly promising material. Here, we use a liquid-phase exfoliation method to prepare few-layer Bi2Se3 in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone or chitosan acetic solution. The resulted few-layer Bi2Se3 dispersion demonstrates an interesting absorption in the visible light region, which is different from bulk Bi2Se3 without any absorption in this region. The absorption spectrum of few-layer Bi2Se3 depends on its size and layer number. At the same time, the nonlinear and saturable absorption of few-layer Bi2Se3 thin film in near infrared is also characterized well and further exploited to generate laser pulses by a passive Q-switching technique. Stable Q-switched operation is achieved with a lower pump threshold of 9.3 mW at 974 nm, pulse energy of 39.8 nJ and a wide range of pulse-repetition-rate from 6.2 to 40.1 kHz. Therefore, the few-layer Bi2Se3 may excite a potential applications in laser photonics and optoelectronic devices.

ABSTRACT: Optical networking is fast evolving towards the applications of the Software-defined Networking (SDN) paradigm down to the (Wavelength-division Multiplexing) WDM transport layer for cost-effective and flexible infrastructure management. Optical SDN requires each network element's software abstraction to enable full control by the centralized network controller. Nowadays, modern network elements, especially photonic switching systems, are developed by exploiting the fast-emerging technology of Photonic Integrated Circuit (PIC) that consists of complex fabrics of elementary units that can be driven individually using a large set of elementary controls. In this work, we focus on modeling the elementary control states of the topological structures behind PIC N x N switches under a fully blind approach based on Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The ML agent's training and testing datasets are obtained synthetically by software simulation of the photonic switch structure. The proposed technique's scalability and accuracy are validated by considering different dimensions N and applying it to two different switching topologies: the Honey-Comb Rearrangeable Optical Switch and the Benes network. Excellent results in terms of prediction of the control states are achieved for both of the considered topologies.

ABSTRACT: We report the realization of a synthetic magnetic field for photons and polaritons in a honeycomb lattice of coupled semiconductor micropillars. A strong synthetic field is induced in both the s and p orbital bands by engineering a uniaxial hopping gradient in the lattice, giving rise to the formation of Landau levels at the Dirac points. We provide direct evidence of the sublattice symmetry breaking of the lowest-order Landau level wavefunction, a distinctive feature of synthetic magnetic fields. Our realization implements helical edge states in the gap between n=0 and n=1 Landau levels, experimentally demonstrating a novel way of engineering propagating edge states in photonic lattices. In light of recent advances in the enhancement of polariton-polariton nonlinearities, the Landau levels reported here are promising for the study of the interplay between pseudomagnetism and interactions in a photonic system. Photonics: A magnetic playground for photons A honeycomb structured lattice composed of semiconductor micropillars carefully built up layer by layer can be used to make light mimic an exotic electronic behaviour known as the quantum Hall effect. An international team of researchers led by Omar Jamadi and Alberto Amo at the University of Lille in France developed the procedure, which allows photons to behave as if responding to magnetic fields, to which they are generally insensitive. The photons were induced to occupy quantized energy states known as Landau levels, in addition to adopting unusual topological arrangements. This opens what the researchers describe as a new playground for manipulating and exploring topological properties of light that had previously been inaccessible for study. Modifying the properties of the semiconductor micropillars could offer the possibility of studying photon nonlinearities in the honeycomb lattice.

ABSTRACT: In this paper we present PolarFly, a diameter-2 network topology based on the Erd.os-R ' enyi family of polarity graphs from finite geometry. This is the first known diameter-2 topology that asymptotically reaches the Moore bound on the number of nodes for a given network degree and diameter. PolarFly achieves high Moore bound efficiency even for the moderate radixes commonly seen in current and near-future routers, reaching more than 96% of the theoretical peak. It also offers more feasible router degrees than the state-of-the-art solutions, greatly adding to the selection of scalable diameter2 networks. PolarFly enjoys many other topological properties highly relevant in practice, such as a modular design and expandability that allow incremental growth in network size without rewiring the whole network. Our evaluation shows that PolarFly outperforms competitive networks in terms of scalability, cost and performance for various traffic patterns.

ABSTRACT: 2D metal chalcogenide materials have received enormous attention due to their extraordinary bio-chemical, electronic, magnetic, thermal and optical properties. Compared with the typical two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and topological insulators, cuprous sulfide (Cu2S) has very different two-dimensional lattice structures, along with excellent electro-catalysis and high conductivity. However, the nonlinear optical properties of Cu2S have never been studied until now. Here, the nonlinear photonics characteristics of Cu2S and its application in ultrafast lasers have been systematically studied for the first time. Through optical deposition of Cu2S nanosheets on a tapered fiber, the nonlinear optical properties of Cu2S nanosheets are measured through the interaction with the evanescent field. The results indicate that superior nonlinear saturable absorption properties with a modulation depth of 0.51% are achieved. An erbium-doped fiber (EDF) laser is constructed to verify the performance of the Cu2S saturable absorber (SA). The results show that an output pulse with 8.06 MHz repetition rate, 1.04 ps pulse duration, 1530.4 nm central wavelength and 3.1 nm spectral width without an obvious Kelly sideband is obtained. Considering the diversity of the metal chalcogenide family, various engineering applications may be developed from the nonlinear saturable absorption characteristics of Cu2S, including optical fiber communication/sensing, precision optical metrology, material processing and nonlinear optics.

ABSTRACT: "We show how both the ellipticity g and degree of polarization P influence the extraordinary optical chirality properties of nonparaxial vortex beams. We find that, in stark contrast to paraxial optics and nonvortex modes, extremely rich and tunable spatial distributions of optical chirality density can be produced by an optical vortex beam under tight focusing. We develop a theoretical description of how the optical chirality can be tailored for purpose by altering both the state g and degree of polarization P of the input vortex mode, along with the magnitude and sign of optical orbital angular momentum via the pseudoscalar topological charge & POUND . We expect that the results will have a significant role in both producing alternative techniques and improving existing methods in chiral nano-optics and structured light photonics."

ABSTRACT: Magneto-optical effect refers to a rotation of polarization plane, which has been widely studied in traditional ferromagnetic metal and insulator films and scarcely in two-dimensional layered materials. Here, we uncover a new nonreciprocal magnetophonon Raman scattering effect in ferromagnetic few-layer CrI3. We observed a rotation of the polarization plane of inelastically scattered light between -20 degrees and +60 degrees that are tunable by an out-of-plane magnetic field from -2.5 to 2.5 T. It is experimentally observed that the degree of polarization can be magnetically manipulated between -20 and 85%. This work raises a new magneto-optical phenomenon and could create opportunities of applying two-dimensional ferromagnetic materials in Raman lasing, topological photonics, and magneto-optical modulator for information transport and storage.

ABSTRACT: Black phosphorus (BP), a two-dimensional (2D) material, has a direct bandgap that can be tuned by changing the layers and applied strain, which fills the lacuna left by graphene topological insulators and transition-metal dichalcogenides. Theoretically, the direct and tunable bandgap should enable broadband applications for optoelectronics with high efficiencies in the spectral range from the visible to the mid-infrared. Here, a BP broadband optical modulator is experimentally constructed and passively modulated lasers at 639 nm (red), 1.06 mu m (near-infrared), and 2.1 mu m (mid-infrared) are realized by using a BP optical modulator as the saturable absorber in bulk lasers. The obtained results provide a promising alternative for rare broadband optical modulators and broaden the application range of BP in photonics.

ABSTRACT: In this Letter, a method of stacking two opposite-handed cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs) with the same pitches and the same surface azimuthal angles to generate vector beams from homogeneous linear polarization is proposed. By this means, vector beams with arbitrary orders can be generated based on point-to-point photo-alignment technology. In our experiment, radially polarized, azimuthally polarized, and high-order vector beams with high efficiency have been generated. The device operates light polarization within the Bragg reflection polychromatic bandgap. Our proposal also provides the possibility to generate reflective hybrid-order Poincare beams if these two CLC layers are impressed with different topological charges. It has great potential for reflective photonics applications in high-resolution imaging, focusing, and information processing. (C) 2019 Optical Society of America

ABSTRACT: Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians effectively describing the physics of open systems have become an important tool in various physical platforms, such as photonics, mechanical systems, and electric circuits. The study of non-Hermitian states in electric circuits is developing rapidly recently and forming the field of topoelectrical circuits. Here, we report on the theoretical realization of a higher-order exceptional points (EPs) topological circuit induced by gain and loss. It is shown that, by tuning the value of the positive and negative resistors in the circuit, EPs can collide and merge leading to higher-order singularities. We observe the different energy-difference conserving dynamics near the EPs and the enhanced sensitivity at higher-order EPs. Our results show a way to get higher sensitivity in a non-Hermitian electrical circuit.

ABSTRACT: Bi-anisotropic optical metamaterials are playing an increasingly important role in current wave-functional metamaterials and topological photonics due to their extra degree of freedom in addition to the permittivity and permeability. In this work, we derived the closed-form expressions for effective constitutive parameters of 2-dimensional (2D) bi-anisotropic metamaterials whose chirality tensors can possess both diagonal and off-diagonal components in the long-wavelength limit based on the Mie theory. Our formulas can be regarded as an extension of the Maxwell-Garnet formula to 2D bi-anisotriopic metamaterials and are verified through full wave numerical simulations. These closed-form formulas will benefit the design and analysis of the optical properties of 2D bi-anisotriopic metamaterials.

ABSTRACT: We propose how to create and manipulate one-way nonclassical light via photon blockade in rotating nonlinear devices. We refer to this effect as nonreciprocal photon blockade (PB). Specifically, we show that in a spinning Kerr resonator, PB happens when the resonator is driven in one direction but not the other. This occurs because of the Fizeau drag, leading to a full split of the resonance frequencies of the countercirculating modes. Different types of purely quantum correlations, such as single- and two-photon blockades, can emerge in different directions in a well-controlled manner, and the transition from PB to photon-induced tunneling is revealed as well. Our work opens up a new route to achieve quantum nonreciprocal devices, which are crucial elements in chiral quantum technologies or topological photonics.

ABSTRACT: We demonstrate a new approach for dynamically manipulating the optical response of an atomically thin semiconductor, a monolayer of MoSe2, by suspending it over a metallic mirror. First, we show that suspended van der Waals heterostructures incorporating a MoSe2 monolayer host spatially homogeneous, lifetime-broadened excitons. Then, we interface this nearly ideal excitonic system with a metallic mirror and demonstrate control over the exciton-photon coupling. Specifically, by electromechanically changing the distance between the heterostructure and the mirror, thereby changing the local photonic density of states in a controllable and reversible fashion, we show that both the absorption and emission properties of the excitons can be dynamically modulated. This electromechanical control over exciton dynamics in a mechanically flexible, atomically thin semiconductor opens up new avenues in cavity quantum optomechanics, nonlinear quantum optics, and topological photonics.

ABSTRACT: Silicon photonic switch is recognized as a cost-effective optical switching technology because it has many applications in long-haul telecommunication networks, short-reach data center and high-performance computing. In this paper, the research progress of various silicon photonic switch technologies is reviewed systematically. Firstly, the principles of three kinds of switch technologies including Mach-Zehnder interferometer (thermo-optic and carrier-injection types), micro-ring resonator (thermo-optic and carrier-injection types) and micro-electro-mechanical-system actuated waveguide coupler (electrostatic actuated type) are introduced. The switch technologies with the state-of-the-art insertion loss, crosstalk, switch time, footprint and power consumption are summarized and compared. Then the recent demonstrations of large-port silicon photonic matrix based on the above switch technologies are discussed. In this paper, we also investigate the key technologies such as topological architecture, passive components and optoelectronic packaging, which affect the performance of large-port optical switch matrix. Specifically, we study the scalability of various topologies, low-loss/broadband waveguide components, high-density optical/electrical packaging and control interface to improve the overall performance of the silicon photonic switch matrix. Finally, we discuss the critical technical challenges that might hamper the commercialization of silicon photonic switches and envision their future.

ABSTRACT: Generating and tailoring photocurrent in topological materials has immense importance in fundamental studies and technological front. Present work introduces a universal method to generate ultrafast photocurrent in both inversion-symmetric and inversion-broken Weyl semimetals with degenerate Weyl nodes at the Fermi level. Our approach harnesses the asymmetric electronic population in the conduction band induced by an intense single-color circularly polarized laser pulse. It has been found that the induced photocurrent can be tailored by manipulating helicity and ellipticity of the employed laser. Moreover, our approach generates photocurrent in realistic situations when the Weyl nodes are positioned at different energies and have finite tilt along a certain direction. Present work adds a new dimension on practical applications of Weyl semimetals for optoelectronics and photonics-based quantum technologies.

ABSTRACT: The quantum Hall system possesses topologically protected edge states, which have enormous theoretical and practical implications in both fermionic and bosonic systems. Harnessing the quantum Hall effect in optical platforms with lower dimensionality is highly desirable with synthetic dimensions and has attracted broad interests in the photonics society. Here, we introduce an alternative way to realize the artificial magnetic field in a frequency dimension, which is achieved in a pump-probe configuration with cross-phase modulations in a one-dimensional four-waveguide array. The dynamics of the topological chiral edge state has been studied and the influence from the crosstalk of the pump fields has been explored. Our work shows an all-optical way to simulate the quantum Hall system in a photonic system and holds potential applications in manipulating light in waveguide systems.

ABSTRACT: We study theoretically the photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE) in metasurface bilayers with twisted adjacent two-dimensional material layers. When the coupling strength between adjacent twisted metasurfaces is strong, it can be found that the giant PSHE shifts of the reflected and transmitted beams exist at different types of topological transition points. For weakly coupling stre n gth between metasurfaces, the PSHE shifts of reflected and transmitted beams present oscillations due to the Fabry-Perot resonance in metasurface bilayers. PSHE shifts can be manipulated by controlling physical parameters such as the twist angle of metasurface bilayers and the voltage applied to metasurfaces. By combining with the weak measurement method, these phenomena can be expected to provide a promising observation platform for investigating moire physics and twistronics in photonics.

ABSTRACT: Bismuth (Bi), a topological material, where many interesting condensed matter phenomena have been observed, possesses unique physical properties when its thickness is reduced to thin film. Here, we prepared the highly stable, single-crystalline, continuous Bi thin film via the vapor deposition (VD) method and found that the Bi thin film can exhibit broadband, ultrafast nonlinear optical response with low saturable intensity ranging from the near infrared to mid -infrared spectral range under strong excitation. Moreover, we demonstrated that the Bi thin film was favorable to act as a nonlinear pulse modulator toward a high performance pulsed laser operating in optical communication and mid-infrared wavelengths. The experimental results highlight the prospects of Bi thin film as broadband pulsed modulators and may open new avenues toward advanced Bi-based broadband photonic devices.

ABSTRACT: Optical vortices have drawn extensive research interests due to their widespread applications in various fields. Therefore, it is of great significance to modulate optical vortices to endow them with more properties. Herein, the autofocusing and self-healing properties are introduced to optical vortices via implementing circular cubic phase modulation. The propagation dynamics of the modulated optical vortex is analyzed, and the experimental results match well with the simulations. Moreover, the autodefocusing optical vortices can also be generated, and the flexible switching between the autofocusing state and autodefocusing state can be easily realized by adjusting the helicity of the incident circular polarization. Besides, the topological charges of the two states are also experimentally verified. Our study provides a novel way to modulate optical vortices, which may enrich their applications in optics and photonics.

ABSTRACT: In the last decade, silicon photonic switches are increasingly believed to be potential candidates for replacing the electrical switches in the applications of telecommunication networks, data center and high-throughput computing, due to their low power consumption (Picojoules per bit), large bandwidth (Terabits per second) and high-level integration (Square millimeters per port). This review paper focuses on the state of the art and our perspectives on silicon photonic switching technologies. It starts with a review of three types of fundamental switch engines, i.e., Mach-Zehnder interferometer, micro-ring resonator and micro-electro-mechanical-system actuated waveguide coupler. The working mechanisms are introduced and the key specifications such as insertion loss, crosstalk, switching time, footprint and power consumption are evaluated. Then it is followed by the discussion on the prototype of large-scale silicon photonic fabrics, which are based on the configuration of above-mentioned switch engines. In addition, the key technologies, such as topological architecture, passive components and optoelectronic packaging, to improve the overall performance are summarized. Finally, the critical challenges that might hamper the silicon photonic switching technologies transferring from proof-of-concept in lab to commercialization are also discussed.

ABSTRACT: Based on an efficient and bottom-up synthesis technique, Bismuth Selenide (Bi2Se3) nanoplatelets with uniform morphology and average thickness down to 3-7 nm had been fabricated. Its nonlinear absorption property under high power excitation had been well characterized by our Z-scan measurement system at different illumination wavelengths, and we found that the as-fabricated bi-layer Bi2Se3 nanoplatelets show unique nonlinear optical responses, that is, with a saturable optical intensity of 32 GW/cm(2) (resp. 3.7 MW/cm(2)) and a modulation depth of 88% (resp. 36%) at 800 nm (resp. 1565 nm). By implementing its saturable absorption property, we designed an optical saturable absorber device based on bilayer Bi2Se3 nanoplatelets through deposited them onto the end-facet of optical fiber. The as fabricated optical saturable absorber device allows for the generation of mode-locking pulses at 1571 nm with pulse duration of 579 fs and a repetition rate of 12.54 MHz at a pump power of 160 mW. The method on fabricating ultrathin Bi2Se3 nanoplatelets may pave a new way to massive production of large-area topological insulator thin films that can be used in two-dimensional layered materials related photonics device.

ABSTRACT: Titanium trisulfide (TiS3) is regarded as a candidate material for optoelectronic devices and nano-transistors due to its photoresponse. However, its nonlinear optical response in a mode-locked laser is yet to be investigated. Here, the performance of TiS3 as a saturable absorber in a mode-locked laser is demonstrated. The generated mode-locked pulses achieve pulse duration as short as 147.72 fs at 1555nm, which indicates that TiS3 as a potential functional material has applications in nanomaterial-related photonics.

ABSTRACT: "Useful in the enhancement of light-matter interaction, localization of light is at the heart of photonics studies. Different approaches have been proposed to localize light, including those based on dynamical localization, topological trivial or nontrivial defects in the band gap of photonic crystals, and bound states in the continuum. Recent studies on the non-Hermitian skin effect have provided us new means to localize waves. Inspired by two recent studies [Li et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 223903 (2022)  Zhu and Gong, Phys. Rev. B 106, 035425 (2022)], we propose an innovative method towards localized light in continuous systems via photonic corner skin modes, which are hybrid skin-topological modes as a special kind of second-order non-Hermitian skin effect with symmetrically distributed gain and loss. Specifically, we propose to make use of weak pseudoinversion symmetric gain and loss, which does not close the band gap of the system, to realize a non-Hermitian photonic Chern insulator with chiral edge states. The chiral edge states then accumulate at certain corners of the system. Intriguing phenomena such as corner skin modes arising from an underlying bipolar second-order non-Hermitian skin effect and multiple-corner skin modes are predicted in continuous systems."

ABSTRACT: Structurally, silica (SiO2,) is a particularly interesting oxide due to the ease with which its inherent flexibility can be exploited. This topological richness has given rise to numerous nanostructured materials (e.g. mesoporous materials, nanoscale thin films) with applications in catalysis, adsorbents, and micro-electronics. Recently, individual silica nanostructures with dimensions of the order of a single nanometre have been also controllably fabricated in a variety of distinct topological forms (e.g. nanopores, nanospheres, nanotubes) with new potential in areas such as photonics, drug-delivery. Although technically impressive, almost all such silica nanostructures are produced by the chemical/physical manipulation of random molecular networks of amorphous silica possessing defect-rich surfaces. Such inherent disorder presents inherent limitations to further miniaturisation and control for nanotechnological applications increasingly requiring atomic precision e.g. molecular electronics. Extending on previous work showing that defect-containing silica chains may be energetically/reactively stabilised as fully coordinated molecular rings, herein we explore a range of atomically well-ordered fully coordinated (SiO2)(12) clusters, via density functional theory (DFT) and classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in order to assess their potential viability as building blocks for novel cluster-based silica materials.

ABSTRACT: As a unique two-dimensional material, few-layered black phosphorus (BP) nanosheets have shown promising applications in electronics and optoelectronics. Black phosphorus quantum dots (BPQDs) have attracted attention due to the unique properties of BP combined with the edge effects. In this paper, we report on the all-optical application of BPQD based on its nonlinear Kerr effect. BPQDs were synthesized using a liquid exfoliation method combined with probe sonication and bath sonication. BPQD deposited on the microfiber as an optical device was demonstrated as the Kerr switcher with extinction ratio of 20 dB and four-wave mixing based wavelength converter with -40 dB conversion efficiency. These findings suggest that BPQD-based novel nonlinear photonics devices could be further developed in the applications of next generation high-speed optical communication.

ABSTRACT: Conventional Kelly sidebands soliton and dip-type sidebands soliton were observed with the employment of Bi2Te3 as saturable absorber (SA) in Erbium-Doped Fiber Laser (EDFL). The fabricated Bi2Te3 possessed the following characteristics: I-sat 102 MW/cm(2), modulation depth 41.4%, and non-saturable absorption at 10%. The Bi(2)Te3 solution was transferred to the end of the fiber ferrule by the optical deposition method. Conventional Kelly sidebands soliton was obtained with a fundamental repetition rate and pulse width of 24 MHz and 0.78 ps, respectively. The existing cavity length was extended and with the appropriate tuning of light polarization, dip peak intensity soliton sidebands with bunched pulses were observed. The oscillation trace revealed the repetition rate of dip-peak intensity sidebands soliton was ascertained at 13.5 MHz, which was in accordance with the cavity length. There was a total of 144 pulses in a single bunch envelope under the maximum available pump power. With the appropriate tuning of light polarization, constructive and destructive interference between soliton and dispersive waves took place in EDFL resulting in the formation of peak intensity (Kelly sidebands) and dip-peak intensity on the soliton spectrum. To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first demonstration of dip-peak intensity sidebands soliton using Bi2Te3.

ABSTRACT: "A multipoint interferometer (MI), uniformly distributed point-like pinholes in a circle, was proposed to measure the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of vortex beams [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 100801 (2008)], which can be used for measuring OAM of light from astronomical sources. This is a simple and robust method: however, it is noted that this method is only available for low topological charge because the diffracted intensity patterns for vortex beams with higher OAM will repeat periodically. Here, we propose an improved multipoint interferometer (IMI) for measuring the OAM of an optical vortex with high topological charge. The structure of our IMI is almost the same as the MI, but the size of each pinhole is larger than a point in the ML Such a small change enables each pinhole to get more phase information from the incident beams: accordingly, the IMI can distinguish any vortex beams with different OAM. We demonstrate its viability both theoretically and experimentally. (C) 2020 Chinese Laser Press"

ABSTRACT: Topological photonics have led to robust optical behavior of optical devices, which has alleviated the influence of manufacturing defects and perturbations on the device performance. Meanwhile, temporal coupled-mode theory (t-CMT) has been developed and applied widely. However, the t-CMT of cascaded coupled cavities (CCC) system and its corresponding high-order filter has yet to be established. Here, the t-CMT of CCC system is established based on the existing t-CMT. By combining the CCC with topological waveguides, a versatile design scheme of high-order nonreciprocal add-drop filter (HONAF) is proposed. The relationship between the coupling effect of cavities and transmission and the filtering performance of HONAF is analyzed quantitatively. Then, a method to improve the transmission efficiency and quality factor of the filter is given. The proposed HONAF is based on the combination of gyromagnetic photonic crystals and decagonal Penrose-type photonic quasicrystals. The transmission and filtering performance of the HONAF are numerically analyzed, which verifies the consistency between theoretical prediction and numerical simulation. The established t-CMT of CCC system can be widely used in coupled resonator optical waveguides and their related systems. The proposed HONAF with excellent performance can also be applied to wavelength division multiplexing/demultiplexing systems.

ABSTRACT: New applications of template-generated structures and surfaces are foreseen in microelectronic joining, photonics, and analytical chemistry. They require a special tuning of morphological and topological parameters. High-resolution imaging techniques allow for optimising surface properties and grain size of metal-rod decorated surfaces. Submicron wires and more complex lawn-structures with diameters of 600 - 50 nm have been produced by galvanic deposition at porous polymer templates. Their application for low-temperature interconnect formation is under evaluation. First results indicate that single-metal and layered nano-lawn can be attractive for microsystem technology in general, but also in analytical chemistry and related fields. Template techniques are discussed and experimental approaches to use gold nano-lawn are presented The development of new materials and appropriate techniques will be useful for future packaging technologies of (micro-)electronics to come.

ABSTRACT: The impact of imbalance in waveguide propagation constants among parity-time symmetric coupled waveguides and/or of a complex-valued coupling coefficient is assessed. The narrow tolerance found implies that attempts to tightly control waveguide parameters appear to be elusive because of fabrication technology limitations, calling for more feasible mitigation avenues. It is shown that a grating-assisted parity-time symmetric coupler design restores both technologically robust binary switching operations and exceptional points. In addition, the proposed design is compatible with birefringence compensation techniques, providing polarization-independent operation as well as coupling and/or gain-loss profile modulation techniques that extend the control of switching operation in the parity-time symmetric phase. Using the wavelength as an additional tuning parameter near exceptional points opens promising avenues for manipulating the trajectory on Riemann sheets in topological photonics applications.

ABSTRACT: We present the experimental generation and analysis of both the intensity and phase of an optical vortex beam originating from a superposition of Airy-vortex beams. A new theoretical proposal is accessible to generate an array of Airy-vortex beams from a superposition of N identical Airy beams symmetrically located along the propagation axis, where each beam is superimposed with an optical vortex and are characterized by the same topological charge 1. Additionally, a single experimental apparatus enables both the optical generation and reconstruction of computer-generated holograms implemented on a spatial light modulator and its phase analysis by digital holography. The experimental results agreed with the theoretical predictions. The array of Airy-vortex beams has potential applications for trapping and rotating micro-particles in optical tweezers, modulation in optics communications, optical metrology, and others in optics and photonics.

ABSTRACT: We investigate the magnetic dipole spontaneous emission in the periodic all-dielectric subwavelength spheres array by the magnetic dyadic Green function, together with Cartesian multipole decomposition approach. We find that magnetic Purcell factor exhibits energies splitting (forming quasi-normal modes) due to strong coupling effect between different part of all-dielectric optical antennas. The period plays an important role in the magnetic Purcell effect, and there is an optimized period for the optical antenna to maximize the magnetic Purcell factor. In addition, the magnetic dipole along the spheres' dimer axis will significantly couple to the higher order multipolar Mie resonances with magnetic Purcell factor greater than 400. Our work will help to design all-dielectric nanoantennas to manipulate magnetic light emission originating from magnetic-dipole transitions and study the magnetic light-matter interactions in topological photonics.

ABSTRACT: We report the realization of tunable spin-dependent splitting in intrinsic photonic spin Hall effect. By breaking the rotational symmetry of a cylindrical vector beam, the intrinsic vortex phases that the two spin components of the vector beam carries, which is similar to the geometric Pancharatnam-Berry phase, are no longer continuous in the azimuthal direction, and leads to observation of spin accumulation at the opposite edge of the beam. Due to the inherent nature of the phase and independency of light-matter interaction, the observed photonic spin Hall effect is intrinsic. Modulating the topological charge of the vector beam, the spin-dependent splitting can be enhanced and the direction of spin accumulation is switchable. Our findings may provide a possible route for generation and manipulation of spin-polarized photons, and enables spin-based photonics applications. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

ABSTRACT: The large bandwidth and high intensity of ultrafast vortex pulses, i.e. pulses with orbital angular momentum (OAM), open new prospects for applications in communication, imaging or nonlinear photonics. In previous experiments, we demonstrated the peculiar spatio-spectral behavior of pulsed polychromatic vortex beams in the vicinity of phase singularities. It was shown that the rotation of characteristic, so-called spectral eyes and the spectral dependent Gouy phase are closely connected. For practical applications, a controlled variation of spatio-spectral distributions is required. Here we report on our most recent studies concerning the dependence of time- integrated spectral maps on key optical parameters. It is shown that the speed of rotation of spectral eyes during the propagation is essentially determined by the angular and spectral profiles. This enables to modify the spectral rotation characteristics by applying low-dispersion, adaptive optical components. The performance of reflective liquid-crystal-on silicon spatial light modulators (LCoS-SLMs) is compared to diffractive spiral gratings with variable illumination. Moreover, the generation of wavepackets with a time-dependent orbital angular momentum (self-torque) by superimposing multiple tailored vortex pulses is proposed. This allows for extending the capabilities vortex pulses by defined non-stationary spatio-spectral and topological characteristics.

ABSTRACT: A kind of optical beam with controllable rotating intensity blades is generated by coaxially superposing two optical vortex beams with frequency difference (Delta omega), different topological charges (m(1) and m(2)) and equal amplitude. It is shown theoretically that the number of the blades is determined by the subtraction of topological charges (m(1) - m(2)) and the angular velocity of the rotating pattern is equal to Delta omega/(m(1) - m(2)). In our experiment, the rotating beams were generated by two optical vortex beams with opposite topological charges, where the frequency difference is acquired by a rotating plate glass. The results are quite in accordance with the simulations. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Spin-orbit coupling of electromagnetic waves is one of the most important effects in topological photonics, but so far it has not been studied in photonic graphene implementations based on paraxial configuration, in particular, in atomic vapor cells. We generate experimentally a honeycomb refractive index pattern in such a cell using electromagnetically induced transparency. We demonstrate that an effective spin-orbit coupling appears as a correction to the paraxial beam equations because of the strong spatial gradients of the permittivity. It leads to the coupling of spin and angular momentum at the Dirac points of the graphene lattice. Our results suggest that the polarization degree of freedom plays an important role in many configurations where it has been previously neglected.

ABSTRACT: Virtual perfect absorption is the effect in which the reflection from a reactive loss-less load is canceled due to appropriate shaping of the impinging signal or time-modulation of the load, resulting in transfer of the signal to the load in the form of stored energy. As a result, the load appears lossy, although it does not contain any lossy elements. Here, we present a simple circuit based on a time-modulated inductor and capacitor that exhibits a real effective impedance, either positive or negative, thereby providing virtual loss or gain. We also show how the same circuit can also realize time-varying positive/negative effective impedances. Quite importantly, the required modulation is adiabatic, making it easier to realize than other approaches. We expect that these results will be useful in the design of parity-time symmetric systems and photonics topological insulators.

ABSTRACT: In this article, we design a low-loss, high-bandwidth Z-bend photonic silicon crystal waveguide bending in a triangular lattice through topology optimization. Based on the topological optimization method, we change the relative position of air holes in the global scope to maximize the transmittance and bandwidth of the waveguide. The simulation results indicate that the transmission characteristics can be effectively improved with our method. After the optimization, the loss of the waveguide can be reduced to -5 dB and the bandwidth can increase to 160 nm. Our research has great significance for further optimizing the propagation of light in photonic crystals.

ABSTRACT: The emergence of phosphorene has generated significant interest in 2D group VA nanomaterials. Among this group, bismuthene exhibits layer-dependent direct bandgaps, high carrier mobility, and topological insulator properties because of its unique structure and ultrathin nature, distinguishing it as a promising candidate for photonic applications. Particularly, its outstanding stability in air makes bismuthene more advantageous than phosphorene for practical applications. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of recent advances regarding 2D bismuth by focusing on the aspects of methods of synthesis and photonic applications. First, the structure and fundamental properties of bismuthene are described, referring to its crystallinity and band structures, as well as to its nonlinear optical properties. Subsequently, the common synthesis methods for 2D bismuth are summarized, including both top-down and bottom-up approaches. Then, potential photonic applications based on 2D bismuth, involving nonlinear photonic devices, photocatalyst, and photodetectors, are illustrated. The performance, mechanisms, and features of the devices are discussed. Finally, the review is summarized and some challenges and future outlooks in this field are addressed.

ABSTRACT: The activity in the research on novel optical materials exhibiting nonlinear optical (NLO) properties is surveyed, especially nonlinear absorption, that may be attractive for various applications, including those in optoelectronics, photonics, and biophotonics. The recently introduced concept of NLO pigments-insoluble colored materials that can exhibit useful NLO effects-is demonstrated to apply to the multifunctional group of coordination polymers (CPs) and their subgroup of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which may be applied in their microcrystalline form or as nanoparticles. Nanocrystalline materials such as semiconductor quantum dots or plasmonic particles made of noble metals have been widely studied and their properties have been often reviewed, thus they are not included in this review. On the other hand, studies performed on perovskites are described: materials that appear to have great potential for NLO applications in addition to their well-known merit in photovoltaics. There is also much activity in the field of low-dimensional, especially 2D structures of various kinds, and this review covers many examples of such structures, not including the broad topic of carbon nanostructures (graphene, nanotubes etc.) but concentrating on other emerging nonlinear optical materials such as black phosphorus, transition metal dichalcogenides, MXenes, and topological insulators.

ABSTRACT: The Richards-Wolf formulas not only adequately describe a light field at a tight focus, but also make it possible to describe a light field immediately behind an ideal spherical lens, that is, on a converging spherical wave front. Knowing all projections of light field strength vectors behind the lens, the longitudinal components of spin and orbital angular momenta (SAM and OAM) can be found. In this case, the longitudinal projection of the SAM immediately behind the lens either remains zero or decreases. This means that the Spin-Orbital Conversion (SOC) effect where part of the spin goes into orbit takes place immediately behind the lens. And the sum of longitudinal projections of SAM and OAM is preserved. As for the spin Hall effect, it does not form right behind the lens, but appears as focusing occurs. That is, there is no Hall effect immediately behind the lens, but it is maximum at the focus. This happens because two optical vortices with topological charges (TCs) 2 and -2 and with spins of different signs (with left and right circular polarization) are formed right behind the lens. However, the total spin is zero since amplitudes of these vortices are the same. The amplitude of optical vortices becomes different while focusing and at the focus itself, and therefore regions with spins of different signs (Hall effect) appear. A general form of initial light fields which longitudinal field component is zero at the focus was found. In this case, the SAM vector can only have a longitudinal component that is nonzero. The SAM vector elongated only along the optical axis at the focus is used in magnetization task.

The chemically different precursor clusters 0@8(Na2In6) and 0@K2In6 in the form of hexagonal bipyramids are established. The centers of Na2In6 clusters occupy positions 1a with a symmetry of 6/mmm. The centers of the K2In6-A and K2In6-B clusters occupy positions 2c with symmetry -6m2, and 3g positions with mmm symmetry. The Na2In6 clusters are the templates on the surface of which atomic shells of 36 atoms are formed. The composition of the two-layer cluster is K44 = 0@8(Na2In6)@36(In6Cd6K6)(2). Layer formation occurs upon the K44 clusters binding to the K2Cd6-A clusters. The symmetry and topological code of the self-assembly of the 3D structures from the K44 suprapolyhedral precursors with the participation of the K2Cd6 polyhedral clusters, as well as Na and K spacer atoms, are reconstructed.

ABSTRACT: Optical vortex beams with orbital angular momentum (OAM) have recently received considerable attention in high-speed optical communication due to their spatial orthogonality. For realizing undamaged demultiplexing, an all-dielectric multiplexed metasurface for demultiplexing wavelength-division multiplexing and polarization-division multiplexing OAM light was proposed. This OAM demultiplexer works in the near-infrared spectral region and the transmitted vortex beams carry original topological charges and phase distribution. It is worth mentioning that this demultiplexer is vastly different from previous demultiplexers, in that it not only eliminates the cumbersome process of converting vortex beams into Gaussian beams but also maintains the original property of the transmitted vortex beams. The presented demultiplexer has flexible and compact features, which are suitable for OAM communication systems. Also, the designed wavelength-and polarization-multiplexed metasurface expands the scope of metasurface compactness multifunctional photonics, which has applications in information security and anti-counterfeiting.

ABSTRACT: Classical bosonic systems may be tailored to support topological order and unidirectional edge transport exploiting gauge fields. Here, we theoretically explore how synthetic gauge fields may be used to induce higher-order topological phases and zero-energy boundary states. We demonstrate these principles in two types of three-dimensional topolectrical circuits with synthetic gauge fields threading through their reduced two-dimensional lattices, leading to a half-quantized quadrupole charge within a region of the momentum space. We theoretically show the emergence of nodal line rings and Weyl points in the bulk dispersion, whose projected surfaces and hinges support surface Fermi arcs and flat hinge Fermi arcs emanating from the nodal line ring and Weyl points, representing the spectral signature of higher-order topological semimetals. These analogs of higher-order semimetals realized in electric circuits using synthetic gauge fields may be extended to various photonic platforms and find applications in photonic crystals, nano-optics, and cold atom research.

ABSTRACT: Non-Hermiticity is revolutionizing the common understanding in the Hermitian scope by interfacing with topological physics. A single non-Hermitian band can host nontrivial topology that is defined over the nonzero windings of the system's eigenvalues, but not the eigenvectors, as opposed to the Hermitian topological systems. This unique non-Hermitian band topology is responsible for the intriguing non-Hermitian skin effect. Here, we show that the band topology of non-Hermitian one-band models can experience multiple phase transitions. Each transition is identified by a change of the eigenvalue winding. Such an interesting phenomenon is enabled by strategically manipulating the long-range couplings. Associated with the multiple phase transitions, the non-Hermitian skin effect exhibits anomalous behaviors, i.e., in different phases, the skin modes take on different forms of wave localizations. At the transition points, the skin modes evolve into Bloch-wavelike extended states, as if the Hermiticity is restored. For demonstration, we consider a modified Hatano-Nelson model with nonrecip-rocal next-nearest neighbor couplings. Therein, two phase transitions are identified, corresponding to a stationary and a dynamic one (with respect to the reciprocal nearest-neighbor coupling). Exact analytical derivations are performed to analyze the phase transitions and the associated anomalous non-Hermitian skin effect, which show consistency with the numerical results based on the generalized Brillouin zone method. Our work reveals rich non-Hermitian topological physics in one-band systems, which are considered to be topologically trivial in Hermitian systems. By further showing the anomalous non-Hermitian skin effect, intriguing wave manipulations may inspire experiments in classical realms such as photonics and phononics where versatile non-Hermitian controls are feasible.

ABSTRACT: Adiabatic techniques have much potential to realize practical and robust optical waveguide devices. Traditionally, photonic elements are limited to coupling schemes that rely on proximity to nearest neighbour elements. We combine adiabatic passage with a continuum based long-range optical bus to break free from such topological restraints and thereby outline a new approach to photonic quantum gate design. We explicitly show designs for adiabatic quantum gates that produce a Hadamard, 50:50 and 1/3:2/3 beam splitter, and non-deterministic controlled NOT gate based on planar thin, shallow ridge waveguides. Our calculations are performed under conditions of one and two-photon inputs.

ABSTRACT: Recent developments in the field of photonic spin Hall effect (SHE) offer new opportunities for advantageous measurement of the optical parameters (refractive index, thickness, etc.) of nanostructures and enable spin-based photonics applications in the future. However, it remains a challenge to develop a tunable photonic SHE with any desired spin-dependent splitting for generation and manipulation of spin-polarized photons. Here, we demonstrate experimentally a scheme to realize the photonic SHE tunably by tailoring the space-variant Pancharatnam-Berry phase (PBP). It is shown that light beams whose polarization with a tunable spatial inhomogeneity can contribute to steering the space-variant PBP which creates a spin-dependent geometric phase gradient, thereby possibly realizing a tunable photonic SHE with any desired spin-dependent splitting. Our scheme provides a convenient method to manipulate the spin photon. The results can be extrapolated to other physical system with similar topological origins.

ABSTRACT: Orbital angular momentum of light is a core feature in photonics. Its confinement to surfaces using plasmonics has unlocked many phenomena and potential applications. Here, we introduce the reflection from structural boundaries as a new degree of freedom to generate and control plasmonic orbital angular momentum. We experimentally demonstrate plasmonic vortex cavities, generating a succession of vortex pulses with increasing topological charge as a function of time. We track the spatiotemporal dynamics of these angularly decelerating plasmon pulse train within the cavities for over 300 femtoseconds using time-resolved photoemission electron microscopy, showing that the angular momentum grows by multiples of the chiral order of the cavity. The introduction of this degree of freedom to tame orbital angular momentum delivered by plasmonic vortices could miniaturize pump probe-like quantum initialization schemes, increase the torque exerted by plasmonic tweezers, and potentially achieve vortex lattice cavities with dynamically evolving topology.

ABSTRACT: The spin Hall effect (SHE) of light, as an analogue of the SHE in electronic systems, is a promising candidate for investigating the SHE in semiconductor spintronics/valleytronics, high-energy physics and condensed matter physics, owing to their similar topological nature in the spin-orbit interaction. The SHE of light exhibits unique potential for exploring the physical properties of nanostructures, such as determining the optical thickness, and the material properties of metallic and magnetic thin films and even atomically thin two-dimensional materials. More importantly, it opens a possible pathway for controlling the spin states of photons and developing next-generation photonic spin Hall devices as a fundamental constituent of the emerging spinoptics. In this review, based on the viewpoint of the geometric phase gradient, we give a detailed presentation of the recent advances in the SHE of light and its applications in precision metrology and future spin-based photonics.

ABSTRACT: Non-Hermitian singularities are ubiquitous in non-conservative open systems. Owing to their peculiar topology, they can remotely induce observable effects when encircled by closed trajectories in the parameter space. To date, a general formalism for describing this process beyond simple cases is still lacking. Here we develop a general approach for treating this problem by utilizing the power of permutation operators and representation theory. This in turn allows us to reveal a surprising result that has so far escaped attention: loops that enclose the same singularities in the parameter space starting from the same point and traveling in the same direction, do not necessarily share the same end outcome. Interestingly, we find that this equivalence can be formally established only by invoking the topological notion of homotopy. Our findings are general with far reaching implications in various fields ranging from photonics and atomic physics to microwaves and acoustics.

ABSTRACT: Complex nematic fluids have the remarkable capability for self-assembling regular colloidal structures of various symmetries and dimensionality according to their micromolecular orientational order. Colloidal chains, clusters, and crystals were demonstrated recently, exhibiting soft-matter functionalities of robust binding, spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, entanglement, shape-driven and topological driven assembly, and even memory imprinting. However, no quasicrystalline structures were found. Here, we show with numerical modeling that quasicrystalline colloidal lattices can be achieved in the form of original Penrose P1 tiling by using pentagonal colloidal platelets in layers of nematic liquid crystals. The tilings are energetically stabilized with binding energies up to 2500 k(B)T for micrometer-sized platelets and further allow for hierarchical substitution tiling, i.e., hierarchical pentagulation. Quasicrystalline structures are constructed bottom-up by assembling the boat, rhombus, and star maximum density clusters, thus avoiding other (nonquasicrystalline) stable or metastable configurations of platelets. Central to our design of the quasicrystalline tilings is the symmetry breaking imposed by the platelet shape and the surface anchoring conditions at the colloidal platelets, which are misaligning and asymmetric over two perpendicular mirror planes. Finally, the design of the quasicrystalline tilings as platelets in nematic liquid crystals is inherently capable of a continuous variety of length scales of the tiling, ranging over three orders of magnitude in the typical length (from similar to 10 nm to similar to 10 mu m), which could allow for the design of quasicrystalline photonics at multiple frequency ranges.

ABSTRACT: The emerging Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm paves the way for flexible and automatized management at each layer. The SDN-enabled optical network requires each network element's software abstraction to enable complete control by the centralized network controller. Nowadays, silicon photonics due to its low energy consumption, low latency, and small footprint is a promising technology for implementing photonic switching topologies, enabling transparent lightpath routing in re-configurable add-drop multiplexers. To this aim, a model for the complete management of photonic switching systems' control states is fundamental for network control. Typically, photonics-based switches are structured by exploiting the modern technology of Photonic Integrated Circuit (PIC) that enables complex elementary cell structures to be driven individually. Thus PIC switches' control states are combinations of a large set of elementary controls, and their definition is a challenging task. In this scenario, we propose the use of several data-driven techniques based on Machine Learning (ML) to model the control states of a PIC NxN photonic switch in a completely blind manner. The proposed ML-based techniques are trained and tested in a completely topological and technological agnostic way, and we envision their application in a real-time control plane. The proposed techniques' scalability and accuracy are validated by considering three different switching topologies: the Honey-Comb Rearrangeable Optical Switch (HCROS), Spanke-Benes, and the Benes network. Excellent results in terms of predicting the control states are achieved for all of the considered topologies.

ABSTRACT: Recent developments in computational inverse design offer the promise of significantly reducing the footprint and allowing complex optical functionality in silicon photonic components as compared to existing conventional building blocks. However, reliable fabrication of such components is one of the major bottlenecks in its widespread adoption. A common characteristic of such designs is the presence of small features that have meaningful impact on the optical performance. Current approaches to tackle this problem consider designing for robustness, such as by co-optimizing for over- and under-etched geometries at the design stage. This is often followed with a design-for-manufacturing optimization step to meet specifications of a foundry such as minimum feature size and curvature radii. Those approaches often incur additional significant computational costs as well as a reduction in peak optical performance. In this work, we highlight our recent progress to bridge the gap between inverse design methods and their ability to deliver reliable and manufacturable designs. We observe that the so-called parameterized shape optimization methods are more likely to produce robust designs for certain classes of components, as showcased in integrated mode converter designs. For components that benefit from topological inverse design such as wavelength de-multiplexers, we propose a new optimization penalty that naturally leads the optimizer towards more robust designs. In a new research direction, we also consider improving fabrication reliability by the development and use of data-driven predictive models for fabrication. Leveraging deep learning tools, we present prediction and correction models that improve fabrication outcomes for a variety of components made at an e-beam prototyping foundry.

ABSTRACT: "Optical spin angular momenta in a confined electromagnetic field exhibit a remarkable difference with their free space counterparts: in particular, the optical transverse spin that is locked with the energy propagating direction lays the foundation for many intriguing physical effects such as unidirectional transportation, quantum spin Hall effects, photonic Skyrmions,etc. In order to investigate the underlying physics behind the spin-orbit interactions as well as to develop the optical spin-based applications, it is crucial to uncover the spin texture in a confined field, yet it faces challenges due to their chiral and near-field vectorial features. Here, we propose a scanning imaging technique which can map the near-field distributions of the optical spin angular momenta with an achiral dielectric nanosphere. The spin angular momentum component normal to the interface can be uncovered experimentally by employing the proposed scanning imaging technique and the three-dimensional spin vector can be reconstructed theoretically with the experimental results. The experiment is demonstrated on the example of surface plasmon polaritons excited with various vector vortex beams under a tight-focusing configuration, where the spin-orbit interaction emerges clearly. The proposed method, which can be utilized to reconstruct the photonic Skyrmion and other photonic topological structures, is straightforward and of high precision, and hence it is expected to be valuable for the study of near-field spin optics and topological photonics."

ABSTRACT: The semiclassical evolution of spinning particles has recently been re-examined in condensed matter physics, high-energy physics, and optics, resulting in the prediction of the intrinsic spin Hall effect associated with the Berry phase. A fundamental origin of this effect is related to the spin-orbit interaction and topological monopoles. Here, we report a unified theory and a direct observation of two mutual phenomena: a spin-dependent deflection (the spin Hall effect) of photons and the precession of the Stokes vector along the coiled ray trajectory of classical geometrical optics. Our measurements are in perfect agreement with theoretical predictions, thereby verifying the dynamical action of the topological Berry-phase monopole in the evolution of light. These results may have promising applications in nano-optics and can be immediately extrapolated to the evolution of massless particles in a variety of physical systems.

ABSTRACT: In the area of non-Hermitian physics, there has been increasing research interest in photonics. Recently, this interest has expanded to topological systems in which symmetry and topology intertwine with non-Hermiticity, giving rise to many intriguing physical effects. One of the major tasks in exploring topological systems is unveiling the bulk-boundary correspondence in the presence of non-Hermiticity. Several proposals have been put forward in this vein, including non-Bloch bulk-boundary correspondence and the non-Hermitian skin effect. However, its practical realization has remained elusive thus far. In this paper, we demonstrate a feasible design of a one-dimensional non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model based on photonic coupled resonant optical waveguides (CROWs). We show that non-Hermitian asymmetric coupling can be realized by the judicious design of optical gain and loss elements into unidirectional coupling link rings. The phase transition points of a technically achievable CROW open chain are different from those of the periodic boundary, thus revealing the non-Bloch bulk-boundary correspondence. Moreover, the field distribution is found to be exponentially localized at the ends of an open-boundary chain, which demonstrates the non-Hermitian skin effect. Our results underpin the fundamental importance as well as potential applications in various optical devices such as optical couplers, beam splitters, lasers, optical trapping, etc.

ABSTRACT: Polariton is a quasiparticle generated from strong interaction between a photon and an electric or magneticdipole-carrying excitation. These polaritons can confine light into a small space that is beyond the diffractionlimit of light, thus have greatly advanced the development of nano photonics, nonlinear optics, quantum opticsand other related research. Van der Waals two-dimensional (2D) crystals provide an ideal platform for studyingnano-polaritons due to reduced material dimensionality. In particular, stacking and twisting offer additionaldegree of freedom for manipulating polaritons that are not available in a single-layer material. In this paper, wereview the near-field optical characterizations of various structures and polaritonic properties of stacked/twisted2D crystals reported in recent years, including domain structures of stacked few-layer graphene, moiresuperlattice structures of twisted 2D crystals, twisted topological polaritons, and twisted chiral plasmons. Wealso propose several exciting directions for future study of polaritons in stacked/twisted 2D crystals

ABSTRACT: Spatial light modulators (SLMs) are popular tools for generating structured light fields and have fostered numerous applications in optics and photonics. Here, we explore the limits of what fields these devices are capable of generating and detecting in the context of so-called vortex beams carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM). Our main contributions are to quantify (theoretically and experimentally) how the pixelation of the SLM screen affects the quality of the generated vortex mode and to offer useful heuristics on how to optimise the performance of the displayed digital hologram. In so doing, we successfully generate and detect a very high order optical vortex mode with topological charge l=600

ABSTRACT: A new optical transmission network structure is proposed based on the two-dimensional magneto-optical photonic crystal and topological photonics theory, which is composed of a series of rectangular photonic crystals and air. To create coding units, the three conditions of applying a positive magnetic field, a negative magnetic field, and an air area are marked as +1, -1, and 0, respectively. Then, three types of optical path matrix networks of 2 x 2, 3 x 3, and 4 x 4 are constructed. Finally, COMSOL software package is employed to simulate the transmission path of light waves. The simulation results prove that through different coding sequences, flexible and diverse control of the optical path can be achieved. The proposed control fulfils the requirements of high density optical path transmission and large-capacity information processing in the photonic integrated circuits to emerge in the future.

ABSTRACT: The generation of tightly focused light beams carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) offers new opportunities for applications in photonics, optoelectronics and optical communications. These spatially inhomogeneous light fields render possible the coupling of the photon field to the angular momentum characteristics of the sample. In this study we exploit this fact and consider nanostructured quantum rings (QRs) irradiated by OAM beams with the aim of inducing swiftly local magnetic moments as well as harmonic generation. Based on a time-dependent quantum simulation we investigate different laser setups for efficient magnetic moment generation during and after the pulse application. In particular, we study the role of the winding number of the optical vortex in enhancing the magnetic moment at a fixed laser intensity. Further, we analyze the emitted radiation associated with the photoinduced charge oscillations and the non-equilibrium current circulation. Irreversible relaxation processes due to the interaction of charged carriers with acoustic phonons are included using a density matrix formalism.

ABSTRACT: Nanomaterials are widely used in the fields of sensors, optoelectronics, biophotonics and ultrafast photonics due to their excellent mechanical, thermal, optical, electrical and magnetic properties. Particularly, owing to their nonlinear optical properties, fast response time and broadband operation, nanomaterials are ideal saturable absorption materials in ultrafast photonics, which contribute to the improvement of laser performance. Therefore, nanomaterials are of great importance to applications in wavelength-tunable broadband pulsed lasers.

ABSTRACT: Using computer methods (the ToposPro software package), the combinatorial-topological analysis and modeling of self-assembly of the crystal structure of Li36Ca4Sn24-oS64 (space group (sg) Cmcm, a = 4.640 angstrom, b = 27.112 angstrom, c = 11.491 angstrom, V = 1445.5 angstrom(3)) and LiMgEu2Sn3-oS28 (sg Cmcm, a = 4.782 angstrom, b = 20.717 angstrom, c = 7.743 angstrom, V = 767.1 angstrom(3)). For the Li36Ca4Sn24 intermetallic compound a new type of 11-atom cluster K11 is installed, formed from double pentagonal rings: K11 = 0@11 (Li-5)Ca(Sn-5). The maximum cluster symmetry K11 and primary strand of translationally related K11 clusters corresponds to noncrystallographic symmetry 5m. Primary chains of linked K11 clusters preserving only symmetry m are located in the direction [100] and the distance between the centers of the clusters determines the length of vector a = 4.640 angstrom. The layer is formed when the primary chains located antiparallel are bound. The tetrahedral clusters are located between the primary chains K4 = 0@4 (Li3Sn), forming chains in the direction [100]. The symmetry and topological code of the self-assembly processes of the 3D structure of the LiMgEu intermetallic compound LiMgEu2Sn3-oS28 is reconstructed from clusters K4 = 0@4 (LiMgEuSn) and K3 = 0@3 (Sn2Eu). The layer is formed when the parallel chains of K4 + K3 are bound.

ABSTRACT: Using computer methods (ToposPro software package), a geometric and topological analysis of the crystal structure of the intermetallic Ce80Pd128In284-cF492 (a = 21.838 angstrom, V = 10414.79 angstrom(3), space group F-43m) is carried out. Two new nanocluster precursors with symmetry -43m are found: a two-layer nanocluster K61 composition In@16(Ce4In12)@44(Ce4In12Pd28) with an inner centered Friauf polyhedron In@16(Ce4In12) and with 44 atoms in the outer shell, and a two-layer nanocluster K42 of the composition 0@8(In-8)@34(Ce6Pd4In24) with an inner polyhedron In-8 and with 34 atoms in the outer shell. The symmetry and topological code of the processes of self-assembly of 3D structures from nanoclusters-precursors K61 and K42 is reconstructed in the following form: primary chain -> microlayer -> microframework. In-4-tetrahedra with symmetry -43m, as well as spacer atoms Ce and In, are installed as spacers occupying voids in a 3D framework of nanoclusters K-61 and K-42.

ABSTRACT: The study of topology as it relates to physical systems has rapidly accelerated during the past decade. Critical to the realization of new topological phases is an understanding of the materials that exhibit them and precise control of the materials chemistry. The convergence of new theoretical methods using symmetry indicators to identify topological material candidates and the synthesis of high-quality single crystals plays a key role, warranting discussion and context at an accessible level. This Perspective provides a broad introduction to topological phases, their known properties, and material realizations. We focus on recent work in topological Weyl and Dirac semimetals, with a particular emphasis on magnetic Weyl semimetals and emergent fermions in chiral crystals and their extreme responses to excitations, and we highlight areas where the field can continue to make remarkable discoveries. We further examine open questions and directions for the topological materials science community to pursue, including exploration of non-equilibrium properties of Weyl semimetals and cavity-dressed topological materials. This Perspective provides a broad introduction to topological materials science, with a particular focus on semimetals.

ABSTRACT: The rapid development of quantum information processors has accelerated the demand for technologies that enable quantum networking. One promising approach uses mechanical resonators as an intermediary between microwave and optical fields. Signals from a superconducting, topological, or spin qubit processor can then be converted coherently to optical states at telecom wavelengths. However, current devices built from homogeneous structures suffer from added noise and a small conversion efficiency. Combining advantageous properties of different materials into a heterogeneous design should allow for superior quantum transduction devices-so far these hybrid approaches have however been hampered by complex fabrication procedures. Here we present a novel integration method, based on previous pick-and-place ideas, that can combine independently fabricated device components of different materials into a single device. The method allows for a precision alignment by continuous optical monitoring during the process. Using our method, we assemble a hybrid silicon-lithium niobate device with state-of-the-art wavelength conversion characteristics.

ABSTRACT: Motivated by the close relationship between quantum error-correction, topological order, the holographic AdS/CFT duality, and tensor networks, we initiate the study of approximate quantum error-detecting codes in matrix product states (MPS). We first show that using open-boundary MPS to define boundary to bulk encoding maps yields at most constant distance error-detecting codes. These are degenerate ground spaces of gapped local Hamiltonians. To get around this no-go result, we consider excited states, i.e., we use the excitation ansatz to construct encoding maps: these yield error-detecting codes with distance Omega(n(1-nu)) for any nu is an element of (0, 1) and Omega(log n) encoded qubits. This shows that gapped systems contain - within isolated energy bands - error-detecting codes spanned by momentum eigenstates. We also consider the gapless Heisenberg-XXX model, whose energy eigenstates can be described via Bethe ansatz tensor networks. We show that it contains - within its low-energy eigenspace - an error-detecting code with the same parameter scaling. All these codes detect arbitrary d-local (not necessarily geometrically local) errors even though they are not permutation-invariant. This suggests that a wide range of naturally occurring many-body systems possess intrinsic error-detecting features.

ABSTRACT: Optofluidic lasers are emerging building blocks with immense potential in the development of miniaturized light sources, integrated photonics, and sensors. The capability of on-demand lasing output with programmable and continuous wavelength tunability over a broad spectral range enables key functionalities in wavelength-division multiplexing and manipulation of light-matter interactions. However, the ability to control multicolor lasing characteristics within a small mode volume with high reconfigurability remains challenging. The color gamut is also restricted by the number of dyes and emission wavelength of existing materials. In this study, we introduce a fully programmable multicolor laser by encapsulating organic-dye-doped cholesteric liquid crystal microdroplet lasers in an optofluidic fiber. A mechanism for tuning laser emission wavelengths was proposed by manipulating the topologically induced nanoshell structures in microdroplets with different chiral dopant concentrations. Precision control of distinctive lasing wavelengths and colors covering the entire visible spectra was achieved, including monochromatic lasing, dual-color lasing, tri-color lasing, and white colored lasing with tunable color temperatures. Our findings revealed a CIE color map with 145% more perceptible colors than the standard RGB space, shedding light on the development of programmable lasers, multiplexed encoding, and biomedical detection.

ABSTRACT: The photonic topological insulator has become an important research topic with a wide range of applications. Especially the higher-order topological insulator, which possesses gapped edge states and corner or hinge states in the gap, provides a new scheme for the control of light in a hierarchy of dimensions. In this paper, we propose a heterostructure composed of ordinary-topological-ordinary (OTO) photonic crystal slabs. Two coupled edge states (CESs) are generated due to the coupling between the topological edge states of the ordinary-topological interfaces, which opens up an effective way for high-capacity photonic transport. In addition, we obtain a new band gap between the CESs, and the two kinds of coupled corner states (CCSs) appear in the OTO bend structure. In addition, the topological corner state is also found, which arises from the filling anomaly of a lattice. Compared with the previous topological photonic crystal based on C-4 lattice, CESs, CCSs, and the topological corner state are all directly observed in experiment by using the near-field scanning technique, which makes the manipulation of the electromagnetic wave more flexible. We also verify that the three corner states are all robust to defects. Our work opens up a new way for guiding and trapping the light flow and provides a useful case for the coupling of topological photonic states. (C) 2021 Chinese Laser Press

ABSTRACT: Topological insulators, a new quantum state of matter, have created exciting opportunities for studies in topological quantum physics and for exploring spintronics applications due to their gapless helical metallic surface states. In this study, thin films composed of alternate layers of Bi and Se (Te) ({Bi(3 angstrom)Te(9 angstrom)}(n)/{Bi(3 angstrom)Se(9 angstrom)}(n)) were fabricated by controlling the layer thickness within the atomic scale using thermal evaporation techniques. The high-purity growth of uniform Bi2Se2Te1 thin films has not yet been achieved using a thermal evaporation method. However, as a result of a self-ordering process during annealing, an as-grown amorphous film with p-type polarity could transform into single crystalline Bi2Se2Te1 with n-type polarity. Using THz-time domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) and ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS), we concluded that the conductivity is dominated by the Drude contribution, suggesting the presence of a quantum well state and surface states. Moreover we demonstrated that the emission of terahertz waves from the (001) surface of the single crystalline Bi2Se2Te1 thin film would be possible under the excitation of 790 nm femtosecond optical pulses, indicating the presence of a Dirac-fermion, a photo-Dember effect at the surface state and the transient current within the surface depletion region. The results reported herein provide useful information regarding a valuable deposition method that can be useful in studies of the evolution of surface state electrons in topological insulators.

ABSTRACT: Diabolical points, which originate from parameter-dependent accidental degeneracies of a system's energy levels, have played a fundamental role in the discovery of the Berry phase as well as in photonics (conical refraction), in chemical dynamics, and more recently in novel materials such as graphene, whose electronic band structure possess Dirac points. Here we discuss diabolical points in an optomechanical system formed by multiple scatterers in an optical cavity with periodic boundary conditions. Such configuration is close to experimental setups using micro-toroidal rings with indentations or near-field scatterers. We find that the optomechanical coupling is no longer an analytic function near the diabolical point and demonstrate the topological phase arising through the mechanical motion. Similar to a Fabry-Perot resonator, the optomechanical coupling can grow with the number of scatterers. We also introduce a minimal quantum model of a diabolical point, which establishes a connection to the motion of an arbitrary-spin particle in a 2D parabolic quantum dot with spin-orbit coupling.

ABSTRACT: The past 30 years have witnessed remarkable developments of microcavity exciton-polaritons, which have made a great impact on photonics and optoelectronics from fundamental physics to device applications. New materials and optical structures have been developed for novel polariton lasers for the sake of room temperature operation, flexible mode engineering, and high power efficiency. More powerful spectroscopic techniques have also promoted the understanding of polariton dynamics, coherence, nonlinearity, and topology. In this review, we start with a brief introduction to the picture of polaritons, and various polariton systems based on different microcavity structures and semiconductor materials. Then, we present several important spectroscopic techniques and numerical tools for characterizing polaritons experimentally and theoretically. Next, we address the macroscopic quantum phenomena observed in the polariton systems and review the physics and applications of polariton nonlinearity. Moreover, we highlight the new emerging fields of topological and non-Hermitian polaritons. In the end, we conclude with the future perspectives of microcavity exciton-polaritons.

ABSTRACT: All-optical logic gates (AO-LGs) are the key elements that play a pivotal role in the development of future all-optical networks and all-optical computing. A complete overview of the seven all-optical logic gates (i.e., AND, OR, NOT, XOR, XNOR, NAND, and NOR) based on their design techniques and applications are covered, including the latest technologies, such as topological photonics and artificial intelligence-based designs techniques. In addition, we have further categorized the AO-LGs as reconfigurable gates, simultaneous gates, reversible gates, modulation-based gates, and data rate-based gates. The techniques to implement these different classes of gates are reviewed and their limitations are discussed. We also discuss in brief the various simulation tools used to design and analyze the AO-LGs. Finally, the most feasible techniques for constructing optical integrated circuits based on the existing fabrication technologies and available resources are explored, and future prospects are outlined.

ABSTRACT: In photonics and emerging fields of quantum and topological materials, increasing demands are placed upon the state and control of electromagnetic fields. Dielectric multilayer materials may be designed and optimized to possess extremely sharp spectral and angular photonic resonances allowing for the creation of fields orders of magnitude larger than the exciting field. With enhancements of 10(4) and higher, the extreme nature of these resonances places high constraints on the statistical properties of the physical and optical characteristics of the materials. To what extent the spectral and angular shifts occur as a result of fluctuations in the refractive indices and morphologies of the involved low-loss subdomains have not been considered previously. Here, we present how parameter variations such as those caused by fluctuations in deposition rate, yielding bias, random and compensated errors, may affect the resonance properties of low-loss all-dielectric stacks.

ABSTRACT: Ultrashort pulsed laser is an indispensable tool for the evolution of photonic technology in the present and future. This laser has been progressing tremendously with new pulse regimes and incorporating novel devices inside its cavity. Recently, a nanomaterial based saturable absorber (SA) was used in ultrafast laser that has improved the lasing performance and caused a reduction in the physical dimension when compared to conventional SAs. To date, the nanomaterials that are exploited for the development of SA devices are carbon nanotubes, graphene, topological insulators, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and black phosphorous. These materials have unique advantages such as high nonlinear optical response, fiber compatibility and ease of fabrication. In these, TMDs are prominent and an emerging two-dimensional nanomaterial for photonics and optoelectronics applications. Therefore, we review the reports of Q-switched and mode-locked pulsed lasers using TMDs (specifically MoS2, MoSe2, WS2 and WSe2) based SAs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Two-dimensional (2D) materials have drawn great interest for their applications in mode-locking due to their unique optical nonlinearities. However, most of these 2D materials are semi-conductors. In this study, a new kind of semi-metal indium bismuth (InBi) is reported which is a topological nodal-line semi-metal with exotic physical properties. The InBi nanomaterials were prepared through a liquid phase exfoliation method with an average thickness of 32.8 nm. The saturable absorption property was measured and passive mode-locking operation was successfully achieved in the Er-doped fiber laser. It exhibited a modulation depth of 3.21%, a saturable intensity of 100 MW cm(-2) and a pulse width about 859.97 fs corresponding to the central wavelength of 1562.27 nm and 3 dB bandwidth of 2.98 nm. The experimental results open a new avenue for the use of semi-metals InBi nanomaterials in lasers and photonics applications.

ABSTRACT: In the recently discovered Weyl semimetals, the Fermi surface may feature disjoint, open segments the so-called Fermi arcs-associated with topological states bound to exposed crystal surfaces. Here we show that the collective dynamics of electrons near such surfaces sharply departs from that of a conventional three-dimensional metal. In magnetic systems with broken time reversal symmetry, the resulting Fermi arc plasmons (FAPs) are chiral, with dispersion relations featuring open, hyperbolic constant frequency contours. As a result, a large range of surface plasmon wave vectors can be supported at a given frequency, with corresponding group velocity vectors directed along a few specific collimated directions. Fermi arc plasmons can be probed using near-field photonics techniques, which may be used to launch highly directional, focused surface plasmon beams. The unusual characteristics of FAPs arise from the interplay of bulk and surface Fermi arc carrier dynamics and give a window into the unusual fermiology of Weyl semimetals.

ABSTRACT: It is well-known that the wave of a freely propagating Gaussian beam experiences an additional pi phase shift compared to a plane wave. This phase shift, known as the Gouy phase, has significant consequences in, e.g., nonlinear optics, since the nonlinear processes require high peak intensity and phase matching of the focused beams. Hence, determining and controlling the Gouy phase is crucial in many fields of modern optics and photonics. Here, we develop an analytical model for the Gouy phase of long-range Bessel-Gaussian beams obtained by annihilating highly charged optical vortices. The model accounts for the influence of the relevant experimental parameters (topological charge, radius-to-width ratio of the initial ring-shaped beam, and focal length of the Fourier-transforming lens). We find an evolution of the Gouy phase varying nearly linearly with propagation distance and confirm this result experimentally.(c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

ABSTRACT: With the development of controlled polymerisation, almost all polymerisation strategies have been successfully transplanted to surface-initiated polymerisation. The resulting polymer brushes have emerged as an effective tool for surface functionalization and modulation of the surface properties of materials. To meet various demands it is possible to tailor a material surface with polymer brushes that have diverse dimensionalities, morphologies and compositions. The crowded environment within polymer brushes as well as the stretched conformation of polymer chains sometimes provide unique physicochemical properties, which lead to the delicate creation of inorganic-organic hybridised nanostructures, anti-fouling coatings, biomedical carriers, and materials for use in lubrication, photonics and energy storage. So far, challenges remain in the high-precision synthesis and topological control needed to realize extended applications of polymer brushes. In this Feature Article, we highlight the topology, potential application prospects and various synthetic protocols, particularly for recently established methods, for the efficient synthesis of polymer brushes, as well as their benefits and limitations.

ABSTRACT: On the basis of theoretical analysis and simulations of information signal flows in a photonic network we have designed an optimal measuring network architecture. The system relies on an experimental Nle of multiple senders and multiple receivers. These rules simplify system design. The system consists of PC class working stations equipped with network interfaces, measuring interfaces of photonic input and graphical user's interface. We have proved high efficiency of the measuring network, good reliability, dynamic reconfigurability, interactive operator multi-accessibility, and simultaneous multi- session ability for nondependent measuring processes realized in the network. We have tested the photonics technology based measuring network in laboratory conditions for several basic clients - server configurations. Structural analysis includes dismantling of the system into the basic functional layers accessible through appropriate layers in the graphical user's interface. Topological analysis includes the network interconnections between the functional layers of measuring server and network clients of the measuring system. Analysis allows for prediction of network properties.

ABSTRACT: Polarization rotation of light beams, such as optical activity and Faraday rotation, is a natural effect that generates the rotation of the polarized direction of light and some undiscovered characteristics in nonlinear optics. In our previous study, we theoretically investigated the second-harmonic generation process in rotatory nonlinear optics and found an unprecedented phase-matching condition. Here, the optical phase-matching condition in the second-harmonic generation with rotatory polarization is theoretically analyzed and associated with the angular rotation-induced phases of mixing waves, which goes beyond the previous theoretical analysis. Moreover, the Pancharatnam-Berry topological phase was found to be periodically generated and could be employed to compensate for the mismatched phase during nonlinear optical interaction. Possible experimental schemes were proposed and discussed. This work provides not only a universal and flexible (quasi-) phase-matching condition for the rotatory nonlinear optics existing in most nonlinear optical media but may also inspire the development of modern photonics.

ABSTRACT: The Klein paradox consists in the perfect tunneling of relativistic particles through high potential barriers. It is responsible for the exceptional conductive properties of graphene. It was recently studied in atomic condensates and topological photonics and phononics. While in theory the perfect tunneling holds only for normal incidence, so far the angular dependence of the Klein tunneling and its strong variation with the barrier height were not measured experimentally. In this Letter, we capitalize on the versatility of atomic vapor cells with paraxial beam propagation and index patterning by electromagnetically induced transparency. We report the first experimental observation of perfect Klein transmission in a 2D photonic system (photonic graphene) at normal incidence and measure the angular dependence. Counterintuitively, but in agreement with the Dirac equation, we observe that the decay of the Klein transmission versus angle is suppressed by increasing the barrier height, a key result for the conductivity of graphene and its analogs.

ABSTRACT: Gels self-assembled from colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) translate the size-dependent properties of nanostructures to materials with macroscale volumes. Large spanning networks of NP chains provide high interconnectivity within the material necessary for a wide range of properties from conductivity to viscoelasticity. However, a great challenge for nanoscale engineering of such gels lies in being able to accurately and quantitatively describe their complex non-crystalline structure that combines order and disorder. The quantitative relationships between the mesoscale structural and material properties of nanostructured gels are currently unknown. Here, it is shown that lead telluride NPs spontaneously self-assemble into a spanning network hydrogel. By applying graph theory (GT), a method for quantifying the complex structure of the NP gels is established using a topological descriptor of average nodal connectivity that is found to correlate with the gel's mechanical and charge transport properties. GT descriptions make possible the design of non-crystalline porous materials from a variety of nanoscale components for photonics, catalysis, adsorption, and thermoelectrics.

ABSTRACT: The emerging field of topological acoustics that explores novel gauge-field-related phenomena for sound has drawn attention in recent years. However, previous approaches constructing a synthetic gauge field for sound predominantly relied on a periodic system, being unable to forma uniform effective magnetic field, thus lacking access to some typical magnetic-induced quantum phenomena such as Landau energy quantization. Here we introduce strain engineering, previously developed in graphene electronics and later transferred to photonics, into a two-dimensional acoustic structure in order to form a uniform effective magnetic field for airborne acoustic wave propagation. Landau levels in the energy spectrumcan be formed near the Dirac cone region. We also propose an experimentally feasible scheme to verify the existence of acoustic Landau levels with an acoustic measurement. As a new freedom of constructing a synthetic gauge field for sound, our study offers a path to previously inaccessible magneticlike effects in traditional periodic acoustic structures.

ABSTRACT: The orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light, as an emerging hotspot in optics and photonics, introduces many degrees of freedom for applications ranging from optical communication and quantum processing to micromanipulation. To achieve a high degree of integration, optical circuits for OAM light are essential, which are, however, challenging in the optical regime owing to the lack of well-developed theory. Here we provide a scheme to guide and collimate the OAM beam at the micro-and nano-levels. The coaxial plasmonic slit was exploited as a naturally occurring waveguide for light carrying OAM. Concentric grooves etched on the output surface of the coaxial waveguide were utilized as a plasmonic metasurface to couple the OAM beam to free space with greatly increased beam directivity. Experimental results at lambda = 532 nm validated the novel transportation and collimating effect of the OAM beam. Furthermore, dynamic tuning of the topological charges was demonstrated by using a liquid crystal spatial light modulator (SLM).

ABSTRACT: An approach for filtering the fundamental mode in an integrated optical modulator with multimode waveguides based on etched thin lithium niobate nanofilms is presented. It is shown that metal electrodes can be used as a modal filter to suppress high-order modes in wide multimode ridge waveguides and, consequently, to provide their quasi-single-mode regime of operation. The influence of the gap between the electrodes and its displacement relative to the waveguide symmetry axis is analyzed for various configurations of waveguides. The conditions for quasi-single-mode light propagation with suppression of high-order modes of more than 90 dB/cm are found. The influence of fabrication errors on the efficiency of modal filtering is discussed. Efficient electro-optical modulation with an equivalent voltage-length product of 4 V center dot cm has been experimentally demonstrated on integrated optical phase modulator samples fabricated using conventional contact photolithography. The proposed topological solution can be further used for the fast and cheap fabrication of TFLN modulators by conventional contact photolithography. The proposed modal filtering can also be used in other waveguide topologies and in more complex waveguide devices.

ABSTRACT: In order to utilize the full potential of tailored flows of electromagnetic energy at the nanoscale, we need to understand its general behavior given by its generic representation of interfering random waves. For applications in on-chip photonics as well as particle trapping, it is important to discern between the topological features in the flow-field of the commonly investigated cases of fully vectorial light fields and their 2D equivalents. We demonstrate the distinct difference between these cases in both the allowed topology of the flow-field and the spatial distribution of its singularities, given by their pair correlation function g(r). Specifically, we show that a random field confined to a 2D plane has a divergence-free flow-field and exhibits a liquid-like correlation, whereas its freely propagating counterpart has no clear correlation and features a transverse flow-field with the full range of possible 2D topologies around its singularities.

ABSTRACT: Structured light is one of the frontiers of modern photonics. It refers to the generation of customized optical fields based on wave-front shaping methods. It is a topic of intense research activity due to the wide range of applications in imaging, nonlinear optics, biophotonics (1). We propose, theoretically explore, and experimentally demonstrate optical drill beams presenting nonstationary intensity distributions that resemble the spinning mechanical drill. Optical drills appear as the spatiotemporal interference of two Bessel-vortex beams of different topological charges and different carrier frequencies. By mixing a pair of high-order Bessel beams, synthesized using a liquid crystal spatial light modulator, optical drills of tuned helicities were experimentally observed, and the simplest cases of light matter interaction (fluorescence) with such beams were demonstrated. The rotation in time was achieved by changing the offset of the hologram on the spatial light modulator. Optical drill beams could open new and revolutionary perspectives in dynamical material processing by light or in cell and particle manipulation in biomedical applications.

ABSTRACT: The energy band attraction (EBA) caused by the nonorthogonal eigenvectors is a unique phenomenon in the non-Hermitian (NH) system. However, restricted by the required tight-binding approximation and meticulously engineered complex potentials, such an effect has never been experimentally demonstrated before. Here by a suitable design of all-dielectric Mie resonators in a parallel-plate transmission line, we for the first time verify the photonic analog of the EBA effects both theoretically and experimentally. The evolution of the EBA effect in a two-level NH system from gapped bands to gapless bands to flat bands is observed by precisely tuning the loss of the Mie resonators. The transmission spectra can be theoretically connected to the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the NH Hamiltonian. Furthermore we extend our methods to a graphenelike two-dimensional NH system. Our works show a metamaterial approach toward NH topological photonics and foster a deeper understanding of band theory in open systems.

ABSTRACT: In this work, we investigate multivortex beams with an infinite topological charge. Such optical vortices contain an array of an infinite, but countable, number of phase singularities (isolated intensity nulls), which typically have the unitary topological charge and are located either uniformly (or not uniformly) on a straight line (or on several crossing straight lines) in the beam transverse cross section. Such optical vortices are form invariant and their transverse intensity distribution is conserved on propagation, changing only in scale and rotation. The orbital angular momentum of such optical vortices is finite, since only a finite number of screw dislocations is located within the area of the notable intensity of the Gaussian beam, while the other phase singularities are in the periphery (and in the infinity), where the intensity is very small. Increasing the Gaussian beam waist radius leads to a parabolic growth of the orbital angular momentum of such beams.

ABSTRACT: Wavelength-tunable optical vortices with a topological charge equal to l = 1 of orbital angular momentum (OAM) were experimentally realized using a single off-axis spiral phase mirror (OSPM) with lasers of various visible-light wavelengths. Using an OSPM designed for 561 nm and an incidence angle of 45 degrees, circular doughnut-shaped l=1 optical vortices were obtained at 561, 473, and 660 nm by rotating the OSPM to modify the laser incidence angle. Wavelength-tunable l=1 optical vortices were obtained at the respective incidence angles of 45 degrees, 53.4 degrees, and 33.7 degrees, because the effective geometrical thickness of the OSPM, which determines the order of OAM, was identical at each wavelength. This flexible OSPM which operates over a wide wavelength range will provide continuously wavelength-tunable optical vortices for applications in the fields of advanced optics and photonics in which optical vortices with wide wavelength tenability are in demand.

ABSTRACT: The broadband nonlinear optical material towards the mid-infrared spectral range is highly needed for civil and military applications. Here, we have investigated the nonlinear optical response of the nickel ditelluride (NiTe2) single crystal prepared by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method, and found that the layered NiTe2 exhibits attractive broadband nonlinear optical absorption performance towards the mid-infrared regime. We further explored the nonlinear optical response of the layered NiTe2 in the erbium-doped fluoride fiber laser, and have realized the stable Q-switched fiber laser with a pulse width of 708 ns and a repetition rate of 81 kHz around 2.8 mu m wavelength. The experimental results may not only make inroads towards the understanding the nonlinear optical response of the topological materials, but also explore their broadband applications in mid-infrared photonics.

ABSTRACT: We propose a method for realizing the inhibition of simultaneous excitation of two identical qubits in a single-mode cavity QED system, where two qubits are driven by a coherent field and coupled to a cavity with engineered qubit-cavity interactions. By suitably chosen placements of the qubits in the cavity and by adjusting the relative decay strengths of the qubits and cavity field, we close many unwanted excitation pathways. This leads to an inhibition of the doubly excited state. In addition, we show that these two qubits are strongly entangled over a broad regime of the system parameters. We show that a strong signature of nonexcitation of the doubly excited state is the bunching property of the cavity photons, which thus provides a possible measurement of this nonexcitation. We also present dynamical features of the inhibition of simultaneous excitation of two qubits. The proposal presented in this paper can be realized not only in traditional cavity QED, but also in noncavity topological photonics involving edge modes.

ABSTRACT: We proposed and built a near-field scanning optical microscope (NSOM) to enable the characterization of the spin angular momentum (SAM) distribution of electromagnetic fields with nanoscale resolution. The NSOM probe was composed of a circular nanohole formed in a thick gold film that was deposited on a tapered cone fiber. The near-field signal, when coupled through the nanohole to the fiber, was split and analyzed using a combination of a quarter-wave plate and a polarizer to extract the two circular polarization components of the signal. This allowed us to characterize the out-of-plane SAM component, which was determined using the relationship S-z proportional to I-RCP - I-LCP. Using the developed system, we mapped the SAM distributions of a variety of tightly focused cylindrical vector vortex beams and thus validated the system's effectiveness. The proposed spin-resolved NSOM could be a valuable tool for studies of both near-field spin optics and topological photonics.

ABSTRACT: Optical beam shaping plays a key role in optics and photonics. In this work, meta-q-plate featured by arbitrarily space-variant optical axes is proposed and demonstrated via liquid crystal photoalignment based on a polarization-sensitive alignment agent and a dynamic micro-lithography system. Meta-q-plates with multiple-, azimuthally/radially variant topological charges and initial azimuthal angles are fabricated. Accordingly, complex beams with elliptical, asymmetrical, multi-ringed and hurricane transverse profiles are generated, making the manipulation of optical vortex up to an unprecedented flexibility. The evolution, handedness and Michelson interferogram of the hurricane one are theoretically analysed and experimentally verified. The design facilitates the manipulation of polarization and spatial degrees of freedom of light in a point-to-point manner. The realization of meta-q-plate drastically enhances the capability of beam shaping and may pave a bright way towards optical manipulations, OAM based informatics, quantum optics and other fields.

ABSTRACT: Multilayers based on quantum materials (complex oxides, topological insulators, transition-metal dichalcogenides, etc.) have enabled the design of devices that could revolutionize microelectronics and optoelectronics. However, heterostructures incorporating quantum materials from different families remain scarce, while they would immensely broaden the range of possible applications. Here we demonstrate the large-scale integration of compounds from two highly multifunctional families: perovskite oxides and transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). We couple BiFeO3, a room-temperature multiferroic oxide, and WSe2, a semiconducting two-dimensional material with potential for photovoltaics and photonics. WSe2 is grown by molecular beam epitaxy and transferred on a centimeter-scale onto BiFeO3 films. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we visualize the electronic structure of 1 to 3 monolayers of WSe2 and evidence a giant energy shift as large as 0.75 eV induced by the ferroelectric polarization direction in the underlying BiFeO3. Such a strong shift opens new perspectives in the efficient manipulation of TMD properties by proximity effects.

ABSTRACT: Flat band systems are commonly associated with compact localized states (CLSs) that arise from the macroscopic degeneracy of eigenstates at the flat band energy. However, in the case of singular flat bands, conventional localized flat band states are incomplete, leading to the existence of noncontractible loop states (NLSs) with nontrivial real-space topology. In this study, we experimentally and analytically demonstrate the existence of NLSs in a 2D photonic borophene lattice without a CLS counterpart, owing to a band that is flat only along high-symmetry lines and dispersive along others. Our findings challenge the conventional notion that NLSs are necessarily linked to robust boundary modes due to a bulk-boundary correspondence. Protected by the band flatness that originates from band touching, NLSs play a significant role in investigating the fundamental physics of flat band systems.

ABSTRACT: Gratings(1) and holograms(2) use patterned surfaces to tailor optical signals by diffraction. Despite their long history, variants with remarkable functionalities continue to be developed(3,4). Further advances could exploit Fourier optics(5), which specifies the surface pattern that generates a desired diffracted output through its Fourier transform. To shape the optical wavefront, the ideal surface profile should contain a precise sum of sinusoidal waves, each with a well defined amplitude, spatial frequency and phase. However, because fabrication techniques typically yield profiles with at most a few depth levels, complex 'wavy' surfaces cannot be obtained, limiting the straightforward mathematical design and implementation of sophisticated diffractive optics. Here we present a simple yet powerful approach to eliminate this design-fabrication mismatch by demonstrating optical surfaces that contain an arbitrary number of specified sinusoids. We combine thermal scanning-probe lithography(6-8) and templating(9) to create periodic and aperiodic surface patterns with continuous depth control and sub-wavelength spatial resolution. Multicomponent linear gratings allow precise manipulation of electromagnetic signals through Fourier-spectrum engineering(10). Consequently, we overcome a previous limitation in photonics by creating an ultrathin grating that simultaneously couples red, green and blue light at the same angle of incidence. More broadly, we analytically design and accurately replicate intricate two-dimensional moire patterns(11,12), quasicrystals(13,14) and holograms(15,16), demonstrating a variety of previously unattainable diffractive surfaces. This approach may find application in optical devices (biosensors(17), lasers(18,19), metasurfaces(4) and modulators(20)) and emerging areas in photonics (topological structures(21), transformation optics(22) and valleytronics(23)).

ABSTRACT: In this paper we reveal the physics behind the formation of tri- and tetra-hyperbolic phases in anisotropic metamaterials without magnetoelectric coupling and describe the anti-crossing splitting phenomenon in the hyperbolic dispersion which arises due to the hybridization of the plasmonic and magnetic Bloch high-k polaritons. In hyperbolic metamaterials used for sensing, imaging, and other applications the high-k modes are purely magnetic or electric, which results in purely electric (magnetic) near-fields in response to electric (magnetic) sources. The hybridization predicted in this paper leads to the formation of high-k modes which feature both electric and magnetic fields. This can be used to induce magnetic near fields in response to electric dipole in realistic structures which opens novel avenues in the optical magnetism research. Our work considerably deepens the understanding of the high-k polaritons and the topology of the optical iso-frequency surfaces in k-space and will find applications in optical nano-resolution imaging, emission rate, directivity, and near-field control. To accomplish this, we develop a range of new techniques of theoretical optics for bianisotropic materials, including the quadratic index of refraction operator method, suitable to study the high-k polaritons with finite indices of refraction and the explicit expression for the characteristic matrix in generic bianisotropic media. We introduce the spatial stratification approach for the electric and magnetic responses of anisotropic homogeneous media to analyze the underlying Bloch waves. We believe that the formalisms developed here can be useful for the researchers in the field of theoretical optics of anisotropic and bianisotropic media in the future.

ABSTRACT: We develop and release a photonic band dispersion solver based on the coupled dipole method called CDPDS, which aims to provide an analytical computation of bulk and boundary dispersions and topological phases of a one-dimensional and two-dimensional photonic crystal consisting of an array of particles. The main advantages of CDPDS include (i) a wide coverage of computation that spans the bulk dispersion of a unit cell, boundary dispersion of a supercell comprising one or two types of photonic crystals, and topological phases, (ii) the inclusion of a straightforward graphical user interface that facilitates high accessibility to users who have no expertise in computer programming, and (iii) the addition of built-in options that are useful in examining the photonic dispersions of several widely used systems. The basic principle and computational method incorporated into CDPDS and its performance verification using two distinct photonic crystals are presented in this article. The results indicate that CDPDS will serve as help-ful and accessible guidance for computing photonic band dispersions in the fields of conventional and topological photonics.

Nature of problem: An analytical band dispersion analysis of a photonic crystal composed of an array of particles. The photonic dispersion and physics therein are important in investigating periodically arranged photonic systems. Additionally, there is an increasing demand for free and accessible software based on an analytical framework for computing bulk and boundary dispersions, electromagnetic field distributions, and topological phases of one-dimensional and two-dimensional photonic crystals.

A particle that consists a photonic crystal is modeled as a point dipole with a prespecified polarizability tensor. CDPDS is highly accessible, especially for users who have no expertise in computer programming. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: The coupled dipole method models each sublattice of the photonic crystal of interest to a point dipole.

ABSTRACT: This paper proposed and theoretically examined a double-interfaced one-dimensional photonic crystal het-erostructure for strong localization of topologically protected resonant modes. It is challenging to achieve these modes for a range of wavelengths using a single photonic crystal. The design proposed in this study is a heterostruc-ture of photonic crystals 1 (PC1) and 2 (PC2), and it provides distributed localized modes from the infrared to ultraviolet wavelength ranges. In addition, multiple resonant modes occur at certain photonic bandgaps due to the addition of the third photonic crystal (PC3), which is analytically modeled with the heterostructure of PC1 and PC2. The enhancement in the number of resonant modes depends on the PC2 number of unit-cells and the reflection phase of the proposed heterostructure. The reflection phase is abruptly changing from 0 to pi for sev-eral wavelengths inside the bandgap. These resonance modes are also dependent on the topological behavior of each connected photonic crystal and are immune to small disorder and back-scattering within the crystal. The high-quality factor (Q-factor similar to 107) shows strong light-matter interaction of these multiple resonant modes. The characterization was done in terms of the Zak phase, sign of the reflection phase, and bandgap overlapping. Consequently, this heterostructure may pave the way for new topological photonics and new applications in opto-electronics, frequency up-conversion, photonic devices, rainbow trapping, multiwavelength optical filters, and so on.(c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group

ABSTRACT: Full control of light polarization is one of the most sought-after functionalities in nanophotonics since it allows the replacement of bulky optical components like wave retarders. Here, the study reports the theoretical and experimental demonstration of an ultra-compact dual-mode frequency selective polarization controller that leverages the topological features of symmetry protected quasi-bound states in the continuum (q-BICs) supported by a silicon-based nanostructure. Thanks to q-BIC resonances, arbitrarily polarized incoming light can be converted into linearly polarized light without resorting to the local phase tuning mechanisms that characterize optical metasurfaces. Moreover, the dual-mode operating regime allows to select the transmitted polarization without modifying the device orientation, therefore overtaking the concept of the wire grid polarizer. The experimental findings show that the proposed meta-polarizer possesses an extinction ratio of approximate to 40 dB for two linear cross-polarization excitations. These results pave the way for a novel class of ultra-compact devices that can be used to compensate unwanted birefringence in optical fibers or to control polarization in complex media environments. A properly designed silicon-based metasurface that supports quasi-bound states in the continuum can convert arbitrarily polarized incoming light into either horizontal or vertical linearly polarized light without rotating or actively modifying the nanostructure. The experimental findings show that the proposed meta-polarizer possesses an extinction ratio of approximate to 40dB for two linear cross-polarization excitations.image

ABSTRACT: Polariton condensates have proved to be model systems to investigate topological defects, as they allow for direct and nondestructive imaging of the condensate complex order parameter. The fundamental topological excitations of such systems are quantized vortices. In specific configurations, further ordering can bring the formation of vortex lattices. In this work we demonstrate the spontaneous formation of ordered vortical states, consisting in geometrically self-arranged vortex-antivortex pairs. A mean-field generalized Gross-Pitaevskii model reproduces and supports the physics of the observed phenomenology.

ABSTRACT: Systems supporting Weyl points have gained increasing attention in condensed physics, photonics and acoustics due to their rich physics, such as Fermi arcs and chiral anomalies. Acting as sources or drains of Berry curvature, Weyl points exhibit a singularity of the Berry curvature at their core. It is, therefore, expected that the induced effect of the Berry curvature can be dramatically enhanced in systems supporting Weyl points. In this work, we construct synthetic Weyl points in a photonic crystal that consists of a honeycomb array of coupled rods with slowly varying radii along the direction of propagation. The system possesses photonic Weyl points in the synthetic space of two momenta plus an additional physical parameter with an enhanced Hall effect resulting from the large Berry curvature in the vicinity of the Weyl point. Interestingly, a helical Zitterbewegung (ZB) is observed when the wave packet traverses very close to a Weyl point, which is attributed to the contribution of the non-Abelian Berry connection arising from the near degenerate eigenstates.

ABSTRACT: Light carries both spin and orbital angular momentum. These dynamical properties are determined by the polarization and spatial degrees of freedom of light. Nano-optics, photonics and plasmonics tend to explore subwavelength scales and additional degrees of freedom of structured - that is, spatially inhomogeneous - optical fields. In such fields, spin and orbital properties become strongly coupled with each other. In this Review we cover the fundamental origins and important applications of the main spin-orbit interaction phenomena in optics. These include: spin-Hall effects in inhomogeneous media and at optical interfaces, spin-dependent effects in nonparaxial (focused or scattered) fields, spin-controlled shaping of light using anisotropic structured interfaces (metasurfaces) and robust spin-directional coupling via evanescent near fields. We show that spin-orbit interactions are inherent in all basic optical processes, and that they play a crucial role in modern optics.

ABSTRACT: Vector diffraction theory is employed to investigate the gradient force patterns of the Gaussian beams with helico-conical phase fronts. Results show that the gradient force pattern shape depends principally on topological charge of the phase fronts. The gradient force pattern expands with increasing the parameter of the phase distribution. Therefore, one can change the topological charge or the parameter of the phase mask to construct the tunable optical trap to meet different requirements. Its potential application might include rotational positioning of particles and accumulation of smaller non-symmetric particles towards the focus.

ABSTRACT: The generation and topological configuration of double-layered polarization singularity array (PSA) having paired C-points of opposite topological index through superposing three Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) component beams with orthogonal linear polarization states are demonstrated. The generated PSA beam exhibits diversity in topological geometry and intensity pattern. The topological rule that the zero net topological charge and helicity conservation hold for the entire PSA is also confirmed. Based on our experiment setup consisting of a computer-controlled spatial light modulator (SLM), the PSA morphology can be flexibly customized and dynamically regulated by modulating the parameters of constituent beams. Our scheme provides a convenient device for manipulating polarization singularities and can facilitate the potential applications of singular optics.

ABSTRACT: A geometric and topological analysis of the crystal structures of Li68Ge16-oC84 (a = 4.551 angstrom, b = 22.086 angstrom, c = 13.275 angstrom, V = 13.275 angstrom(3), Cmcm), Li44Ge24-oC68 (a = 4.380 angstrom, b = 24.550 angstrom, c = 10.540 angstrom, V = 1144.11 angstrom(3), Cmcm), and Li12Ge12-tI24 (a = b = 4.053 angstrom, c = 23.282 angstrom(3), I4(1)/amd) intermetallic compounds is carried out. For the Li68Ge16-oC84 intermetallic compound, two new frame-forming clusters are found: K12 = 0@12(Li9Ge3) with symmetry m in the form of linked 5-rings Li3Ge2 and Li4Ge, with the Li atoms located in the center of the 5th rings, and K9 = 0@9(Li3Ge)(Li-3)(2) with symmetry m in the form of linked 3prings (Li-3)(GeLi2)(Li-3). For the Li44Ge24-oC68 intermetallic compound, two new frame-forming clusters are established: K11 = 0@11(LiLi5)(Ge-5) with symmetry m in the form of 5-ring Ge-5 (lying at the base of the pyramid), which are coupled with the 5-atoms of Li, lying in the same plane with the Li atom (top of the pyramid) and K6 = 0@6(GeLi5) with symmetry m in the form of double tetrahedra Li3Ge having a common edge LiGe. For the Li12Ge12-tI24 intermetallic compound, the frame-forming cluster K6 = 0@6(Ge3Li3) with symmetry 2 is found in the form of double tetrahedra Li2Ge2 having a common edge LiGe. The symmetry and topological code of the processes of self-assembly of Li68Ge16-oC84, Li44Ge24-oC68, and Li12Ge12-tI24 crystal structures of cluster-precursors are reconstructed in the following form: primary chain -> layer -> framework.

Two new nanocluster precursors with the -43m symmetry are determined: a three-layer K136 nanocluster of the 0@Zn-12@32(Mg20Zn12@92(Zr12Zn80) composition with an internal icosahedron 0@Zn-12 and 12 Zr atoms and 20 Zn atoms in 60-atomic Zn-shell and a two-layer K30 nanocluster of the 0@Zn-6@Zn-24 composition with an internal Zn-6-octahedron and 24 Zn atoms in the external shell. The symmetrical and topological codes of the self-assembly processes of 3D structures from K136 and K30 nanocluster precursors are reconstructed in the following form: primary chain -> microlayer -> microframework. The Zn-2 dimers are determined as the spacers occupying the voids in the 3D framework from K136 and K30 nanoclusters.

ABSTRACT: This paper proposes a flexible and stable method to generate cylindrical vector vortex beams with different topological charges using Single-polarization Vector Optical Generators (VOG). VOG is composed of two single-polarization responsive cylindrical lenses placed oppositely at a certain distance, which is a convenient implementation of the coherent superposition by means of two orthogonally circularly polarized states instead of path interference of interferometer. In this experiment, the customized computer generated holograms are loaded on the spatial light modulator(SLM) to generate Laguerre Gaussian (LG) beams with arbitrary topological charge, and LG beams convent to vector vortex beams with corresponding topological charge through VOG. The interference pattern of the two beams projected to a linear polarization state also give the cylindrically symmetric petal beams. And the diameters of vector vortex beams with different topological charges are also measured.

ABSTRACT: An Archimedes' Screw captures water, feeding energy into it by lifting it to a higher level. We introduce the first instance of an optical Archimedes' Screw, and demonstrate how this system is capable of capturing light, dragging it and amplifying it. We unveil new exact analytic solutions to Maxwell's Equations for a wide family of chiral space-time media, and show their potential to achieve chirally selective amplification within widely tunable parity-time-broken phases. Our work, which may be readily implemented via pump-probe experiments with circularly polarized beams, opens a new direction in the physics of time-varying media by merging the rising field of space-time metamaterials and that of chiral systems, and offers a new playground for topological and non-Hermitian photonics, with potential applications to chiral spectroscopy and sensing. An Archimedes' screw pumps energy into a fluid by lifting it to a higher ground. An optical screw uses helical space-time modulations in the properties of a material to grab hold of and amplify circularly polarized light of a specific handedness.

ABSTRACT: Owing to the chirality of Weyl nodes, the Weyl systems can support one-way chiral zero modes under a strong magnetic field, which leads to nonconservation of chiral currents-the so-called chiral anomaly. Although promising for robust transport of optical information, the zero chiral bulk modes have not been observed in photonics. Here we design an inhomogeneous Weyl metamaterial in which a gauge field is generated for the Weyl nodes by engineering the individual unit cells. We experimentally confirm the presence of the gauge field and observe the zero-order chiral Landau level with one-way propagation. Without breaking the time-reversal symmetry, our system provides a route for designing an artificial magnetic field in three-dimensional photonic Weyl systems and may have potential for device applications in photonics.

ABSTRACT: The concept of orbital angular momentum has gained significant interest in recent years across various fields of science, particularly in physics and biology. In this article, we present a novel approach to investigating the acceleration and deceleration of the phase distribution of a Laguerre-Gaussian beam. Our model proposes a topological transformation from a canonical vortex to a non-canonical vortex when the beam interacts with a chiral medium, based on a generalized distinguishability property of the vortex. We compare our model's predictions with phase acceleration data from simulations by Liu et al., showing excellent agreement. Additionally, we provide a quantum mechanical interpretation of our model. Our results show that the elliptical beam resulting from passing through a slab of chiral media is a superposition of various LG modes of the topological charge l. We conclude that the distinguishability property of a canonical vortex beam, where ? ? 1/l, holds physical significance and practical relevance.

ABSTRACT: The valley degree of freedom, like the spin degree of freedom in spintronics, is regarded as a new information carrier, promoting the emerging valley photonics. Although there exist topologically protected valley edge states which are immune to optical backscattering caused by defects and sharp edges at the inverse valley Hall phase interfaces composed of ordinary optical dielectric materials, the dispersion and the frequency range of the edge states cannot be tuned once the geometrical parameters of the materials are determined. In this paper, we propose a chirped valley graphene plasmonic metamaterial waveguide composed of the valley graphene plasmonic metamaterials (VGPMs) with regularly varying chemical potentials while keeping the geometrical parameters constant. Due to the excellent tunability of graphene, the proposed waveguide supports group velocity modulation and zero group velocity of the edge states, where the light field of different frequencies focuses at different specific locations. The proposed structures may find significant applications in the fields of slow light, micro-nano-optics, topological plasmonics, and on-chip light manipulation.

ABSTRACT: The photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE), as an exotic analogy to the spin Hall effect in electronics, is induced by the spin-orbit interaction of light and manifests itself as a spin-related splitting of left-and right-handed circularly polarized beams. Recently, the PSHE has been revealed and explored in a wide range of fields such as optical interfaces, metasurfaces/metamaterials, near-field optics, topological and disordered systems, as well as non-Hermitian photonics. Significantly, the PSHE provides the unique spin degrees of freedom to flexibly control light, which has enabled tremendous applications in precise metrology, spin-based nanophotonic devices, and mathematical operations, to name only a few. Also, new methods to manipulate and enhance this effect have been actively pursued. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the key aspects in the PSHE, especially the underlying physics, new techniques of manipulations, and emerging applications. Our review can not only help new researchers of this field in a timely manner but also inspire more efforts in making and engineering PSHE-based devices in coming years.

ABSTRACT: A hyperbolic plasmonic surface supports highly directional propagating polaritons with extremely large density of states. Such plasmon polaritons have been realized in artificially structured metasurfaces. However, the upper bound of the achievable plasmon wave vector is limited by the structure size, which calls for a natural hyperbolic surface without any structuring. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a natural hyperbolic plasmonic surface based on thin films of WTe2 in the light wavelength range of 16 to 23 microns by far infrared absorption spectroscopy. The topological transition from the elliptic to the hyperbolic regime is further manifested by mapping the isofrequency contours of the plasmon. Moreover, the anisotropy character and plasmon frequency exhibit prominent temperature dependence. Our study demonstrates the first natural platform to host 2D hyperbolic plasmons, which opens exotic avenues for the manipulation of plasmon propagation, light-matter interaction and light emission in planar photonics. Hyperbolic plasmonic surfaces supporting highly directional propagating plasmon-polaritons have been realized in artificial metamaterials. Here, the authors demonstrate experimentally a hyperbolic plasmonic surface naturally occurring in thin films of WTe2, a type-II Weyl semimetal with layered structure.

ABSTRACT: "We present a scheme for a molecular memory, which is based on the influence of the positions of chemical side-groups attached to aromatic molecules on the paths for electrons propagating through these molecules in the ballistic and tunnelling transport regimes. Using the elastic scattering quantum chemistry technique in a topological Huckel implementation, we show how it is possible to represent four different output states with a benzene molecule attached to one input and three output electrodes. To achieve this we choose single atomic orbitals as side-groups and by varying their number and positions the desired output pattern is met, at least in the ballistic regime. This case is also compared to the situation where only two electrodes are attached: the differences with respect to the tunnelling regime are analysed in detail. Since our scheme is based on path and therefore phase differences in electronic wave propagation, we also compare its properties with those of other interference-based concepts for information processing, such as quantum computing or photonics."

ABSTRACT: A gyroid crystal possesses a peculiar structural feature that can be conceptualized as a triply periodic surface with a constant mean curvature of zero. The exotic optical properties such as the photonic bandgap and optical chirality can emerge from this three-dimensional (3D) morphological feature. As such, gyroid crystals have been considered as the promising structures for photonic crystals and optical metamaterials. To date, several methods have been proposed to materialize gyroid crystals, including 3D printing, layer-by-layer stacking, two-photon lithography, interference lithography, and self-assembly. Furthermore, the discovery of Weyl points in gyroid crystals has further stimulated these advancements. Among such methods, the self-assembly of block copolymers (BCPs) is unique, because this soft approach can provide an easy-to-craft gyroid, especially at the nanoscale. The unit-cell scale of a gyroid ranging within 30-300 nm can be effectively addressed by BCP self-assembly, whereas other methods would be challenging to achieve this size range. Therefore, a BCP gyroid has provided a material platform for metamaterials and photonic crystals functioning at optical frequencies. Currently, BCP gyroid nanophotonics is ready to take the next step toward topological photonics beyond the conventional photonic crystals and metamaterials. In particular, the intrinsic lattice transformations occurring during the self-assembly of BCP into a gyroid crystal could promise a compelling advantage for advancing Weyl photonics in the optical regime. Lattice transformations are routinely considered as limitations, but in this review, we argue that it is time to widen the scope of the lattice transformations for the future generation of nanophotonics. Thus, our review provides a comprehensive understanding of the gyroid crystal and its lattice transformations, the relevant optical properties, and the recent progress in BCP gyroid self-assembly.

ABSTRACT: The two frequency-modulated superconducting qubits act as a trembling mirror for microwave photons with on-demand tunable directionality. The ability to control the direction of scattered light is crucial to provide flexibility and scalability for a wide range of on-chip applications, such as integrated photonics, quantum information processing, and nonlinear optics. Tunable directionality can be achieved by applying external magnetic fields that modify optical selection rules, by using nonlinear effects, or interactions with vibrations. However, these approaches are less suitable to control microwave photon propagation inside integrated superconducting quantum devices. Here, we demonstrate on-demand tunable directional scattering based on two periodically modulated transmon qubits coupled to a transmission line at a fixed distance. By changing the relative phase between the modulation tones, we realize unidirectional forward or backward photon scattering. Such an in-situ switchable mirror represents a versatile tool for intra- and inter-chip microwave photonic processors. In the future, a lattice of qubits can be used to realize topological circuits that exhibit strong nonreciprocity or chirality.

ABSTRACT: The solar-blind ultraviolet (UV) wavelength is particularly interesting within the range of 200 nm-300 nm. Here, we propose a focusing metalens, focusing vortex beam (VB) metalens and metalens array that specifically work in the UV band to focus a beam or VB. Firstly, a high numerical aperture (NA) focusing metalens working at a wavelength of 214.2 nm was designed, and the NA reached 0.83. The corresponding conversion efficiency of the unit structure reached as high as 94%, and the full width at half maximum was only 117.2 nm. Metalenses with large NA can act as optical tweezers and can be applied to trap ultracold atoms and molecules. Secondly, a focused VB metalens in the wavelength range of 200 nm-300 nm was also designed, which can convert polarized light into a VB and focus the VB simultaneously. Finally, a metalens array was developed to focus VBs with different topological charges on the same focal plane. This series of UV metalenses could be widely used in UV microscopy, photolithography, photonics communication, etc.

ABSTRACT: Geometric phase is a unifying and central concept in physics, including optics. As a matter of fact, optics played a pivotal role from the inception of this new paradigm, as some of the first experimental demonstrations have been carried out in optics. A specific type of geometric phase was first introduced by Pancharatnam while investigating interference effects between different polarizations. This specific type of geometric phase, nowadays called the Pancharatnam-Berry phase, is related to the variation of light polarization, encompassing exotic properties when compared with the dynamic phase associated with the optical path. The most widespread manifestation of the Pancharatnam-Berry phase occurs in the presence of a twisted anisotropic material, yielding a point-wise phase modulation proportional to the local rotation angle of the material. Here the basic mechanism behind the Pancharatnam-Berry phase is discussed. The various applications of this relatively original concept in photonics are then reviewed, presenting both the most important results and manufactured devices reported in literature. The interplay between geometric phase and diffraction occurring in bulk structures is discussed in detail. In the latter case it is shown how geometric phase can be harnessed to generate a new kind of optical waveguide without the necessity of any index gradient.

ABSTRACT: Strong coupling between resonant states is usually achieved by modulating intrinsic parameters of optical systems, e.g., the refractive index of constituent materials or structural geometries. Externally introduced chiral enantiomers may couple resonances, but the extremely weak chirality of natural enantiomers largely prevents the system from reaching strong coupling regimes. Whether weak chirality could induce strong coupling between resonant states remains an open question. Here, we realize strong coupling between quasibound states in the continuum of a high-Q metasurface, assisted with externally introduced enantiomers of weak chirality. We establish a chirality-involved Hamiltonian to quantitatively describe the correlation between the coupling strength and the chirality of such systems, which provides an insightful recipe for enhancing the coupling of resonant states further in the presence of quite weak chirality. Consequently, high-sensitivity chiral sensing is demonstrated, in which the circular dichroism signal is enhanced 3 orders higher than the case without strong coupling. Our findings present a distinct strategy for manipulating optical coupling between resonances, revealing opportunities in chiral sensing, topological photonics, and quantum optics.

ABSTRACT: Non-conservative physical systems admit a special kind of spectral degeneracy, known as exceptional point (EP), at which eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the corresponding non-Hermitian Hamiltonian coalesce. Dynamical parametric encircling of the EP can lead to non-adiabatic evolution associated with a state flip, a sharp transition between the resonant modes. Physical consequences of the dynamical encircling of EPs in open dissipative systems have been explored in optics and photonics. Building on the recent progress in understanding the parity-time (PT)-symmetric dynamics in spin systems, we use topological properties of EPs to implement chiral non-reciprocal transmission of a spin through the material with non-uniform magnetization, like helical magnet. We consider an exemplary system, spin-torque-driven single spin described by the time-dependent non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. We show that encircling individual EPs in a parameter space results in non-reciprocal spin dynamics and find the range of optimal protocol parameters for high-efficiency asymmetric spin filter based on this effect. Our findings offer a platform for non-reciprocal spin devices for spintronics and magnonics.

ABSTRACT: Excitation of the non-radiative eigenmodes in photonics and metamaterials above their light cone, that is, the bound states in the continuum (BICs), has drawn fundamental and technological interest. However, the current studies on photonic BICs are mainly restricted to the characterization of the eigenmodes with fixed point group. Here, a fourfold rotationally symmetric (C-4v) array of silicon resonators in a square lattice is investigated that reveals the traditional symmetry-protected (Gamma-state) and accidental (off-Gamma) BICs in the momentum space. Upon symmetry-breaking, BICs at Gamma-state transform into quasi-states with decaying quality factors that obey the inverse-square law alpha(-2) as a function of the structural asymmetry parameter alpha. Surprisingly, at larger asymmetries, multiple new states of extended BICs are observed beyond typical inverse-square law behavior. The structural asymmetry of a resonator provides an important degree of freedom for exploring the Friedrich-Wintgen and new accidental BICs that are topologically protected by robust polarization vortices. The extended family of sharp BIC resonances in all-dielectric silicon metasurfaces is extremely important for scalable applications in terahertz sensing, higher harmonic generation, and ultralow-power switching.

ABSTRACT: In recent years, due to the limitation of Moore's Law, traditional electronic integrated circuits have been unable to meet the requirements of exponential growth of data traffic. An optical interconnect paradigm with higher density of processing units and lower energy consumption is urgently needed. Highly integrated III-V lasers on silicon are promising candidates for ultra-compact light sources of the next generation on-chip optical interconnect. Here, we present various InAs/GaAs quantum dot microcavity lasers monolithically grown on silicon, including micro-disk lasers, 2D Photonic Crystal lasers with L3 defects, 1D Photonic Crystal nanobeam lasers, Photonic Crystal bandedge lasers, topological corner state lasers, Dirac-vortex topological lasers and vortex lasers based on bound states in the continuum (BIC).

ABSTRACT: A Poincare sphere is a powerful prescription to describe a polarized state of coherent photons, oscillating along certain directions. The polarized state is described by a vector in the sphere, and various passive optical components, such as polarization plates and quartz rotators are able to rotate the vectorial state by changing the phase and the amplitude among two orthogonal basis states. The polarization is originated from spin of photons, and recently, significant attentions have been made for optical Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) as another fundamental degree of freedom for photons. The beam shape of photons with OAM is a vortex with a topological charge at the core, and the state of vortexed photons can be described by a hyper-Poincare sphere. Here, we propose a compact Poincare rotator, which controls a vortexed state of photons in a silicon photonic platform, based on Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) simulations. A ring-shaped gear is evanescently coupled to two silicon photonic waveguides, which convert optical momentum to OAM with both left and right vortexed states. By controlling the relative phase and the amplitude of two traveling waves in input ports, we can control the vortexed states in the hyper-Poincare sphere for photons out of the gear. The impact of the geometrical Pancharatnam-Berry-Guoy's phase and the conservation law of spin and OAM for vortexed photons out of the gear are discussed.

ABSTRACT: "We present a comprehensive study of the fabrication of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowires (NWs) with tailored structural morphologies and functional features by utilizing three major growth methods based on vapor-liquid solid (VLS), vapor-solid (VS), and hydrothermal growth mechanisms. The vertically aligned ZnO NW (ZNW) array can be constructed with tailored length, diameter, and density by controlled catalytic epitaxial VLS growth: the catalyst-free VS growth can create a hierarchical ZNW assembly onto complementary topological frameworks, such as transparent conducting oxides and carbon nanotubes: and the hydrothermal growth practically enables low-temperature growth of conformal ZNWs on large-area and flexible substrates. The growth mechanism and tailoring of the ZNW architectures for each growth strategy were investigated in detail, combined with rational analyses and parametric experiments. This study provides a critical route to the purposeful tailoring of ZNW architectures toward targeted ZnO-driven applications that require specific ZNW morphologies, assembly configurations, and substrate materials for many diverse fields including energy conversion and harvesting, electronics, photonics, and smart and wearable sensors."

ABSTRACT: 2D van der Waals materials are crystals composed of atomic layers, which have atomic thickness scale layers and rich distinct properties, including ultrafast optical response, surface effects, light-mater interaction, small size effects, quantum effects and macro quantum tunnel effects. With the exploration of saturable absorption characteristic of 2D van der Waals materials, a series of potential applications of 2D van der Waals materials as high threshold, broadband and fast response saturable absorbers (SAs) in ultrafast photonics have been proposed and confirmed. Herein, the photoelectric characteristics, nonlinear characteristic measurement technique of 2D van der Waals materials and the preparation technology of SAs are systematically described. Furthermore, the ultrafast pulsed fiber lasers based on classical 2D van der Waals materials including graphene, transition metal chalcogenides, topological insulators and black phosphorus have been fully summarized and analyzed. On this basis, opportunities and directions in this field, as well as the research results of ultrafast pulsed fiber lasers based on the latest 2D van der Waals materials (such as PbO, FePSe3, graphdiyne, bismuthene, Ag2S and MXene etc), are reviewed and summarized.

ABSTRACT: Simulators for photonic quantum information processing (PQIP) experiments are essentially different with currently available quantum-circuit simulators. In PQIP experiments, photons are usually encoded by multiple degrees of freedom, some of which are multi-level or even infinite-level. Moreover, the evolution of indistinguishable photons cannot be described elegantly by the model used in quantum-circuit simulators. A simulator focusing on PQIP experiments is urgently needed, as it plays an important role in PQIP experiments designing and verification. We developed PhotoniQLAB, an object-oriented framework designed for simulating PQIP experiments, which provides a virtual-lab user experience. The core simulation unit is a computer algebraic system based on the second quantization method. PhotoniQLAB only requires users to enter the structure information of a target PQIP experiment to conduct a simulation, as it can understand the topological structure by itself. The mathematical foundation and technical details of PhotoniQLAB are discussed in the paper. The performance of PhotoniQLAB, which is analyzed and used to simulate several experimental schemes in this paper, has been shown to be efficient enough for near-term PQIP experiments. PhotoniQLAB shows its flexibility and universality, through simulating more than 60 existing PQIP experiments in published papers. We believe that PhotoniQLAB will become a fundamental PQIP software infrastructure facilitating the analyses and designs of PQIP experiments.

ABSTRACT: A geometric and topological analysis of the crystal structure of the Li10Mg34Cu24Ga71-hP139 (a = 14.080 angstrom, c = 13.625 angstrom, V = 2339.36 angstrom(3), P-6m2) and Ca2LiInGe2-oP24 (a = 7.251, 4.940 angstrom, b = 4.438 angstrom, c = 16.902 angstrom, V = 543.9 angstrom(3), Pnma) intermetallic compounds is carried out. For the Li10Mg34Cu24Ga71-hP139 intermetallic compound, using the method of the complete decomposition of the 3D factor graph into cluster structures, 1319 variants of the cluster representation of the 3D atomic grid with three to nine structural units are found. Two frame-forming nanoclusters K57 = Li@15(Ga6Cu9)@41(Cu15Mg26) with the internal Frank-Kasper polyhedron Li@15(Ga6Cu9) and K41 = 0@8(Mg2Ga6) @ 33(Li6Mg3Ga24) with an internal polyhedron in the form of a hexagonal bipyramid 0@8(Mg2Ga6) are established. The center of the K57 and K41 cluster-precursor is in positions 1f and 1c with symmetry g = -6m2. The large frame cavity contains double LiGa13, which are polyhedra centered at position 1b. For the Ca2LiInGe2-oP24 intermetallic compound, the K5 = 0@Ca2LiInGe cluster-precursor is found in the form of a triangular bipyramid with Li, In, and Ge atoms lying at the base of the bipyramid and Ca atoms, which are the vertices of the bipyramid. The symmetry and topological code of the processes of self-assembly of the Li10Mg34Cu24Ga71-hP139 and Ca2LiInGe2-oP24 crystal structures of the cluster-precursors is reconstructed in the following form: primary chain -> layer -> framework.

ABSTRACT: "The correlation singularities of a partially coherent Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) electromagnetic beam in a uniaxial crystal is shown to possess interesting evolution behavior. The analytical formula for the cross-spectral density matrix of a partially coherent LG electromagnetic beam propagating in a uniaxial crystal orthogonal to the optical axis is derived. It is found that the correlation singularities of a partially coherent LG electromagnetic beam in a uniaxial crystal is closely determined by the spatial coherence and mode orders of the beam, and the refractive indexes of the crystal. For a partially coherent LG electromagnetic beam, the correlation singularities can propagate further in a uniaxial crystal than that in isotropic medium. For a fully coherent LG electromagnetic beam, in isotropic medium the central correlation singularities and circular edge dislocations persist upon propagation: in a uniaxial crystal the circular edge dislocations become imperfect, and the central correlation singularities with topological charges l not equal 1 split up into correlation singularities with topological charges equaling ."

ABSTRACT: Optical vector vortex beams provide additional degrees of freedom for spatially distinguishable channels in data transmission. Although several coherent light sources carrying a topological singularity have been reported, it remains challenging to develop a general strategy for designing ultra-small, high-quality photonic nanocavities that generate and support optical vortex modes. Here we demonstrate wavelength-scale, low-threshold, vortex and anti-vortex nanolasers in a C5 symmetric optical cavity formed by a topological disclination. Various photonic disclination cavities are designed and analysed using the similarities between tight-binding models and optical simulations. Unique resonant modes are strongly confined in these cavities, which exhibit wavelength-scale mode volumes and retain topological charges in the disclination geometries. In the experiment, the optical vortices of the lasing modes are clearly identified by measuring polarization-resolved images, Stokes parameters and self-interference patterns. Demonstration of vortex nanolasers using our facile design procedure will pave the way towards next-generation optical communication systems. Wavelength-scale, low-threshold, vortex and anti-vortex nanolasers with topological charges in an optical cavity that is formed by a topological disclination are demonstrated, paving a way towards the development of ultra-small light sources with quantized vector vortex states attractive for optical communication systems.

ABSTRACT: The relationship of topological insulators and superconductors and the field of nonlinear dynamics is widely unexplored. To address this subject, we adopt the linear coupling geometry of the Su-Schrieffe-rHeeger model, a paradigmatic example for a topological insulator, and render it nonlinearly in the context of superconducting circuits. As a consequence, the system exhibits topologically enforced bifurcations as a function of the topological control parameter, which finally gives rise to chaotic dynamics, separating phases that exhibit clear topological features.

ABSTRACT: Vortex beam carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) can significantly promote the transmission capacity since the unlimited orthogonal eigenstates of OAM increase the channels of wireless communications. However, the nature of divergence characteristics makes it difficult for receiving and demodulating with the increase of topological charge and propagation distance. The traditional methods for generating vortex beam include spiral phase plate, ring array antenna, computer-generated holograms, all of which suffer from large volume and complicated fabrication. Met asurface exhibits excellent electromagnetic control ability and has the advantages of small size and high integration. In this paper, a high-efficiency broadband metasurface vortex beam generator is proposed with three-layer complementary square ring resonator (CSRR) arrays. By judicious design the phase distribution of the metasurface, vortex beam with different topological charges (l = +/- 1, +/- 2, +/- 3) can be concentrated in the same region at microwave frequencies. By engineering the expanding phase distribution with different topological charges, the proposed method has potential to address the challenges of practical applications with vortex beam.

ABSTRACT: "The thermal blooming effect of power-exponent-phase vortex (PEPV) beam propagating in the atmosphere is investigated by employing the multiple phase screen method. The influences of propagation distance, topological charge, power exponent, wind speed, and absorption coefficient on thermal blooming effect are analyzed in detail. The results show that (1) the thermal blooming effect exhibits a significant perturbation on the intensity and phase distribution of PEPV beams, with its influence becoming more pronounced as the propagation distance increases: (2) when the power exponent is fixed at 4, comparing the thermal blooming effect of PEPV beams with different topological charges indicates that a PEPV beam with topological charges of 3 is the most sensitive to thermal blooming: (3) when the topological charge is fixed at 3, the thermal blooming effect decreases with the increase in power exponent: and (4) an increase in wind speed or a decrease in absorption coefficient can reduce the thermal blooming effect. The research results obtained in this article have guiding significance for the application of research into high-energy PEPV beams in the atmosphere."

ABSTRACT: The properties of optical vortex provide new insights into a wide range of optical and physical phenomena, giving rise to numerous applications in multiple disciplines. Notably, as much as the associated technologies have become increasingly flexible, it is still challenging to simultaneously generate multiple longitudinal polarization optical vortices with random topological charges (l) and tunable intensities at arbitrary positions. Herein, a novel approach that, by manipulating phase and amplitude at the back pupil of a high numerical-aperture (NA) objective, realizes arbitrary longitudinal polarization vortices within the tightly focused light field is developed. Building upon the same model, the impacts of polarization on the optical vortex field and its potential of tuning the ratio of the longitudinal polarization component are further investigated.

ABSTRACT: Axion fields provide a unique way to understand large quantized electromagnetic responses in topological insulators and dynamics in Weyl semimetals. This Review discusses the theory of axion fields in condensed matter, their experimental realization and their application in next-generation devices. Axions are hypothetical particles that were proposed to solve the strong charge-parity problem in high-energy physics. Although they have long been known in quantum field theory, axions have so far not been observed as elementary particles in nature. Yet, in condensed-matter systems, axions can also emerge as quasiparticles in certain materials such as strong topological insulators. The corresponding axion field is expected to lead to exciting physical phenomena in condensed-matter systems, such as a fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect, the chiral anomaly, exotic Casimir-Lifshitz repulsion and a linear magnetoelectric response quantized in units of the fine-structure constant. First signatures of electronic states that permit axion dynamics have been reported in condensed-matter systems. In this Review, we explore the concepts that introduce axion fields in condensed-matter systems and present experimental findings. We discuss predicted and realized material systems, the prospects of using axion electrodynamics for next-generation devices and the search for axions as a possible constituent of dark matter.

ABSTRACT: It is shown theoretically that an astigmatic transformation of an edge dislocation (straight line of zero intensity) of the.-th order (nu = n + alpha is a real positive number, n is integer, 0 < alpha < 1 is the fractional part of the number) forms at twice the focal length from a cylindrical lens n optical elliptical vortices (screw dislocations) with a topological charge of -1, located on a straight line perpendicular to the edge dislocation. Coordinates of these points are zeros of the Tricomi function. At some distance from these vortices and on the same straight line, another additional vortex with a topological charge of -1 is also generated, which moves to the periphery if a decreases to zero, or approaches n vortices if alpha tends to 1. In addition, at the periphery in the beam cross-section, a countable number of optical vortices (intensity zeros) are formed, all with a topological charge of -1, which are located on diverging curved lines (such as hyperbolas) equidistant from a straight line on which the main n intensity zeros are located. These accompanying vortices approach the center of the beam, following the additional passenger vortex, if 0 < alpha < 0.5, or move to the periphery, leaving the passenger next to the main vortices, if 0.5 < alpha < 1. At alpha = 0 and alpha = 1, the accompanying vortices are situated at infinity. The topological charge of the entire beam at fractional. is infinite. The numerical simulation confirms theoretical predictions.

ABSTRACT: Metasurfaces have attracted increasing attention due to their unprecedented capabilities of molding optical fields with exceedingly low losses. Despite significant achievements, most existing metasurfaces are passive and lack dynamic modulation post-fabrication. Here, we propose a tunable phase-change metasurface for switchable vector vortex beam generation in the mid-infrared range. The phase-change meta-molecule, consisting of two coupled Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) bricks, is firstly designed to perform the switching between a quarter-wave plate and a usual transmissive plate over a wavelength range from 4.95 to 5.05 mu m under the amorphous and crystalline phases of GST, respectively. Furthermore, a general method is derived to achieve a switchable vector vortex beam generator at the target wavelength of 5 mu m by spatially orienting GST meta-molecules to locally tailor phase and polarization distribution. Under the amorphous phase, radially polarized and azimuthally polarized beams, composed of the co-polarized circularly polarized (CP) component carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) with a topological charge of l = 0 and cross-polarized CP component carrying OAM with a topological charge of l = +/- 2 are obtained for the left circularly polarized (LCP) and right circularly polarized (RCP) incident waves, respectively. The mode purity values of the cross-polarized component and the co-polarized component are calculated to be similar to 0.949 and similar to 0.955. When GST transits to its crystalline phase, the vector vortex beam disappears, and the incident CP beams pass through directly. Our finding paves the way for advanced applications targeting photonics integration with switchable functionalities.

ABSTRACT: We investigate the Fraunhofer diffraction of a Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beam incident on a dynamic superposed dual-triangular aperture. The evolution of the diffraction pattern from this aperture is analyzed experimentally and theoretically. A special aperture, called the hex-star triangular aperture, demonstrates interesting diffraction patterns. Further, the diffraction properties of integer, half-integer, and fractional orders of topological charges at the Fraunhofer zone are studied by using the hex-star triangular aperture. This study can provide additional information to enhance the understanding of the diffraction properties of the LG beam transmitted through a complex aperture.

ABSTRACT: Among transition metal dichalcogenides, molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe2) holds significant attention due to its polymorphic nature including semiconducting, metallic, and topological semimetal phases. Considerable efforts are devoted to synthesizing MoTe2 nanosheets to make them suitable for device integration in nanotechnologies and for fundamental investigations. In this respect, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) via tellurization of a pre-deposited Mo thin film is an easy and flexible way for synthesizing large scale MoTe2 nanosheets. Here, the study report on the CVD of large-area (up to 4 cm x 1 cm) MoTe2 nanosheets with pure 1T' and 2H phase selection by design. Within the tellurization scheme, the vapor-solid reaction between the pre-deposited molybdenum film and tellurium vapor is studied thus optimizing the scalability and quality of the MoTe2 nanosheets grown on SiO2/Si substrates. It is demonstrated that the MoTe2 structure and morphology are kinetically dictated by the tellurium concentration gradient on the reaction site with varying geometric configurations inside the CVD reactor. This study provides a pivot scheme for enabling scalable 1T' and 2H-MoTe2 integration in applications for novel micro- and nano-electronics, spintronics, photonics, and thermoelectric devices.

ABSTRACT: Thanks to progresses in material science and nanotechnologies, surfaces and thin films can now be structured at different scales. Photonics components take benefit of this possibility to fulfill still more and more complex functions. They are composed as well of organic as inorganic materials, dielectric, semiconductor, and metallic materials, or a mixture of them. Multiscale and chiral structures can be used to control both spectral, spatial distribution of light together with its polarization state. The optical mode density in the near field and in the far field can then be designed in particular by combining more or less resonant structures for the optical waves, associating diffraction, interferences and anisotropic structures like Fabry-Perot, waveguide, plasmons, photonic crystals... Artificially nanostructured materials often called metamaterials exhibit new properties. Different phenomena recently considered, including optical topological insulator and structures for vortex waves transporting angular momentum of photons, will be also discussed and illustrated. With the development of nanometer size structures another step is overtaken allowing the control of the intimate interaction of optical waves with materials to tune their basic electronic properties and permittivity. Both optical and electronic properties are also strongly dependent on coupling effects needing a global approach.

ABSTRACT: Optical vortices (OVs) carrying orbital angular momentum have been an emerging research area due to their widespread applications ranging from optical communication to particle trapping. However, conventional OV generators suffer from bulky configurations and limited performance. Here, we design and experimentally demonstrate high-efficiency focused OV generation by using geometric gap-surface plasmon metalenses with spin-flipped focal planes, where the polarization states, positions, and corresponding topological charges of the OVs can be controlled by changing the spin of incident circularly polarized light, reproducing thereby the combined functionalities of a lens and a q-plate. The fabricated dual-polarity OV metalens features the polarization conversion ratios above 88% and efficiencies exceeding 50% for both right-handed and left-handed circularly polarized light in a wide wavelength range of 850 to 1000nm. We further extend this approach to realize a multiple-focal OV metalens with distinct and spin-multiplexed OVs at four different longitudinal focal planes. Compared to conventional OV generators, the proposed OV metalenses are compact, ultrathin, and multiplexed, therefore opening an innovative avenue for advanced research and applications aiming at multiple functionalities and dense integration in photonics.

ABSTRACT: We study artificial neural networks with nonlinear waves as a computing reservoir. We discuss universality and the conditions to learn a dataset in terms of output channels and nonlinearity. A feed-forward three-layered model, with an encoding input layer, a wave layer, and a decoding readout, behaves as a conventional neural network in approximating mathematical functions, real-world datacets, and universal Boolean gates. The rank of the transmission matrix has a fundamental role in assessing the learning abilities of the wave. For a given set of training points, a threshold nonlinearity for universal interpolation exists. When considering the nonlinear Seta Winger equation, the use of highly nonlinear regimes implies that solitons, rogue, and shock waves do have a leading role in training and computing. Our results may enable the realization of novel machine learning devices by using diverse physical systems, as nonlinear optics, hydrodynamics, polaritonics, and Bose-Einstein condensates. The application of these concepts to photonics opens the way to a large class of accelerators and new computational paradigms. In complex wave systems, as multimodal fibers, integrated optical circuits, random, topological devices, and metasurfaces, nonlinear waves can be employed to perform computation and solve complex combinatorial optimization.

ABSTRACT: The magneto-optical (MO) materials are essential for designing nonreciprocal devices, like isolators and circulators. Even though the study of MO effect has a long history, the recent works of fabricating nonreciprocal nanostructures, novel MO metamaterials, and topological photonics have garnered significant attention in both theoretical and experimental research of MO materials. In this work, we consider the planar MO waveguide mode. By setting the general form of the fields and utilizing the boundary conditions, the analytical solution of MO modes is obtained. We have shown the potential of such effective solution in analyzing the dispersions and transport behaviors of MO modes in the waveguide. Crossings and avoided crossings of modes will happen, which may due to the strong coupling of TE and TM modes in the waveguide. Faraday rotation can be observed during the propagation of MO modes and the energy flow will precess in the waveguide. These results can be applied in predicting the evolution of the modes in MO waveguides, which has potential in designing MO nonreciprocal devices.(c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

ABSTRACT: "We propose a scheme to generate nonreciprocal photon blockade in a stationary whispering gallery microresonator system based on two physical mechanisms. One of the two mechanisms is inspired by recent work [Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 083604 (2022)], where the quantum squeezing caused by parametric interaction not only shifts the optical frequency of propagating mode but also enhances its optomechanical coupling, resulting in a nonreciprocal conventional photon blockade phenomenon. On the other hand, we also give another mechanism to generate stronger nonreciprocity of photon correlation according to the destructive quantum interference. Comparing these two strategies, the required nonlinear strength of parametric interaction in the second one is smaller, and the broadband squeezed vacuum field used to eliminate thermalization noise is no longer needed. All analyses and optimal parameter relations are further verified by numerically simulating the quantum master equation. Our proposed scheme opens a new avenue for achieving the nonreciprocal single photon source without stringent requirements, which may have critical applications in quantum communication, quantum information processing, and topological photonics.& COPY: 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement"

ABSTRACT: Exceptional points (EPs), i.e., non-Hermitian degeneracies at which eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce, can be realized by tuning the gain/loss contrast of different modes in non-Hermitian systems or by engineering the asymmetric coupling of modes. Here we demonstrate a mechanism that can achieve EPs of arbitrary order by employing the non-reciprocal coupling of spinning cylinders sitting on a dielectric waveguide. The spinning motion breaks the time-reversal symmetry and removes the degeneracy of opposite chiral modes of the cylinders. Under the excitation of a linearly polarized plane wave, the chiral mode of one cylinder can unidirectionally couple to the same mode of the other cylinder via the spin-orbit interaction associated with the evanescent wave of the waveguide. The structure can give rise to arbitrary-order EPs that are robust against spin-flipping perturbations, in contrast to conventional systems relying on spin-selective excitations. In addition, we show that higher-order EPs in the proposed system are accompanied by enhanced optical isolation, which may find applications in designing novel optical isolators, nonreciprocal optical devices, and topological photonics.

ABSTRACT: Phonons with chirality determine the optical helicity of inelastic light scattering processes due to their nonzero angular momentum. Here it is shown that 2D magnetic CrBr3 hosts chiral phonons at the Brillouin-zone center. These chiral phonons are linear combinations of the doubly-degenerate E-g phonons, and the phonon eigenmodes exhibit clockwise and counterclockwise rotational vibrations corresponding to angular momenta of l = +/- 1. Such E-g chiral phonons completely switch the polarization of incident circularly polarized light. On the other hand, the non-degenerate non-chiral A(g) phonons display a giant magneto-optical effect under an external out-of-plane magnetic field, rotating the plane of polarization of the scattered linearly polarized light. The corresponding degree of polarization of the scattered light changes from 91% to -68% as the magnetic field strength increases from 0 to 5 T. In contrast, the chiral E-g modes display no field dependence. The results lay a foundation for the study of phonon chirality and magneto-optical phenomena in 2D magnetic materials, as well as their related applications, such as the phonon Hall effect, topological photonics, and Raman lasing.

ABSTRACT: Data center network architecture is driven by the economics of reach. Although electrical interconnect remains the most cost-effective solution for short-reach communication, its reach has shrunk considerably as signalling rates have increased, and is set to shrink further. Correspondingly, the crossover point between electrical and optical links continues to move to shorter distances as well. At the same time, silicon photonics technology is enabling integration of optical I/O with analog and digital electronics within the same package, drastically reducing the cost differential between optical I/O and electrical I/O. The coincidence of these two trends is set to cause a perfect storm in datacenter network architecture that will invalidate existing assumptions and require re-evaluation of prevalent architectural best practices. We first review how reach has shaped datacenter networks, introduce the requisite technology platform that enables inpackage optics, and discuss the potentially disruptive implications this has on datacenter network architecture. We show how in-package optics gives rise to a repartitioning of chassis switch architecture to reduce cost and power, overcomes the reach limitation of DAC cables and backplane traces in favor of direct fiber connectivity, and enables much greater topological freedom.

ABSTRACT: Symmetry breaking plays a significant role in the determination of the fascinating physical phenomena and quantum phase transitions in 2D materials. This Review discusses the state-of-the-art physical and chemical approaches to engineer the symmetry breaking of 2D materials and their heterostructures. Symmetry breaking in 2D layered materials plays a significant role in their macroscopic electrical, optical, magnetic and topological properties, including, but not limited to, spin-polarization effects, valley-contrasting physics, nonlinear Hall effects, nematic order, ferroelectricity, Bose-Einstein condensation and unconventional superconductivity. Engineering symmetry breaking of 2D layered materials not only offers extraordinary opportunities to tune their physical properties but also provides unprecedented possibilities to introduce completely new physics and technological innovations in electronics, photonics and optoelectronics. Indeed, over the past 15 years, a wide variety of physical, structural and chemical approaches have been developed to engineer the symmetry breaking of 2D layered materials. In this Technical Review, we focus on the recent progress on engineering the breaking of inversion, rotational, time-reversal and gauge symmetries in 2D layered materials, and present our perspectives on how these may lead to new physics and applications.

ABSTRACT: Mimicking natural botanical/zoological systems has revolutionarily inspired fourbiomedical devices, and self-adaptive photonics. The controllable high-freedom shape reconfiguration holds the key to satisfying the ever-increasing demands. However, miniaturized biocompatible 4D hydrogels remain rigorously stifled due to current approach/material limits. In this research, we spatiotemporallyprogram micro/ nano (mu/n) hydrogels through a heterojunction geometric strategy in femtosecond laser direct writing (fsLDW). Polyethylene incorporated N-isopropylacrylamide as programmable interactive materials here. Dynamic chiral torsion, site-specific mutation, anisotropic deformation, selective structural coloration of hydrogel nanowire, and spontaneous self-repairing as reusable mu/n robotics were identified. Hydrogel-materialized monolayer nanowires operate as the most fundamental block at nanometric accuracy to promise high freedom reconfiguration and high force-to-weight ratio/bending curvature under tight topological control. Taking use of this biomimetic fsLDW, we spatiotemporally constructed several in/out-plane selfdriven hydrogel grippers, diverse 2D-to-3D transforming from the same monolayer shape, responsive photonic crystal, and self-clenched fists at mu/n scale. Predictably, the geometry-modulable hydrogels would open new access to massively-reproducible robotics, actuators/sensors for microenvironments, or lab-on-chip devices.

ABSTRACT: Spin and orbital angular momenta are two of the most fundamental physical quantities that describe the complex dynamic behaviors of optical fields. A strong coupling between these two quantities leads to many intriguing spatial topological phenomena, where one remarkable example is the generation of a helicity-dependent optical vortex that converts spin to orbital degrees of freedom. The spin-to-orbit conversion occurs inherently in lots of optical processes and has attracted increasing attention due to its crucial applications in spin-orbit photonics. However, current researches in this area are mainly focused on the monochromatic optical fields whose temporal properties are naturally neglected. In this work, we demonstrate an intriguing temporal evolution of the spin-to-orbit conversion induced by tightly-focused femtosecond optical fields. The results indicate that the conversion in such a polychromatic focused field obviously depends on time. This temporal effect originates from the superposition of local fields at the focus with different frequencies and is sensitive to the settings of pulse width and central wavelength. This work can provide fundamental insights into the spin-orbit dynamics within ultrafast wave packets, and possesses the potential for applications in spin-controlled manipulations of light.

ABSTRACT: The formation of moire superlattices in twisted van der (vdW) homostructures provides a versatile platform for designing the electronic band structure of two-dimensional (2D) materials. In graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) moire systems, twist angle has been shown to be a key parameter for regulating the moire superlattice. However, the effect of the modulation of the twist angle on moire potential and interlayer coupling has not been the subject of experimental investigation. Here, we report the observation of the modulation of moire potential and intralayer excitons in the WS2/WS2 homostructure. By accurately adjusting the torsion angle of the homobilayers, the depth of the moire potential can be modulated. The confinement effect of the moire potential on the intralayer excitons was further demonstrated by the changing of temperature and valley polarization. Furthermore, we show that a detection of atomic reconstructions by the low-frequency Raman mapping to map out inhomogeneities in moire lattices on a large scale, which endows the uniformity of interlayer coupling. Our results provide insights for an in-depth understanding of the behaviors of moire excitons in the twisted van der Waals homostructure, and promote the study of electrical engineering and topological photonics.

ABSTRACT: Photons with spin angular momentum possess intrinsic chirality, which underpins many phenomena including nonlinear optics(1), quantum optics(2), topological photonics(3) and chiroptics(4). Intrinsic chirality is weak in natural materials, and recent theoretical proposals(5-7) aimed to enlarge circular dichroism by resonant metasurfaces supporting bound states in the continuum that enhance substantially chiral light-matter interactions. Those insightful works resort to three-dimensional sophisticated geometries, which are too challenging to be realized for optical frequencies(8). Therefore, most of the experimental attempts(9-11) showing strong circular dichroism rely on false/extrinsic chirality by using either oblique incidence(9,10) or structural anisotropy(11). Here we report on the experimental realization of true/intrinsic chiral response with resonant metasurfaces in which the engineered slant geometry breaks both in-plane and out-of-plane symmetries. Our result marks, to our knowledge, the first observation of intrinsic chiral bound states in the continuum with near-unity circular dichroism of 0.93 and a high quality factor exceeding 2,663 for visible frequencies. Our chiral metasurfaces may lead to a plethora of applications in chiral light sources and detectors, chiral sensing, valleytronics and asymmetric photocatalysis.

ABSTRACT: Photonic spin-orbit interactions (SOI) provide a new design paradigm of functional nanomaterials and nanostructures, and have especially accelerated advances in spin-orbit photonics. The berry phase or the geometric phase, a salient property of SOI, plays a vital role in this process. Thus, the characterization of photonic SOI processes together with the Berry phase is highly demanded for studies such as the optical spin-Hall effect, spin-to-vortex conversion, and Rashba effect. Here, a spin-selective and phase-resolved near-field microscopic method is proposed and experimentally demonstrated for real-time probing and direct visualization of photonic SOI at mesoscale, and a 3D tomographic technique for imaging the spatial evolutions of the optical phases is also properly realized. By analyzing a metallic metasurface as a spin-to-vortex conversion platform, the abrupt geometric phase and the spatially evolutional dynamic phases are directly measured and intuitively illustrated. This work provides a powerful tool for the study of spin-orbit phenomena in near-field optics, and can hold the promise for directly exploring the spin-dependent surface states in plasmonics and photonic topological insulators.

ABSTRACT: Anomalous field enhancement accompanied by resonant absorption phenomenon was originally discussed in the context of plasma physics and in applications related to radio-communications between the ground and spacecraft returning to Earth. Indeed, there is a critical period of time when all communications are lost due to the reflection/absorption of electromagnetic waves by the sheath of plasma created by a high speed vehicle re-entering the atmosphere. While detailed experimental studies of these phenomena in space are challenging, the emergence of electromagnetic metamaterials enables researchers exceptional flexibility to study them in the laboratory environment. Here, we experimentally demonstrated the strong localized field enhancement of magnetic field for an electromagnetic wave propagating in Mie-resonance-based inhomogeneous metamaterials with magnetic permeability gradually changing from positive to negative values. Although these experiments were performed in the microwave frequency range, the proposed all-dielectric approach to transition metamaterials can be extended to terahertz, infrared, and visible frequencies. We anticipate that these results, besides most basic science aspects, hold the potential for numerous applications, including low-intensity nonlinear transformation optics, topological photonics, and the broader area of surface and interface science.

ABSTRACT: The angular velocity of a vaterite microsphere spinning in the optical trap is measured using rotational Doppler effect. The perfectly spherical vaterite microspheres are synthesized via coprecipitation in the presence of silk fibroin nanospheres. When trapped by a circularly polarized beam, the vaterite microsphere is uniformly rotated in the trap center. The probe beams containing two Laguerre-Gaussian beams of opposite topological charge l = +/- 7, l = +/- 8, and l = +/- 9 are illuminated on the spinning vaterite. By analyzing the backscattered light, a frequency shift is observed scaling with the rotation rate of the vaterite microsphere. The multiplicative enhancement of the frequency shift proportion to the topological charge has greatly improved the measurement precision. The reliability and practicability of this approach are verified through varying the topological charge of the probe beam and the trapping laser power. In consideration of the excellent measurement precision of the rotation frequency, this technique might be generally applicable in studying the torsional properties of micro-objects. (c) The Authors.

ABSTRACT: We recently discovered that C-shaped sub-wavelength (nano) metallic apertures when irradiated at specific resonance frequencies have extraordinary power transmission five to six orders of magnitude beyond what is observed for conventional round or square apertures. These apertures produce optical spot sizes as small as 25-50 nm using visible light in the near-field of the aperture with a brightness 10-100 times higher than that of the illuminating beam. A proper understanding into this remarkable phenomenon can aid in the development and understanding of a multitude of applications of these apertures including dense data storage, particle manipulation, and nanoscale photonic devices. Current scalar visualization approaches typically are insufficient to significantly aid in the understanding of these complex near-field optical problems. For example, two common approaches involving either visualization of scalar electromagnetic wave amplitudes in 2-D or rudimentary arrow plots of the vector fields produced in Finite-Difference-Time-Domain simulations are clearly inadequate. Both techniques provide only partial insight into the problem, as only specific planes can be visualized and therefore the global structure of the fields cannot be readily inferred. Understanding of the three-dimensional electromagnetic vector fields and energy flows related to the illumination of nano-sized apertures is critically important in near-field applications, as simple scalar analysis is not suitable at these small dimensions [8]. An ideal visualization tool that has not been used before in studying the optical behavior of near-field apertures is three-dimensional vector field topology. The global view of the vector field structure is deduced by locating singularities (critical points) within the field and augmenting these points with nearby streamlines. We have used for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, three-dimensional topology to analyze the topological differences between a resonant C-shaped nano-aperture and various non-resonant conventional apertures. The topological differences between these apertures are related to the superiority in power throughput of the C-aperture versus conventional round and square sub-wavelength apertures. We demonstrate how topological visualization techniques provide significant insight into the energy enhancement mechanism of the C aperture, and also shed light on critical issues related to the interaction between multiple apertures located in close proximity to each other, which gives rise to cross-talk, for example as a function of distance. Topological techniques allow us to develop design rules for the geometry of these apertures and their desired spot sizes and brightness. The performance of various sub-wavelength apertures can also be compared quantitatively based on their topology. Since topological methods are generically applicable to tensor and vector fields, our approach can be readily extended to provide insight into the broader category of Finite-Difference-Time-Domain nano-photonics and nano-science problems.

ABSTRACT: Using the Richards-Wolf formalism, we obtain general expressions for all components of the electric and magnetic strength vectors near the sharp focus of an optical vortex with the topological charge m and nth-order azimuthal polarization. From these equations, simple consequences are derived for different values of m and n. If m = n > 1, there is a non-zero intensity on the optical axis, like the one observed when focusing a vortex-free circularly polarized light field. If n = m + 2, there is a reverse flux of light energy near the optical axis in the focal plane. The derived expressions can be used both for simulating the sharp focusing of optical fields with the double singularity (phase and polarization) and for a theoretical analysis of focal distributions of the intensity and the Poynting vector, allowing one to reveal the presence of rotational symmetry or the on-axis reverse energy flux, as well as the focal spot shape (a circle or a doughnut).

ABSTRACT: Transition metal dichalcogenides transition metal dichalcogenides have attracted much attention recently due to their potential applications in spintronics and photonics because of the indirect to direct band gap transition and the emergence of the spin-valley coupling phenomenon upon moving from the bulk to monolayer limit. Here, we report high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy on MoSe2 single crystals and monolayer films of MoS2 grown on highly ordered pyrolytic graphite substrate. Our experimental results resolve the Fermi surface trigonal warping of bulk MoSe2, and provide evidence for the critically important spin-orbit split valence bands of monolayer MoS2. Moreover, we systematically image the formation of quantum well states on the surfaces of these materials, and present a theoretical model to account for these experimental observations. Our findings provide important insights into future applications of transition metal dichalcogenides in nanoelectronics, spintronics and photonics devices as they critically depend on the spin-orbit physics of these materials.

ABSTRACT: Using a finite-difference time-domain method, it has been shown that focal spots generated when tightly focusing a linearly polarized Gaussian beam by a Fresnel zone plate (FZP) and when focusing a Gaussian beam with an embedded optical vortex by a spiral zone plate (SZP) have different patterns of the intensity and energy flux. The most significant differences are observed when the value of the topological charge (TC) is equal to three. The energy flux has an annular distribution when the Gaussian beam is focused by the FZP, while the SZP produces a field whose patterns of intensity and energy flux have three local maxima. The number of local maxima corresponds to the order of the SZP. At a certain distance from the focus, the petal structure of the intensity (and energy flux) changes to a ring distribution.

Pa-3, a = 24.433 angstrom, and V = 14587.24 angstrom(3) is performed using the ToposPro software package. Metal precursor clusters of crystalline structures are determined using an algorithm for decomposing structural graphs into cluster structures and by constructing a basic grid of the structure in the form of a graph whose nodes correspond to the position of the centers of precursor clusters S-3(0). A total of 26 906 variants of the cluster representation of a 3D atomic mesh with the number of structural units ranging from 3 to 12 are established.

The symmetric and topological code of the processes of self-assembly of 3D structures from precursor clusters K155 and K55 is reconstructed as follows: primary chain. microlayer. microframework. Al atoms are established as spacers occupying voids in the 3D framework of the K155 and K55 nanoclusters.

ABSTRACT: We present a flexible method for measuring the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of a linearly polarized beam by means of a metasurface composed of a V-shaped gold plasmonic antenna. When a linearly polarized OAM light illuminates the metasurface, the ordinary beam with the same polarization and topological charge transmits forward, whereas another two extraordinary beams with the same topological charge but with cross polarization are tilted with respect to the ordinary beam. The topological charge of the OAM beam can be detected by the near-field interferogram of the two extraordinary beams. The metasurface is effective for detecting OAM transparently in a broadband wavelength and offers the capability of integration with fiber and on-chip devices.

ABSTRACT: We obtain a well-defined topological charge signature from the intensity correlation of two spatially incoherent Laguerre-Gauss beams of differing orders when each beam is diffracted by a triangle. We show that the value of the obtained topological charge follows a correlation rule such that its value is related to the topological charges associated to both incoherent beams. This paper suggests a way to measure an effective topological charge of the coherence function, and opens a new window for studies of correlation between different orders of optical vortex beams.

ABSTRACT: "Using computer methods (ToposPro software package), a combinatorial topological analysis and modeling of the self-assembly of the following crystal structures are carried out: Y20Cu20Mg64-oC104 (a = 4.136 & Aring , b = 19.239 & Aring , c = 29.086 & Aring , V = 2314.45 & Aring (3), Cmcm), Y20Cu20Mg52-oC92 (a = 4.097 & Aring , b = 19.279 & Aring , c = 25.790 & Aring , V = 2037.30 & Aring (3), Cmcm), and Y-3(NiAl3)Ge-2-hP9 (a = b = 6.948 & Aring , c = 4.156 & Aring , V = 173.78 5 & Aring (3), P-62m). For the Y20Cu20Mg64-oC104 crystal structure, 52 variants of the cluster representation of the 3D atomic network with the 3, 4, and 5 structural units are established. Four crystallographically independent structural units in the form of a tetrahedron are determined: tetrahedron K4 = 0@CuMg3, tetrahedron K4 = 0@YMg3, tetrahedron K4 = 0@YCuMg2, and a supratetrahedron K6 = 0@YCu2Mg3. A variant of self-assembly with the participation of hexamers from six linked structural units is considered (K4B+ K4C)(K4A+ K6)(K4B+ K4C). For the Y20Cu20Mg64-oC92 crystal structure, 27 variants of cluster representation of the 3D atomic mesh with 3, 4, and 5 structural units are established. Three crystallographically independent structural units in the form of a tetrahedron are determined: tetrahedron K4 = 0@YCuMg2, cluster K6 = 0@6(Y2Mg4) in the form of double tetrahedrons YMg3, and a nine-atom supratetrahedron K9 = Mg@Y2Cu2Mg4 consisting of two YMg2Cu and two YMg3 tetrahedrons. A variant of the self-assembly involving trimers of three structural units K4+ K6+ K9 is considered. For the Y-3(NiAl3)Ge-2-hP9 crystal structure, eight variants of decomposition of the 3D atomic mesh into cluster structures with the participation of two structural units are established. A variant of the self-assembly with the participation of packing generatrices of seven-atom clusters-precursors K7 = 0@Y-3(NiAl3) with the participation of Ge atoms-spacers is considered. The symmetry and topological code of the self-assembly processes of 3D-structures is reconstructed from clusters-precursor in the following form: primary chain -> layer -> framework."

ABSTRACT: Optical knots and links are nontrivial three-dimensional topologies consisting of trajectories of phase or polarisation singularities. They are theoretically predicted and experimentally observed in paraxial and nonparaxial regimes and in random and speckle fields. The topological nature of optical knots suggests that environmental disturbances should not alter their topology, hence becoming a resilient vector of information. However, the robustness of optical knots under typical disturbances encountered in optical experiments has not been investigated. Here, we provide the experimental analysis of the effects of optical phase aberrations on optical knots and links. We demonstrate that Hopf links, trefoil and cinquefoil knots are robust to misalignment and phase aberrations. The observed knots are obliterated for high aberration strengths and defining apertures close to the characteristic optical beam size. Our observations indicate these photonic topological structures as viable alternatives for both classical and quantum information processing noisy channels, where optical modes are not applicable. Optical knots are three-dimensional topologies made of singularities in phase or polarization, but the robustness of their topological structure under optical disturbances is still unexplored. The authors experimentally verify the robustness of optical knots to environmental disturbances, indicating them as a viable vector of information.

ABSTRACT: The method of the misfit dislocation removal from working area of the devices on heterostructures is theoretically offered. The chainlet of the edge dislocation (one-dimensional soliton-soliton bound state) is formed in substrate and film border by special preliminary processing. The stress field of such chainlet pushes away. misfit dislocation incipient on the borders of the heterostructures. By numerical experiment it is shown that the stress field of a chainlet is compressed in a sliding direction and it increases in a perpendicular direction, when the velocity is increased. It is possible to influence locally on the given dislocation varying the parameters of the system.

ABSTRACT: Higher-order orbital angular momentum (OAM) mode guiding in a waveguide which is suitable for on-chip integration has been investigated. Based on the relation between the Laguerre-Gaussian mode and the Hermite-Gaussian mode, it has been shown that two degenerate guided modes of pi/2l-rotation symmetry can support the l-th order OAM mode. In order to mimic the rotational symmetry, we have proposed the waveguide structure of a cross-shaped core and designed a waveguide that can support OAM modes of +/- 1 and +/- 2 topological charges simultaneously at a wavelength of 1550 nm. Purity of the OAM modes guided in the designed waveguide has been assessed by numerically calculating their topological charges from the field distribution, which were close to the theoretical values. We also investigated the guiding of OAM modes of +/- 3 and +/- 4 topological charges in our proposed waveguide structure, which revealed the possibility of the separate guiding of those OAM modes with relatively lower purity.

ABSTRACT: Wavelength switchable and dual-wavelength soliton operations are demonstrated in an erbium-doped fiber laser with three pieces of TI Bi2Se3 polyvinyl alcohol (Bi2Se3-PVA) film. Wavelength switchable operation from 1532 to 1557 nm could be achieved just by adjusting the pump power. With the appropriate settings of PC and pump power, a novel dual-wavelength soliton operation was observed. The dual-wavelength pulses operate at different mode-locked states. One is the single pulse mode-locking operation at 1532 nm, and the other one is the bound-soliton states at 1557 nm. However, the dual-wavelength soliton operation cannot be stable for a long time. The numerical results demonstrate that the separations of bound pulses have small variation and that the phase difference of bound pulses appear jumping change of pi.

ABSTRACT: Entanglement and topology portray nature at the fundamental level but differently. Entangled states of particles are intrinsically sensitive to the environment, whereas the topological phases of matter are naturally robust against environmental perturbations. Harnessing topology to protect entanglement has great potential for reliable quantum applications. Generating topologically protected entanglement, however, remains a significant challenge, requiring the operation of complex quantum devices in extreme conditions. Here we report topologically protected entanglement emitters that emit a topological Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen state and a multiphoton entangled state from a monolithically integrated plug-and-play silicon photonic chip in ambient conditions. The device emulating a photonic anomalous Floquet insulator allows the generation of four-photon topological entangled states at non-trivial edge modes, verified by the observation of a reduced de Broglie wavelength. Remarkably, we show that the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entanglement can be topologically protected against artificial structure defects by comparing the state fidelities of 0.968 +/- 0.004 and 0.951 +/- 0.010 for perfect and defected emitters, respectively. Our topologically protected devices may find applications in quantum computation and in the study of quantum topological physics. A photonic anomalous Floquet insulator is emulated in a silicon photonic chip. Up to four-photon topologically protected entangled states are generated in a monolithically integrated emitter in ambient conditions through four-wave mixing on top of the edge modes of the insulator.

ABSTRACT: Bound states in the continuum (BICs), manifesting themselves as the collapse of Fano resonance, are observed in many photonic and plasmonic systems. The BICs have been studied systematically through various methods such as the topological photonics analysis, temporal coupled mode theory, multipole decomposition method, and the cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED) method. Since CQED can give a macroscopic and intrinsic description of light-matter interaction, it is expected to study BIC that participates in strong coupling. What is more, the relation between coupling strength, the Fano parameter, and the asymmetry property of BICs needs to be clarified. In this paper, we investigated the strong coupling between the cavity mode and Bloch-surface plasmon polariton (Bloch-SPP) mode induced by BICs within the plasmonic lattices of the metal-dielectric-metal (MDM) layer. The properties of strong coupling and BIC were revealed theoretically by the quantum model based on the CQED. The increase in the Fano parameters of BICs was proved to facilitate the coupling strength, which was indicated by the monotonically increasing relation between the Fano parameter and the coupling strength. This work may pave the way for flexible modulation and application of BIC in the fields of high-quality plasmonic nanocavity, low-threshold nano-lasers, and quantum information.

ABSTRACT: All elementary particles in nature can be classified as fermions with half-integer spin and bosons with integer spin. Within quantum electrodynamics (QED), even though the spin of the Dirac particle is well defined, there exist open questions on the quantized description of spin of the gauge field particle-the photon. Using quantum field theory, we discover the quantum operators for the spin angular momentum (SAM) S-M = (1/c) integral d(3)x pi x A and orbital angular momentum (OAM) L-M = -(1/c) f d(3)x pi(mu)x x del A(mu) of the photon, where pi(mu) is the conjugate canonical momentum of the gauge field A(mu). We also reveal a perfect symmetry between the angular momentum commutation relations for Dirac fields and Maxwell fields. We derive the well-known OAM and SAM of classical electromagnetic fields from the above-defined quantum operators. Our work shows that the spin and OAM operators commute, which is important for simultaneously observing and separating the SAM and OAM. The correct commutation relations of orbital and spin angular momentum of the photon has applications in quantum optics, topological photonics as well as nanophotonics and can be extended in the future for the spin structure of nucleons.

ABSTRACT: Terahertz (THz) photonics is a key-enabling technology for a wealth of urgently demanding applications and societal challenges like ultrahigh speed communication systems, medical imaging and diagnostics, industrial and food quality control, and security screening. Therefore, making novel THz materials, that are able to effectively interact and manipulate THz radiation, is a challenge in this respect. Dirac materials that are endowed with linearly dispersed electronic bands, are a promising frontier in this framework as they are suited to generate plasmon resonances in the THz regime. Dirac materials include the well-known cases of graphene and three dimensional topological insulators. In perspective they can be extended to new emerging materials including graphene-like Xenes (from silicene to bismuthene) and Weyl/Dirac semimetals. In addition to the materials aspects, in this perspective review we deliberately single out an easy framework where to validate Dirac materials for THz applications. This one includes the optical conductivity deduced by THz spectroscopy as a good figure of merit, and the micro-ribbon pattern as a good plasmonic grating. In the end, we outline future challenges and current bottlenecks in the production and exploitation of Dirac materials in the THz technology. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Nonreciprocal optical devices have broad applications in light manipulations for communications and sensing. Non-magnetic mechanisms of optical nonreciprocity are highly desired for high-frequency on-chip applications. Here, we investigate the nonreciprocal properties of light propagation in a dielectric waveguide induced by a subwavelength spinning cylinder. We find that the chiral modes of the cylinder can give rise to unidirectional coupling with the waveguide via the transverse spin-orbit interaction, leading to different transmissions for guided wave propagating in opposite directions and thus optical isolation. We reveal the dependence of the nonreciprocal properties on various system parameters including mode order, spinning speed, coupling distance, and various losses. The results show that higher-order chiral modes and larger spinning speed generally give rise to stronger nonreciprocity, and there exists an optimal cylinder-waveguide coupling distance where the optical isolation reaches the maximum. The properties are sensitive to the material loss of the cylinder but show robustness against surface-roughness-induced loss in the waveguide. Our work contributes to the understanding of nonreciprocity in subwavelength moving structures and can find applications in integrated photonic circuits, topological photonics, and novel metasurfaces.

ABSTRACT: Thanks to progress in material science and nanotechnologies, surfaces and thin films can now be structured at different scales. Photonics components take advantage of this possibility to fulfill still more and more complex functions. They are composed of organic and inorganic materials, dielectrics, semiconductors, and metallic materials, or a mixture of them. Multiscale and chiral structures can be used to control both spectral and spatial distributions of light together with its polarization state. The optical mode density in the near field and in the far field can then be designed in particular by combining more or less resonant structures for the optical waves, associating diffraction, interferences, and anisotropic structures like Fabry-Perot, waveguide, plasmons, and photonic crystals. Artificially nanostructured materials, often called metamaterials, exhibit new properties. Different phenomena, including optical topological insulator and structures for vortex waves transporting angular momentum of photons, are discussed and illustrated. With the development of nanometer size structures, another step is taken toward allowing control of the intimate interaction of optical waves with materials to tune their basic electronic properties and permittivity. Both optical and electronic properties are also strongly dependent on coupling effects and need a global approach. (C) 2015 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

ABSTRACT: Recently emerged metasurfaces, the two-dimensional (2D) counterpart of three dimensional (3D) metamaterials, gained significant attention in optics and photonics due to their less challenging fabrication requirements (compared to 3D metamaterials) and unique capabilities of wavefront manipulation by introducing abrupt phase shift. Realization of multiple functionalities in a single metasurface, is an intriguing perception to achieve further miniaturization and cost effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a polarization insensitive, highly efficient metasurfaces for the visible spectrum. For the design wavelength of 633nm, negligible absorption coefficient (k) and adequately large refractive index (n) of proposed hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si: H) leads to considerably efficient and cost-effective solution towards metasurfaces design. Inherent property of cylindrical pillar to be polarization insensitive is exploited and 400 nm thick cylindrical nano-waveguide is opted as building block to construct the metasurface. A novel design strategy of achieving multiple functionalities from a single metasurface is proposed, where a combined effect of lensing and optical vortices with different topological charges at different focal planes is demonstrated for the proof of concept. Such unique design strategy of integrating multiple phases into a single device provides an innovative way of miniaturizing the optical devices and systems exhibiting versatile functionalities for on-chip applications.

ABSTRACT: In contrast to artificial metamaterials, natural two-dimensional (2D) hyperbolic materials are able to support higher electromagnetic confinement and stronger photonic density of states. This means natural 2D hyperbolic materials have fascinating potential for applications in thermal photonics. In this work, we investigate mechanisms of near-field thermal radiation (NFTR) in a T-d-WTe2 single layer at the nanoscale using the fluctuation-dissipation theorem and density-functional theory. The results show that NFTR of T-d-WTe2 can be 3 orders of magnitude larger than the blackbody limit. By using the photonic tunnel -ing coefficient and the plasmon dispersion, we present a comprehensive study of plasmonic properties of T-d-WTe2. Moreover, our first-principles calculations predict that application of a certain amount of mechanical stress can trigger topological transition between the elliptic and the hyperbolic surface states by regulating the Fermi surface and interband excitation threshold. Lastly, we systematically exhibit the evolution of surface plasmon polaritons in T-d-WTe2 under mechanical stress and analyze the performance of using mechanical stress to modulate the corresponding NFTR. Our work explores the great potential of tunable radiative heat flux in T-d-WTe2, which is explained here through the peculiar nature of hyperbolic surface plasmons.

ABSTRACT: Graphene and its bilayer structure are the two- dimensional crystalline form of carbon, whose extraordinary electron mobility and other unique features hold great promise for nanoscale electronics and photonics. Their realistic applications in emerging nanoelectronics usually call for thermal transport manipulation in a controllable and precise manner. In this paper we systematically studied the effect of interlayer covalent bonding, in particular different interlay bonding arrangement, on the thermal conductivity of bilayer graphene using equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. It is revealed that, the thermal conductivity of randomly bonded bilayer graphene decreases monotonically with the increase of interlayer bonding density, however, for the regularly bonded bilayer graphene structure the thermal conductivity possesses unexpectedly non-monotonic dependence on the interlayer bonding density. The results suggest that the thermal conductivity of bilayer graphene depends not only on the interlayer bonding density, but also on the detailed topological configuration of the interlayer bonding. The underlying mechanism for this abnormal phenomenon is identified by means of phonon spectral energy density, participation ratio and mode weight factor analysis. The large tunability of thermal conductivity of bilayer graphene through rational interlayer bonding arrangement paves the way to achieve other desired properties for potential nanoelectronics applications involving graphene layers.

ABSTRACT: Emergent technologies that make use of novel materials and quantum properties of light states are at the forefront in the race for the physical implementation, encoding and transmission of information. Photonic crystals (PCs) enter this paradigm with optical materials that allow the control of light propagation and can be used for optical communication, and photonics and electronics integration, making use of materials ranging from semiconductors, to metals, metamaterials, and topological insulators, to mention but a few. Here, we show how designer superconductor materials integrated into PCs fabrication allow for an extraordinary reduction of electromagnetic waves damping, making possible their optimal propagation and tuning through the structure, below critical superconductor temperature. We experimentally demonstrate, for the first time, a successful integration of ferroelectric and superconductor materials into a one-dimensional (1D) PC composed of (BTO/YBCO)N/STO bilayers that work in the whole visible spectrum, and below (and above) critical superconductor temperature TC=80 mml:mspace width=0.166667emmml:mspace K. Theoretical calculations support, for different number of bilayers N, the effectiveness of the produced 1D PCs and may pave the way for novel optoelectronics integration and information processing in the visible spectrum, while preserving their electric and optical properties.

ABSTRACT: Due to the topological charge-independent doughnut spatial structure as well as the association of orbital angular momentums, perfect vortex beams promise significant advances in fiber communication, optical manipulation and quantum optics. Inspired by the development of planar photonics, several plasmonic and dielectric metasurfaces have been constructed to generate perfect vortex beams, instead of conventional bulky configuration. However, owing to the intrinsic Ohmic losses and interband electron transitions in materials, these metasurface-based vortex beam generators only work at optical frequencies up to the visible range. Herein, using silicon nitride nanopillars as high-efficiency half-wave plates, broadband and high-performance metasurfaces are designed and demonstrated numerically to directly produce perfect vortex beams in the ultraviolet region, by combining the phase profiles of spiral phase plate, axicon and Fourier transformation lens based on geometric phase. The conversion efficiency of the metasurface is up to 86.6% at the design wavelength. Moreover, the influence of several control parameters on perfect vortex beam structures is discussed. We believe that this ultraviolet dielectric generator of perfect vortex beams will find many significant applications, such as high-resolution spectroscopy, optical tweezer and on-chip communication.

ABSTRACT: Structured light refers to the ability to tailor optical patterns in all its degrees of freedom, from conventional 2D transverse patterns to exotic forms of 3D, 4D, and even higher-dimensional modes of light, which break fundamental paradigms and open new and exciting applications for both classical and quantum scenarios. The description of diverse degrees of freedom of light can be based on different interpretations, e.g. rays, waves, and quantum states, that are based on different assumptions and approximations. In particular, recent advances highlighted the exploiting of geometric transformation under general symmetry to reveal the 'hidden' degrees of freedom of light, allowing access to higher dimensional control of light. In this tutorial, I outline the basics of symmetry and geometry to describe light, starting from the basic mathematics and physics of SU(2) symmetry group, and then to the generation of complex states of light, leading to a deeper understanding of structured light with connections between rays and waves, quantum and classical. The recent explosion of related applications are reviewed, including advances in multi-particle optical tweezing, novel forms of topological photonics, high-capacity classical and quantum communications, and many others, that, finally, outline what the future might hold for this rapidly evolving field.

ABSTRACT: Twisted strips, known for Mobius strips, are threedimensional (3D) topological structures describing how a surface can be twisted in space. The spatial configuration can be readily demonstrated using a rectangular strip of paper and is well constructed as liquid crystal defect and optical microcavity structures. Here, we use a spatiotemporal light field based on the toroidal vortex to show that the dynamic phase structure can form topological objects with controllable twists number. The structured light field makes full use of the degree of freedom of the high-dimensional parameter space and establishes the connection between optical strips, optical knots, and optical Hopfions. The preparation of such topological structured light may provide new insight for the complex singular optics and find applications in high-dimensional information encoding.

ABSTRACT: The tight focusing of an optical vortex with an integer topological charge (TC) and linear polarization was considered. We showed that the longitudinal components of the spin angular momentum (SAM) (it was equal to zero) and orbital angular momentum (OAM) (it was equal to the product of the beam power and the TC) vectors averaged over the beam cross-section were separately preserved during the beam propagation. This conservation led to the spin and orbital Hall effects. The spin Hall effect was expressed in the fact that the areas with different signs of the SAM longitudinal component were separated from each other. The orbital Hall effect was marked by the separation of the regions with different rotation directions of the transverse energy flow (clockwise and counterclockwise). There were only four such local regions near the optical axis for any TC. We showed that the total energy flux crossing the focus plane was less than the total beam power since part of the power propagated along the focus surface, while the other part crossed the focus plane in the opposite direction. We also showed that the longitudinal component of the angular momentum (AM) vector was not equal to the sum of the SAM and the OAM. Moreover, there was no summand SAM in the expression for the density of the AM. These quantities were independent of each other. The distributions of the AM and the SAM longitudinal components characterized the orbital and spin Hall effects at the focus, respectively.

ABSTRACT: Spin-Hall effect (SHE) of light is one of the main manifestations of the spin-orbit interaction of photons, and has been extensively studied for optical beams with homogeneous polarization. Here, we present a theoretical study of the SHE of cylindrical vector vortex beams (CVVBs) possessing inhomogeneous polarization. We derive the analytical expressions of the SHE of CVVBs reflected and refracted at a dielectric interface with radial and azimuthal polarization of incidence. The spin-dependent shifts of the SHE of light linearly depend on the topological charge of the CVVBs. In contrast to the conventional SHE of horizontally or vertically polarized beams, the SHE shifts of the CVVBs are asymmetrical when the topological charge is nonzero. This asymmetry results in the transverse Imbert-Fedorov (IF) shifts that are proportional to the topological charge. Furthermore, based on weak measurement, we propose an experimental scheme to enhance the SHE and related IF shifts with proper pre- and post-selection polarization states. Our results advance the study of the SHE of structured light and may find applications in SHE-based techniques such as precision measurement.

ABSTRACT: We report on intra- and inter-modal four-wave-mixing (FWM) in N-fold rotationally symmetric (C-N) single- and multi-core chiral photonic crystal fiber (PCF), created by spinning the preform during fiber drawing. The non-circular modal field is forced to rotate as it propagates along the fiber, resulting in circular birefringence and robust maintenance of circular polarization state. Multi-core chiral C-N PCF supports vortex-carrying helical Bloch modes (HBMs) in which the degeneracy between clockwise and counter-clockwise vortices is lifted. This makes possible new kinds of intermodal polarization modulational instability (PMI). We develop PMI theory for vortex HBMs, and illustrate the results by a series of experiments in which two or more PMI sidebands with different vorticities and polarization states are selectively generated by adjusting the polarization state and topological charge of the pump light. In every case both the topological charge and the spin of the pump light are conserved. We also report generation of a broadband supercontinuum in a single circularly polarized vortex mode.

ABSTRACT: Narrow-bandgap materials possess the intriguing optical-electric properties and unique structures, which can be widely applied in the field of photonics, energy optoelectronic sensing and biomedicine, etc. Nowadays, the researches on nonlinear optical properties of narrow-bandgap materials have attracted extensive attention worldwide. In this paper, we review the progress of narrow-bandgap materials from many aspects, such as background, nonlinear optical properties, energy band structure, methods of preparation, and applications. These materials have obvious nonlinear optical characteristics and the interaction with the short pulse laser excitation shows the extremely strong nonlinear absorption characteristics, which leads to the optical limiting or saturable absorption related to Pauli blocking and excited state absorption. Especially, some of these novel narrow-bandgap materials have been utilized for the generation of ultrashort pulse that covers the range from the visible to mid-infrared wavelength regions. Hence, the study on these materials paves a new way for the advancement of optoelctronics devices.

ABSTRACT: In addition to enhancing confinement, restricting optical systems to two dimensions gives rise to new photonic states, modified transport and distinct nonlinear effects. Here we explore these properties in combination and experimentally demonstrate a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition in a nonlinear photonic lattice. In this topological transition, vortices are created in pairs and then unbind, changing the dynamics from that of a photonic fluid to that of a plasma-like gas of free (topological) charges. We explicitly measure the number and correlation properties of free vortices, for both repulsive and attractive interactions (the photonic equivalent of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic conditions), and confirm the traditional thermodynamics of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. We also suggest a purely fluid interpretation, in which vortices are nucleated by inhomogeneous flow and driven by seeded instability. The results are fundamental to optical hydrodynamics and can impact two-dimensional photonic devices if temperature and interactions are not controlled properly. A topological transition in a nonlinear photonic lattice results in new vortex dynamics and a change from photonic fluid behaviour to that of a plasma-like gas.

ABSTRACT: Recently, electromagnetic (EM) beams with the orbital angular momentum (OAM) have been explored for multiplexing in communication systems. Each OAM mode is encoded with data and can be identified by the OAM index, namely the topological charge. So far, the amplitude of OAM mode is gaining more attention for its application as another modulation format. Therefore, it is of great importance to accurately extract both the OAM index and corresponding amplitude. In this paper, we propose a modified dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) approach for the analysis of OAM modes. It is shown that not only topological charges but also high-resolution amplitude patterns of both single OAM mode and composite OAM modes can be obtained. The proposed approach provides an effective tool for the demultiplexing of OAM-carrying beams, especially in the case when the amplitude information is required.

ABSTRACT: Since the seminal work by J. H. Poynting, light has been known to carry momentum and angular momentum. The typical dynamical features of light and its interactions-termed spin-orbit interactions (SOIs), which have been investigated intensely over the last 30 years-play a crucial role in various light-matter interactions, for example: spin Hall effect, spin-orbit conversion, helicity-controlled unidirectional excitation of light, and their inverse effects, which leads to plenty of applications including optical manipulation, communications, imaging, sensing, nanometrology, on-chip optoelectronic technologies and interdisciplinary researches. In particular, the SOI of light in isotropic inhomogeneous media is a fine, subwavelength effect accomplished through the intrinsic coupling between light's phase, polarization and position. Therefore, the traditional methods of near-field measurements, such as near field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM), have been widely employed to reveal the optical SOIs intuitively by measuring the intensity of light. Very recently, with modern advanced nanofabrication techniques, many measurement techniques based on nanoparticles, nanoantennas, and nanoprobes of special designs have been proposed to understand the optical SOIs visually by characterizing the polarization and spin/orbital features of light. This endeavor has led to the development of chiral quantum optics, spin optics, and topological photonics, and resulted in novel applications requiring optical manipulations and angular momentum communications, chiral imaging, nanometrology, and robust spin-based devices and techniques for quantum technologies. Here, we review the near-field techniques for measurements of optical SOIs together with their potential applications. We start with a theoretical overview of momentum and angular momentum properties of generic optical fields and typical phenomena involving optical SOIs. Then, we overview the theoretical basis and latest achievements of the near-field measurement techniques, including NSOM, optical manipulations, nanoantenna, and nanoprobes of special designs, all relevant to optical SOIs. A comprehensive classification is then constructed of all known methods of optical near-field measurements for the SOI of light and novel techniques identified for future applications.

ABSTRACT: Artificial gauge fields the control over the dynamics of uncharged particles by engineering the potential landscape such that the particles behave as if effective external fields are acting on them. Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in artificial gauge fields generated either by the geometry or by time-dependent modulation, as they have been enablers of topological phenomena and synthetic dimensions in many physical settings, e.g., photonics, cold atoms, and acoustic waves. Here, we formulate and experimentally demonstrate the generalized laws of refraction and reflection at an interface between two regions with different artificial gauge fields. We use the symmetries in the system to obtain the generalized Snell law for such a gauge interface and solve for reflection and transmission. We identify total internal reflection (TIR) and complete transmission and demonstrate the concept in experiments. In addition, we calculate the artificial magnetic flux at the interface of two regions with different artificial gauge fields and present a method to concatenate several gauge interfaces. As an example, we propose a scheme to make a gauge imaging system-a device that can reconstruct (image) the shape of an arbitrary wavepacket launched from a certain position to a predesigned location. Photonics: Manipulating light with artificial fieldsArtificial gauge fields are a technique to engineer the potential landscape such that neutral particles mimic the dynamics of charged particles driven by external fields. Researchers in Israel and Germany, led by Mordechai Segev at Technion Israel Institute of Technology, and Georg von Freymann from the University of Kaiserslautern, Germany, and their students Moshe-Ishay Cohen and Christina Joerg, studied theoretically and experimentally what happens when waves are incident at the interface between two photonic systems made from the same material, with the only thing making them different being their artificial gauge fields. The team formulated the generalized laws of refraction and reflection at such gauge interfaces, and demonstrated the concepts with micro-printed waveguides arrays with different tilt angles. The research demonstrates that several interfaces between regions with differing gauge fields could be used to develop novel photonic devices.

ABSTRACT: We resonantly excite exciton-polariton states confined in cylindrical traps. Using a homodyne detection setup, we are able to image the phase and amplitude of the confined polariton states. We evidence the excitation of vortex states, carrying an integer angular orbital momentum m, analogous to the transverse TEM01* donut mode of cylindrically symmetric optical resonators. Tuning the excitation conditions allows us to select the charge of the vortex. In this way, the injection of singly charged (m=1 and m=-1) and doubly charged (m=2) polariton vortices is shown. This work demonstrates the potential of in-plane confinement coupled with selective excitation for the topological tailoring of polariton wave functions.

ABSTRACT: Using computer methods (ToposPro software package), geometrical and topological analysis of the crystal structure of Na52Ba4Sn80-cF540 intermetallic compound (a = 25.053 angstrom, V = 16 010.82 angstrom(3), space group F-43m) are carried out. Two new nanocluster precursors with the -43m symmetry are determined, more specifically, the K47 two-layer nanocluster of the Na@16Sn@30Na composition with an NaSn16 internal Friauf polyhedron and 30 Na atoms in the shell and a K64 two-layer nanocluster of the 0@8(Sn4Ba4)@56(Na4Sn52) composition with the Sn4Ba4 internal polyhedron and 56 (4Na + 52Sn) atoms in the shell. The symmetrical and topological codes of self-assembly processes of 3D structures from K64 and K47 cluster precursors are reconstructed in the following form: primary chain -> microlayer -> microframework. The Na-4 and Sn-8 clusters with the -43m symmetry and Na atoms are determined as the spacers occupying the voids in the 3D framework from the K64 and K47 nanoclusters.

The symmetrical and topological code of the self-assembly of the 3D Na12K52Tl36In122 structure from the precursor K132 and K116 nanoclusters is reconstructed in the following form: primary chain -> layer -> frame. The framework's voids are occupied by spacer atoms K and Tl.

ABSTRACT: As an emerging group of two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials, 2D group-VA layered nanomaterials have been attracting increasing attention in recent years due to their intriguing physiochemical properties and functional structures for broad and promising applications. In contrast to phosphorene and black phosphorus, 2D group-VA pnictogen elemental (As, Sb, and Bi) nanomaterials have tunable direct bandgaps, high stability, charge-carrier mobility and unique in-plane anisotropic structures, giving them great prospects for applications in significant and extensive research areas. In this review, we systematically introduced the recent advances in 2D group-VA nanomaterials beyond black phosphorus. First, the synthesis methods were summarized and grouped into top-down and bottom-up categories. Then, their fundamental properties were described, referring to their band structures and carrier transport as well as mechanical, thermal, optical, magnetic and electronic properties. Subsequently, functional nanostructures were discussed, such as heterostructures, doping, absorption, pnictogen-containing hybrids and surface functionalization. Finally, potential applications were illustrated, involving catalysis, energy storage, field-effect transistors, topological spintronic devices, electronic devices, nonlinear photonics, light-emitting devices, gas sensors, thermoelectric materials and biomedicine. Finally, the current states, challenges and perspectives for the emerging 2D group-VA nanomaterials were discussed rationally. This timely and comprehensive review is attractive for scientists from different research fields and promotes the further development of low-dimensional nanomaterials and functionalized hybrid materials.

ABSTRACT: Amphiphilic brush block copolymers (BBCPs) have demonstrated interesting self-assembly behaviors different from their coil-like linear analogues, and their rigid molecular conformation make it straightforward to fabricate ordered nanostructured materials useful in many important applications such as photonics, therapeutics, etc. However, influence of side chain topology on self-assembled nanostructures as well as physical properties remained unclear due to the lack of amphiphilic BBCPs bearing different topological side chains. Herein, we successfully synthesize a group of novel amphiphilic BBCPs with wedge-like dendritic side chains, i.e., lipophilic benzyl ether (Bn) and hydrophilic triethylene glycol (TEG). Firstly, two generations of norbornene-terminated macromonomers are obtained by esterification, nucleophilic substitution, imidization reactions, etc. Secondly, dendronized BBCPs bearing two generations of side chains are prepared through sequential ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP). Chemical structures of the obtained BBCPs are clearly characterized using proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1-NMR). Absolute molecular weights are determined using gel permeation chromatography (GPC) equipped with a multi-angle laser scattering detector (MALS), and single GPC peaks as well as small polydispersity indices (PDI<1.20) indicate a constant number of catalytic centers during the polymerization process. Weight average molecular weight are tunable from 164 kDa to 431 kDa by varying the feed ratio of monomer to catalyst. Moreover, side chain effect on molecular conformation in solution is investigated using GPC-MALS. Random coil conformation is observed for the first-generation polymers as indicated by the small slope values of linearly fitted lines in double-logarithmic plots of radii of gyration versus molecular weight, while the second-generation polymers with larger side chains exhibit a rod-like molecular conformation, which are further confirmed using atom force microscopy (AFM). This work provides a highly efficient synthetic route to amphiphilic dendronized BBCPs with precisely tailored topological side chains and molecular conformations, which enables the fabrication of novel nanostructured polymer materials with diverse physical properties for different applications.

ABSTRACT: A combinatorial topological analysis and modeling of the self-assembly of crystal structures of LiCaSn-hP9 (space group P3m1, V = 230.36 angstrom(3)), Li2CaSn- cF16 (space group Fm-3m, V = 333.56 angstrom(3)), and Li20Ca28Sn44-oS92 (space group Cmcm, V = 2517.09 angstrom(3)) are performed using computer methods (ToposPro software package). The cyclic precursor clusters K3-0@LiCaSn involved in the self-assembly of the crystal structure of LiCaSn-hP9, as well as tetrahedral ones K4 for the crystal structure of Li2CaSn-cF16 and cyclic K3, tetrahedral K4, and pentagonal pyramids K6 for the crystal structure of Li20Ca28Sn44-oS92, are established. The self-assembly of the crystal structure of Li20Ca28Sn44-oS92, are established. The self-assembly of the crystal structure of Li20Ca28Sn44-oS92 involves S-3(1)(A) primary chains from the bound clusters K6 and K3, and S-3(1)(B) primary chains from the bound clusters K4 and K3. In the 2D layer, an chain with m symmetry is bound to the S-3(1)(B) chains on both sides. The framework S-3(3) structure is formed by binding 2D layers in the direction [100], whereas the distance between the equivalent 2D layers determines the value of vector a = 4.666 angstrom. The S1/3 primary chain of the intermetallic compound Li2CaSn-cF16 is formed as a result of the binding of tetrahedral metal clusters Li2CaSn with the binding index P = 8. The formation of the S3/2 layer occurs by binding parallel chains with the index P = 10. The distance between the axes of the primary chains from neighboring layers in the direction of axes X and Y corresponds to the value of the parameters of the cubic cell a = b = 6.935 angstrom. The S1/3 primary chain of the intermetallic compound LiCaSn-hP9 is formed as a result of the binding of the cyclic LiCaSn metal clusters with the binding index P = 4 and 5. The S2/3 layer is formed by binding parallel chains with the binding index P = 10. The distance between the axes of the primary chains corresponds to the value of the parameter of the hexagonal cell a = 4.94 angstrom.

ABSTRACT: Transformation optics (TO) has established itself as a powerful and versatile approach to the synthesis of metamaterials with prescribed field-manipulation capabilities, via suitable spatial modulation of their constitutive properties inspired by local distortions of the spatial coordinate reference frame. From the mathematical viewpoint, this approach can be reformulated in the frequency-wavenumber reciprocal phase space so as to engineer nonlocal interactions and spatial dispersion effects, which are becoming increasingly relevant in electrodynamics and optics. Here, we present a general nonlocal-TO framework, based on complex-valued, frequency-dependent wavenumber coordinate transformations, and explore its possible applications to scenarios of interest for dispersion engineering. A key attribute of our approach, similar to conventional TO, is the separation of the conceptual design (based on intuitive geometrical considerations) from the actual metamaterial synthesis (based on a suitable approximation of analytically derived constitutive blueprints). To illustrate the capabilities and potential of the proposed approach, we address the engineering (from the conceptual design to the actual synthesis) of multilayered metamaterials exhibiting various exotic dispersion effects, including one-way (nonreciprocal) propagation, frozen-mode regime, and Dirac-point conical singularities. Our approach may open up new perspectives in the systematic design of metamaterials with broad field-manipulation capabilities as well as complex spatiotemporal dispersion effects, with potential applications to nonreciprocal optics, topological photonics, and computational metamaterials.

ABSTRACT: A main objective of topological photonics is the design of disorder-resilient optical devices. Many prospective applications would benefit from nonlinear effects, which not only are naturally present in real systems but also are needed for switching in computational processes, while the underlying particle interactions are a key ingredient for the manifestation of genuine quantum effects. A particularly attractive switching mechanism of dynamical systems are infinite-period bifurcations into limit cycles, as these set on with a finite amplitude. Here we describe how to realize this switching mechanism by combining attractive and repulsive particle interactions in a driven-dissipative Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, such as realized in excitonic lasers and condensates so that the system displays a non-Hermitian combination of parity and charge-conjugation (PC) symmetry. We show that this symmetry survives in the nonlinear case and induces infinite-period and limit-cycle bifurcations (distinct from a Hopf bifurcation) where the system switches from a symmetry-breaking stationary state into a symmetry-protected power-oscillating state of finite amplitude. These protected dynamical solutions display a number of characteristic features, among which are their finite amplitude at onset, their arbitrary long oscillation period close to threshold, and the symmetry of their frequency spectrum which provides a tuneable frequency comb. Phases with different transition scenarios are separated by exceptional points in the stability spectrum, involving nonhermitian degeneracies of symmetry-protected excitations.

ABSTRACT: Inspired by advances in photonics, band structures have been used to investigate the wave behavior along phononic structures as well as their singular properties such as band gaps, defects and topological modes. The most commonly used method for computing band structures is the plane wave expansion, but it cannot be used to compute the forced response of a finite structure with boundary conditions and applied loads. To obtain such dynamic response, it is usually necessary to employ a full finite element model of the whole structure or spectral models that take advantage of the periodicity. This paper proposes a new spectral approach, based on a Riccati differential equation with the impedance as variable, to compute the transfer matrix of one-dimensional phononic systems with arbitrary geometric and material profiles. With this formulation, not only the complex band structure can be computed, but also the forced response. Results for ducts, rods and beams are presented and validated with the extended plane wave expansion and scaled spectral element methods. The proposed approach can also be applied to any one-dimensional periodic structures such as Levy plates, cylindrical shells and photonic systems. It can also be used to investigate with high accuracy and efficient computational cost the physical behavior of generic structures with non-slowly varying properties, gradient-index systems and cloaking devices.

ABSTRACT: Crystals are ubiquitous in nature and are at the heart of material research, solid-state science, and quantum physics. Unfortunately, the controllability of solid-state crystals is limited by the complexity of many-body dynamics and the presence of defects. In contrast, synthetic crystal structures, realized by, e.g., optical lattices, have recently enabled the investigation of various physical processes in a controllable manner, and even the study of new phenomena. Past realizations of synthetic optical crystals were, however, limited in size and dimensionality. Here we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate optical frequency crystal of arbitrary dimensions, formed by hundreds of coupled spectral modes within an on-chip electro-optic frequency comb. We show a direct link between the measured optical transmission spectrum and the density of states of frequency crystals in one, two, three, and four dimensions, with no restrictions to further expanding the dimensionality. We demonstrate that the generation of classical electro-optic frequency comb can be modeled as a process described by random walks in a tight-binding model, and we have verified this by measuring the coherent distribution of optical steady states. We believe that our platform is a promising candidate for exploration of topological and quantum photonics in the frequency domain.

ABSTRACT: We show frequency domain mirrors that provide reflections of optical mode propagation in the frequency domain. We theoretically investigated the mirror properties and experimentally demonstrate it using polarization and coupled-resonator-based coupling on thin film Lithium Niobate. Mirrors are ubiquitous in optics and are used to control the propagation of optical signals in space. Here we propose and demonstrate frequency domain mirrors that provide reflections of the optical energy in a frequency synthetic dimension, using electro-optic modulation. First, we theoretically explore the concept of frequency mirrors with the investigation of propagation loss, and reflectivity in the frequency domain. Next, we explore the mirror formed through polarization mode-splitting in a thin-film lithium niobate micro-resonator. By exciting the Bloch waves of the synthetic frequency crystal with different wave vectors, we show various states formed by the interference between forward propagating and reflected waves. Finally, we expand on this idea, and generate tunable frequency mirrors as well as demonstrate trapped states formed by these mirrors using coupled lithium niobate micro-resonators. The ability to control the flow of light in the frequency domain could enable a wide range of applications, including the study of random walks, boson sampling, frequency comb sources, optical computation, and topological photonics. Furthermore, demonstration of optical elements such as cavities, lasers, and photonic crystals in the frequency domain, may be possible.

ABSTRACT: Owing to a high electromagnetic confinement and a strong photonic density of states, hyperbolic surface plasmon polaritons (HSPPs) provide a fascinating promise for applications in thermal photonics. In this work, we theoretically predict a possibility for the improvement of the near -field radiative heat transfer on the basis of tailoring the electromagnetic state of hyperbolic metasurfaces by the uniaxial hyperbolic substrate. By using the photonic tunneling coefficient and the polaritons dispersion, we present a comprehensive study of the hybrid effect of the hyperbolic substrate on HSPPs. We find that due to the hybrid effect of the hyperbolic substrate, the anisotropy surface state of hyperbolic metasurfaces would undergo significant deformations and even topological transition. Moreover, we systematically exhibit the evolution of such hybrid hyperbolic mode with different thicknesses of the hyperbolic substrate and analyze the thickness effect on radiative properties of the hybrid system. It is shown that the resulting heat transfer with the assistance of the hybrid hyperbolic mode by optimizing the substrate parameters is many times stronger than that of monolayer hyperbolic metasurface at the same vacuum gap. Taken together, our results provide a platform to tailor 2D hyperbolic plasmons as a potential strategy toward passive or active control of the near -field heat transfer, and the hybrid hyperbolic mode presented here may facilitate the system design for near -field energy harvesting, thermal imaging, and radiative cooling applications.

ABSTRACT: Following the emergence of many novel two-dimensional (2D) materials beyond graphene, interest has grown in exploring implications for fundamental physics and practical applications ranging from electronics, photonics, and phononics to thermal management and energy storage. In this Colloquium, a summary and comparison are given of the phonon properties, such as phonon dispersion and relaxation time, of pristine 2D materials with single-layer graphene to understand the role of crystal structure and dimension on thermal conductivity. A comparison is made of the phonon properties, contrasting idealized 2D crystals, realistic 2D crystals, and 3D crystals, and synthesizing this to develop a physical picture of how the sample size of 2D materials affects their thermal conductivity. The effects of geometry such as the number of layers and the nanoribbon width, together with the presence of defects, mechanical strain, and substrate interactions on the thermal properties of 2D materials are discussed. Intercalation affects both the group velocities and phonon relaxation times of layered crystals and thus tunes the thermal conductivity along both the through-plane and basal-plane directions. This Colloquium concludes with a discussion of the challenges in theoretical and experimental studies of thermal transport in 2D materials. The rich and special phonon physics in 2D materials make them promising candidates for exploring novel phenomena such as topological phonon effects and applications such as phononic quantum devices.

ABSTRACT: The lack of transmissive photonic components in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) constitutes a challenge for micro/nano-metric confinement. Here, we theoretically design a novel approach to attain XUV radiation guidance based on the electromagnetic properties of titanium-aluminum-titanium heterostructures in such a spectral domain. We show that, thanks to the near-zero-index properties of aluminum and titanium, XUV radiation can couple efficiently with plasma oscillations in such heterostructures, enabling the excitation of several distinct plasmon polariton modes. Our predictions, based on the semi-analytical solution of fully vectorial Maxwell's equations, indicate that the dispersion profile of plasmon polariton modes can get efficiently modulated by the aluminum thickness, enabling nanometer confinement and micrometre propagation length. Moreover, we quantify the third-order nonlinearity enhancement factor, finding that it is resonant at the zero-index wavelength. Our results are promising for the development of future devices enabling advanced control and manipulation of XUV radiation.

ABSTRACT: Strained alpha-Sn thin films and stanene (two-dimensional counterpart of alpha-Sn), which have attracted significant attentions due to their electronic properties as topological insulators, were mostly deposited on nearly lattice-matched substrates through molecular beam epitaxy. In this work, contrary to prior efforts, Sn thin films are deposited on highly lattice-mismatched Ge (100) substrates through physical vapor deposition of solid Sn sources. Three different methods, 1) Acetone/Isopropyl Alcohol (IPA), 2) Acetone/IPA/H2O(80 degrees C), and 3) Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2)/Hydrochloric Acid (HCl), are used to clean commercially available Ge (100) substrates. X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterizations indicate that compressively strained alpha-Sn thin films are formed on Ge substrates cleaned by Acetone/IPA/H2O(80 degrees C) or H2O2/HCI, but no peak associated with crystalline alpha-Sn appears for thin films grown on Ge substrates cleaned by Acetone/IPA. Strained alpha-Sn thin films deposited on Ge substrates cleaned by Acetone/IPA/H2O(80 degrees C) are further investigated using dielectric force microscopy (DFM). Although Ge substrates where alpha-Sn thin films are deposited are p-type, DFM images indicate that the alpha-Sn thin films are n-type. The alpha-Sn/Ge heterostructures that we demonstrate in this work might be promising in applications in advanced electronics and photonics. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Benefiting from their responsiveness and adaptability, the stimuli-responsive polymers have been widely investigated and exploited in the various fields, such as environmental monitoring, electronics, photonics, controlled drug delivery, medical imaging and diagnostics. These potential applications have greatly promoted the development of advanced functional materials, and meanwhile set higher requirements for the smart materials in the aspects of the spatial structures, diverse linkages and variable functions. However, the linear functional polymers can not satisfy all the requirements of the multi-dimensional molecular design and acute sensitiveness due to the architectural limitation. Accordingly, stimuli-responsive hyperbranched polymers (HBPs) have been drawing more and more attention in recent years owing to their unique globular void-containing topological structure featured with a large number of terminal functional groups and branches, lower solution or melt viscosity, and better solubility. Therefore, design and synthesis of stimuli-responsive HBPs provide a robust tool for controlling the structure transition and creating the hierarchical sensitivity driven by different triggers. In this review, the developments and recent advances of preparation procedures, performance control and promising applications of various stimuli-responsive HBPs have been comprehensively summarized. Besides, the developing trend of stimuli-responsive HBPs is also discussed. It can be found that stimuli-responsive HBPs with different synthetic strategies and diverse performances have manifested more and more versatile applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Electromagnetic field interacting with a topologically protected one-dimensional electron helical state is shown to support a one-dimensional plasmon-polariton, which is a collective electron excitation dressed with the electromagnetic field. The electronic helical state arises at the surface of three-dimensional topological insulator in the proximity of the ferromagnet and is localized at the magnetization domain wall. This opens the possibilities to manipulate quantum optical states by altering magnetic domain configurations. An exact spectral equation for such topological plasmon-polariton is derived.

ABSTRACT: Engineering photon emission and scattering is central to modern photonics applications ranging from light harvesting to quantum-information processing. To this end, nanophotonic waveguides are well suited as they confine photons to a one-dimensional geometry and thereby increase the light-matter interaction. In a regular waveguide, a quantum emitter interacts equally with photons in either of the two propagation directions. This symmetry is violated in nanophotonic structures in which non-transversal local electric-field components imply that photon emission(1,2) and scattering(3) may become directional. Here we show that the helicity of the optical transition of a quantum emitter determines the direction of single-photon emission in a specially engineered photonic-crystal waveguide. We observe single-photon emission into the waveguide with a directionality that exceeds 90% under conditions in which practically all the emitted photons are coupled to the waveguide. The chiral light-matter interaction enables deterministic and highly directional photon emission for experimentally achievable on-chip non-reciprocal photonic elements. These may serve as key building blocks for single-photon optical diodes, transistors(4) and deterministic quantum gates(5). Furthermore, chiral photonic circuits allow the dissipative preparation of entangled states of multiple emitters(6) for experimentally achievable parameters(7), may lead to novel topological photon states(8,9) and could be applied for directional steering of light(10-13).

ABSTRACT: Metasurfaces offer great potential to control near- and far-fields through engineering optical properties of elementary cells or meta-atoms. Such perspective opens a route to efficient manipulation of the optical signals both at nanoscale and in photonics applications. In this paper we show that a local surface conductivity tensor well describes optical properties of a resonant plasmonic hyperbolic metasurface both in the far-field and in the near-field regimes, where spatial dispersion usually plays a crucial role. We retrieve the effective surface conductivity tensor from the comparative analysis of experimental and numerical reflectance spectra of a metasurface composed of elliptical gold nanoparticles. Afterwards, the restored conductivities are validated by semi-analytic parameters obtained with the nonlocal discrete dipole model with and without interaction contribution between meta-atoms. The effective parameters are further used for the dispersion analysis of surface plasmons localized at the metasurface. The obtained effective conductivity describes correctly the dispersion law of both quasi-TE and quasi-TM plasmons in a wide range of optical frequencies as well as the peculiarities of their propagation regimes, in particular, topological transition from the elliptical to hyperbolic regime with eligible accuracy. The analysis in question offers a simple practical way to describe properties of metasurfaces including ones in the near-field zone with effective conductivity tensor extracting from the convenient far-field characterization.

ABSTRACT: Plasmonic lattices of metal nanoparticles have emerged as an effective platform for strong light-matter coupling, lasing, and Bose-Einstein condensation. However, the full potential of complex unit cell structures has not been exploited. On the other hand, bound states in continuum (BICs) have attracted attention, as they provide topologically protected optical modes with diverging quality factors. Here, we show that quadrumer nanoparticle lattices enable lasing in a quasi-BIC mode with a highly out-of-plane character. By combining theory with polarization-resolved measurements of the emission, we show that the lasing mode has a topological charge. Our analysis reveals that the mode is primarily polarized out-of-plane as a result of the quadrumer structure. The quality factors of the out-of-plane BIC modes of the quadrumer array can be exceedingly high. Our results unveil the power of complex multiparticle unit cells in creating topologically protected high-Q modes in periodic nanostructures.

ABSTRACT: Higher-order corner-bound states in a 2D structure have been found to possess robust and exotic properties beyond the ordinary topological edge states, giving rise to a promising applicative potential. For example, the topological nanocavity designed based on the corner states exhibits much better performance than that of the conventional photonic crystal cavity. However, the corner states in the finite Hermitian system are usually coupled with each other, which results in the weakening of their localization. As such, the contradiction between the performance and footprint of topological devices is vexing. Here, it shows that introducing non-Hermiticity in the higher-order topological insulators is an effective strategy to enhance the localization of corner states in finite systems. By designing and analyzing the 2D finite Su-Schriffer-Heeger optical lattices with two types of non-Hermitian configuration, the localization degree of higher-order corner states is found to depend on the gain/loss strength. This is experimentally demonstrated by observing the distribution of corner states in the femtosecond-laser-writing loss-controlled waveguide arrays. This scheme tuning localization of higher-order corner-bound states by non-Hermiticity may offer a new avenue to design robust and compact devices, such as topological nano-lasers with an ultra-low threshold. Introducing non-Hermiticity in finite systems is an effective strategy to enhance the localization of higher-order corner states. Here, 2D finite optical lattices are designed with different non-Hermitian configurations, and the localization enhancement of corner states with broken-PT phase is experimentally demonstrated. This scheme tuning localization of corner states by non-Hermiticity may offer a new avenue to design compact devices.image

ABSTRACT: 2D materials van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) provide a revolutionary route toward high-performance solar energy conversion devices beyond the conventional silicon-based pn junction solar cells. Despite tremendous research progress accomplished in recent years, the searches of vdWHs with exceptional excitonic solar cell conversion efficiency and optical properties remain an open theoretical and experimental quest. Here, this study shows that the vdWH family composed of MoSi2N4 and WSi2N4 monolayers provides a compelling material platform for developing high-performance ultrathin excitonic solar cells and photonics devices. Using first-principle calculations, 51 types of MoSi2N4 and WSi2N4-based [(Mo,W)Si2N4] vdWHs composed of various metallic, semimetallic, semiconducting, insulating, and topological 2D materials are constructed and classified. Intriguingly, MoSi2N4/(InSe, WSe2) are identified as Type II vdWHs with exceptional excitonic solar cell power conversion efficiency reaching well over 20%, which are competitive to state-of-the-art silicon solar cells. The (Mo,W)Si2N4 vdWH family exhibits strong optical absorption in both the visible and UV regimes. Exceedingly large peak UV absorptions over 40%, approaching the maximum absorption limit of a freestanding 2D material, can be achieved in (Mo,W)Si2N4/alpha(2)-(Mo,W)Ge2P4 vdWHs. The findings unravel the enormous potential of (Mo,W)Si2N4 vdWHs in designing ultimately compact excitonic solar cell device technology.

ABSTRACT: Deep neural networks have been successfully applied to forward predicting optical response and inverse designing topological structure of nanophotonic devices. However, the existing deep learning based methods need sufficient simulated data to train the model effectively. For those devices with complex structures that containing many design variables, obtaining enough training data through numerical simulations will become extremely time-consuming. In order to reduce the requirement of large amounts of training data, we present a new deep learning approach based on the Capsule Network in this paper. By employing the proposed model, we have designed and verified a series of silicon-based wavelength demultiplexer with more than one thousand design variables. The numerical simulations validate that the trained model can both effectively predict the optical response with a fixed topological structure, and inverse design the approximate topological structure for a needed given optical response. Comparison with the classical convolutional neural networks show that our model can obtain nearly the same performance when using only 60% of the training data.

ABSTRACT: A unified picture of different application areas for incipient metals is presented. This unconventional material class includes several main-group chalcogenides, such as GeTe, PbTe, Sb2Te3, Bi2Se3, AgSbTe2 and Ge2Sb2Te5. These compounds and related materials show a unique portfolio of physical properties. A novel map is discussed, which helps to explain these properties and separates the different fundamental bonding mechanisms (e.g., ionic, metallic, and covalent). The map also provides evidence for an unconventional, new bonding mechanism, coined metavalent bonding (MVB). Incipient metals, employing this bonding mechanism, also show a special bond breaking mechanism. MVB differs considerably from resonant bonding encountered in benzene or graphite. The concept of MVB is employed to explain the unique properties of materials utilizing it. Then, the link is made from fundamental insights to application-relevant properties, crucial for the use of these materials as thermoelectrics, phase change materials, topological insulators or as active photonic components. The close relationship of the materials' properties and their application potential provides optimization schemes for different applications. Finally, evidence will be presented that for metavalently bonded materials interesting effects arise in reduced dimensions. In particular, the consequences for the crystallization kinetics of thin films and nanoparticles will be discussed in detail.

ABSTRACT: The twisted stacking of two layered crystals has led to the emerging moire physics as well as intriguing chiral phenomena such as chiral phonon and photon generation. In this work, we identified and theoretically formulated a non-trivial twist-enabled coupling mechanism in twisted bilayer photonic crystal (TBPC), which connects the bound state in the continuum (BIC) mode to the free space through the twist-enabled channel. Moreover, the radiation from TBPC hosts an optical vortex in the far field with both odd and even topological orders. We quantitatively analyzed the twist-enabled coupling between the BIC mode and other non-local modes in the photonic crystals, giving rise to radiation carrying orbital angular momentum. The optical vortex generation is robust against geometric disturbance, making TBPC a promising platform for well-defined vortex generation. As a result, TBPCs not only provide a new approach to manipulating the angular momentum of photons, but may also enable novel applications in integrated optical information processing and optical tweezers. Our work broadens the field of moire photonics and paves the way toward the novel application of moire physics. The Authors in this work predict the radiation of twisted bilayer photonic crystals to host an optical vortex in the far field, which is enabled by connecting BIC modes in photonic crystals with the free space through a 'moire channel'.

ABSTRACT: We investigate dissipative nonlinear dynamics in graphene-based active metamaterials composed of randomly dispersed graphene nanoflakes embedded within an externally pumped gain medium. We observe that graphene saturable nonlinearity produces a subcritical bifurcation of nonlinear modes, enabling self-organization of the emitted radiation into several dissipative soliton structures with distinct topological charges. We systematically investigate the existence domains of such nonlinear waves and their spatial dynamics, finding that soliton vortices are unstable, thus enabling self-organization into single dissipative structures with vanishing topological charge, independently of the shape of the graphene nanoflakes. Our results shed light on self-organization of coherent radiation structures in disordered systems and are relevant for future cavity-free lasers and amplifier designs.

ABSTRACT: Floquet-Bloch lattices are systems in which wave packets are subjet to periodic modulations both in time and space, showing rich dynamics. While this type of lattice is difficult to implement in solid-state physics, optical systems have provided excellent platforms to probe their physics: among other effects, they have revealed genuine phenomena such as the anomalous Floquet topological insulator and the funnelling of light into localised interface modes. Despite the crucial importance of the band dispersion in the photon dynamics and the topological properties of the lattice, the direct experimental measurement of the Floquet-Bloch bands has remained elusive. Here we report the direct measurement of the Floquet-Bloch bands of a photonic lattice with a single shot method. We use a system of two coupled fibre rings that implements a time-multiplexed Floquet-Bloch lattice. By Fourier transforming the impulse response of the lattice we obtain the band structure together with an accurate characterization of the lattice eigenmodes, i. e. the amplitudes and the phases of the Floquet-Bloch eigenvectors over the entire Brillouin zone. Our results open promising perspectives for the observation of topological effects in the linear and nonlinear regime in Floquet systems. Floquet-Bloch lattices are systems that are relatively difficult to implement in solid-state physics. Here, using a photonic lattice as an alternative, the authors experimentally observe Floquet-Bloch bands using a single-shot method which allows them to fully characterise the lattice eigenmode structure.

ABSTRACT: It is theoretically and numerically shown that when tightly focusing an n-th order vector light field that has the central V-point (at which the linear polarization direction is undetermined), the polarization singularity index n, and a flower-shaped intensity pattern with 2(n - 1) lobes it forms a transverse intensity distribution with 2(n - 1) local maxima. At the same time, a vector light field with the polarization singularity index -n, which has the form of a web with 2(n + 1) cells generates at the sharp focus a transverse intensity distribution with 2( n + 1) local maxima. In the focal spot, either 2(n-1) or 2(n + 1) V-point polarization singularities with alternating indices +1 or -1 are formed at the intensity zeros.

ABSTRACT: Random phase screen method was used to simulate the light intensity and phase distribution of the synthesized double vortex beams transmitted in atmospheric turbulence given the light intensity characteristics and phase characteristics of double Laguerre-Gaussian beams (DLGB) generated by coaxial superposition. Results show that the scintillation coefficient decreases initially, and then increases with the topological charge difference of the double vortex beam, and the topological charge difference is related to the number of split spots. When the number of split spots is small, the intensity distribution is concentrated, exhibiting a good penetrating effect on atmospheric turbulence.

ABSTRACT: In the past decade, complex networks of light emitters are proposed as novel platforms for photonic circuits and lab-on-chip active devices. Lasing networks made by connected multiple gain components and graphs of nanoscale random lasers (RLs) obtained from complex meshes of polymeric nanofibers are successful prototypes. However, in the reported research, mainly collective emission from a whole network of resonators is investigated, and only in a few cases, the emission from single points showing, although homogeneous and broad, spatial emission. In all cases, simultaneous activation of the miniaturized lasers are observed. Here, differently, we realize heterogeneous random lasers made of ribbon-like and highly porous fibers with evident RL action from separated micrometric domains that alternatively switch on and off by tuning the pumping light intensity. We visualize this novel effect by building for the first time replica symmetry breaking (RSB) maps of the emitting fibers with 2 pm spatial resolution. In addition, we calculate the spatial correlations of the laser regions showing clearly an average extension of 50 pm. The observed blinking effect is due to mode interaction along light guiding fibers and opens new avenues in the fabrication of flexible photonic networks with specific and adaptable activity.

ABSTRACT: Topological phases based on tight-binding models have been extensively studied in recent decades. By mimicking the linear combination of atomic orbitals in tight-binding models based on the evanescent couplings between resonators in classical waves, numerous experimental demonstrations of topological phases have been successfully conducted. However, in dielectric photonic crystals, the Mie resonances' states decay too slowly as 1/r$1/r$, leading to intrinsically different physics between tight-binding models and dielectric photonic crystals. Here, a confined Mie resonance photonic crystal is proposed by embedding perfect electric conductors between dielectric rods, creating the chiral symmetric band structure which ideally matches tight-binding models with nearest-neighbour couplings. As a consequence, disentangled band structure spanned by higher atomic orbitals is observed. Moreover, the result provides an effective route to achieve a 3D photonic crystal with a complete photonic bandgap and third-order topology. The implementation offers a versatile platform for studying exotic higher-orbital bands and achieving tight-binding-like 3D topological photonic crystals. A new family of photonic crystals is proposed by using metals to confine Mie resonance mode, achieving photonic tight-binding models with chiral symmetry. The conventional entangled band structure at the high frequency is now disentangled. A 3D higher-order topological photonic crystal is achieved with a large complete bandgap. These findings offer new possibilities to explore exotic photonic tight-binding models.image

ABSTRACT: A combinatory-topological analysis and simulation of the self-assembly of the crystal structure of (Sr2Au6)(Ga-3)-hR66 (spatial group R-3c, a = b = 8.419, c = 21.911 angstrom, V = 1345 angstrom(3)) is performed by the computer methods (ToposPro software package). A new geometric type of the polyhedral precursor cluster K8 = 0@8(Sr2Au6), where Au-6 rings are the base and Sr atoms serve as peaks, is established. The symmetry of the K8 cluster corresponds to -3 and the center of the cluster occupies position 6b. Another cluster K3 = 0@Ga-3 also exhibits a close symmetry of 32 and the center of the cluster occupies position 6a. A primary chain S-3(1) is formed upon the binding of [(Sr2Au6)(Ga-3)](2) dimers. The distance between the centers of dimers appeared to determine the values of the modulus of the translation vector a = 8.419 angstrom. The symmetry and topological code of the self-assembly of the 3D structures from precursor clusters K8 and K3 are simulated.

ABSTRACT: "Optical vortices are beams of laser light with screw symmetry in their wavefront. With a corresponding azimuthal dependence in optical phase, they convey orbital angular momentum, and their methods of production and applications have become one of the most rapidly accelerating areas in optical physics and technology. It has been established that the quantum nature of electromagnetic radiation extends to properties conveyed by each individual photon in such beams. It is therefore of interest to identify and characterize the symmetry aspects of the quantized fields of vortex radiation that relate to the beam and become manifest in its interactions with matter. Chirality is a prominent example of one such aspect  many other facets also invite attention. Fundamental CPT symmetry is satisfied throughout the field of optics, and it plays significantly into manifestations of chirality where spatial parity is broken  duality symmetry between electric and magnetic fields is also involved in the detailed representation. From more specific considerations of spatial inversion, amongst which it emerges that the topological charge has the character of a pseudoscalar, other elements of spatial symmetry, beyond simple parity inversion, prove to repay additional scrutiny. A photon-based perspective on these features enables regard to be given to the salient quantum operators, paying heed to quantum uncertainty limits of observables. The analysis supports a persistence in features of significance for the material interactions of vortex beams, which may indicate further scope for suitably tailored experimental design."

ABSTRACT: Detecting the optical vortices of darkness hidden in an ultra-weak background is a difficult task. Here we report an experiment demonstrating that the optical vortices can be directly visualized and identified with a smaller number of photons. Our method is based on the extension of the spiral phase contrast technique to incorporate vortex phase plates (VPP) of high-order topological charges. In our experiment, we prepare optical vortex arrays of interesting structures such as Arabic numerals and the wings carrying various topological charges. By placing various VPP filters in the Fourier plane of a 4f imaging system, the embedded vortices of an incident ultra-weak light field can be visualized, revealing both their positions and topological charges. It is found that a higher order vortex generally requires a smaller number of photons to be detected. Our method may find potential application in the fields of astronomical optics and biosensing in an ultra-weak light environment.

ABSTRACT: Optical vortex beams (VB) carrying orbital angular momentum is of great importance in many fields. In this letter, combining a polarization modulation system and high NA lens, we propose a new method for detecting the topological charge (TC) value of VB. According to the focal field intensity distribution of VB after polarization modulation, we explore the correlation between the intensity and the TC of VB. The results reveal that the tightly focusing intensity represents a smallest solid spot when the TC value of VB equals the polarization azimuthal index. Based on this property, we can determine arbitrary states of VB by the focal intensity, especially in the case of higher charge.

ABSTRACT: Objects around us constantly emit and absorb thermal radiation. The emission and absorption processes are governed by two fundamental radiative properties: emissivity and absorptivity. For reciprocal systems, the emissivity and absorptivity are restricted to be equal by Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation. This restriction limits the degree of freedom to control thermal radiation and contributes to an intrinsic loss mechanism in photonic energy harvesting systems. Existing approaches to violate KirchhofFs law typically utilize magneto-optical effects with an external magnetic field. However, these approaches require either a strong magnetic field (similar to 3T) or narrow-band resonances under a moderate magnetic field (similar to 0.3T), because the nonreciprocity in conventional magneto-optical effects is weak in the thermal wavelength range. Here, we show that the axion electrodynamics in magnetic Weyl semimetals can be used to construct strongly nonreciprocal thermal emitters that nearly completely violate Kirchhoff's law over broad angular and frequency ranges without requiring any external magnetic field.

ABSTRACT: We design a one-dimensional chain of two different alternating three-dimensional elastic chiral unit cells. The chain's topological band gap, a result of the alternation of unit cells combined with their chirality and an effective mirror symmetry, guarantees a protected edge state, corresponding to a localized twist mode with an eigenfrequency inside the one-dimensional band gap. A small axial modulation at the one end of the beam can excite this resonant twist mode at the other end of the beam, via evanescent modes in the gap. The topological robustness of the edge state allows us to add a micromirror to the other end of the beam, turning the arrangement into a resonant mechanical laser-beam scanner. Its scalable operation frequency makes it attractive for applications.

They have revealed a unique way to optical manipulation and are particularly promising for optical communications. This paper combines HG modes, as a basis, inside the nonlinear crystal and the generated second harmonic field turns to LG and IG modes. Here we present a way to use second order nonlinear media to convert optical beam modes as we wish.

ABSTRACT: Compact vortex beam emitters have emerged as new light sources for novel applications in areas including spectroscopy, particle manipulation, and communications. Reported devices depend on linear optical phenomena and emit light in the near-infrared (IR) regime. Here, we propose and numerically evaluate a nonlinear vortex beam emitter that functions in the THz regime. The design utilizes a LiNbO3 microring, a Si microdisk, and an Au second-order top grating to convert waveguide-coupled IR light into a freely propagating THz beam via a difference-frequency generation. The output beam carries a topological charge that is tunable with input wavelengths. Three devices are evaluated in a test frequency range from 9 THz to 13.5 THz, and the topological charge can change from -2 to 4. A frequency shift accompanies the change in the topological charge, and its magnitude depends on the planar dimensions of the emitter.

ABSTRACT: Visible light has an important and unique value in research and practical applications, because of its perceptible characteristics by the human eye. Directly pumped bulk visible pulsed lasers are booming in recent years stimulated by the advances of blue laser diodes. As critical components, novel and favorable saturable absorbers in view of distinct nonlinear saturable absorption properties are desired, which can promote the development of ultrafast photonics in the visible range. Over the years, low dimensional materials with the advantages of ultrafast carrier recovery rate and distinct nonlinear saturable absorption have originated a class of innovative applications in photonics and optoelectronics, especially as saturable absorbers in the pulsed lasers. Here, the low dimensional saturable absorbers in the visible range are reviewed, including the fabrication, linear and nonlinear optical response, and applications in the pulsed visible lasers of low dimensional semiconductors and noble metal nanoparticles. The design criteria of the low dimensional saturable absorbers for generating laser pluse by Q-switching and mode-locking are proposed and discussed. Finally, some possible development tendency and directions of saturable absorbers for the visible pulsed lasers are proposed in this review by focusing on some potential strengths.

ABSTRACT: Fork-shaped gratings are periodic structures containing a spatial dislocation known to be used for the production of optical vortices in a far field. Spatial overlapping of diffraction orders in a near field results in complex spatial evolution of optical vortices. In this paper, we report the results of near-field diffraction on fork-shaped gratings with different topological charges and analyze the evolution of specific optical vortices during propagation. Optical vortices have been shown to form two-dimensional well-ordered spatial configurations in specific transverse planes. The locus of points of optical singularities has been shown to form two helical lines twisted around the +/- 1 diffraction order directions. Our results demonstrate that the spatial behaviour of optical vortices is in close connection with the spatial ordering arising from the Talbot effect. The quantity of optical vortices demonstrates complex spatial dynamics, which includes spatial oscillations and decreasing along the propagation direction. These results provide a foundation towards a deeper understanding of near-field singular optics phenomena.

ABSTRACT: An optical microsensor of the laser light polarization state based on a metalens is proposed. Well-known polarization sensors based on metasurfaces usually transmit different types of polari-zation at different angles to the optical axis. The polarization sensor proposed in this work forms different patterns for different polarization types at the metalens focus. Specifically, the left-handed circular polarization at the focus forms a ring-shaped spot, the right-handed circular polari-zation - a round focal spot, and linear polarization forms an elliptical spot with two side lobes. Moreover, the angle of inclination of the elliptical focal spot corresponds to the angle of inclina-tion of the initial E-vector of the linearly polarized beam. The simulation is consistent with theo-retical predictions. A 30-mu m metalens with a low aspect ratio, high numerical aperture, and short focal length equal to the incident wavelength 633 nm in a 120-nm thick thin film of amorphous sil-icon is designed, fabricated and characterized

ABSTRACT: Fractional vortex beams (FVBs) possess unique topological properties that are manifested in the vortex distribution. However, there are still discrepancies in the value of the vortex strength of FVBs at the far field. In this work we present a complete picture of the behavior of the phase singularities of non-integer (commonly known as fractional) beams in the Fraunhofer diffraction region and demonstrate a very good correspondence between experiments and simulations. As shown in the text, the original beam waist omega(0) was found to be a key factor relating to the beam profile topology. This variable was measured in the process of calibrating the experiment. Finally, an experimental method to obtain the non-integer topological charge is proposed. This method only requires an analysis of the intensity, knowledge of the transition behaviors, and the beam waist.

ABSTRACT: Having accomplished progress in the versatile battlefields of optics, electronics, catalysis, etc., two-dimensional (2D) materials are now venturing and excelling in yet another arena of ultrafast photonics, a rapidly developing field encompassing a large range of important applications including optical modulation through optical limiting/mode-locking, photodetectors, optical communications, integrated miniaturized all-optical devices and so on. Our group has been devoted to building the arsenal of 2D materials with large third-order nonlinearities, including transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), carbon nitride, single-element materials from Group 15, 2D hybrids and vdW heterostructures. In particular, we explore their origin of nonlinear optical responses from the aspect of excited state dynamics using time-resolved spectroscopic techniques such as femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. In this review, we propose the roadmap for screening 2D materials for ultrafast photonics through focusing on the third-order nonlinear optical properties of 2D materials and corresponding applications, and then performing mechanistic investigations via time-resolved spectroscopy and calculations, which in turn provide feedback to further guide the fabrication of 2D materials. We offer our own insights on the future trends for the development and theoretical calculations of 2D materials/devices in the final part of Perspectives.

In this review, we discuss the principles and report on the current progress of wavelength-tunable pulsed fiber lasers based on graphene, graphene oxide (GO), topological insulators (TIs), transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), and black phosphorus (BP). Then, we discuss the mechanisms to achieve wavelength-tunable pulsed operation. Finally, an outlook about the development of tunable pulsed fiber lasers is presented in the perspectives.

ABSTRACT: A combinatory topological analysis and simulation of the self-assembly of the crystal structure of Ca11Hg54-hP65 (a = b = 17.114 angstrom, c = 10.442 angstrom, hexagonal group P-6) are performed by computer methods (ToposPro software package). A total of 184 variants of the cluster representation of the 3D atomic lattice with a number of structural units of 3-7 are established. The polyhedral clusters K8 = 0@Ca2Hg6, which appeared to be hexagonal bipyramids, the polyhedral clusters K11 = 0@Ca3Hg8, and the polyhedral clusters with the central Hg atom K12 = Hg(Ca3Hg8) are determined. The centers of the Ca2Hg6, 0@Ca3Hg8 and Hg(Ca(3)Hg8) clusters occupied the highly symmetric positions 1c, 1b, and 1f with a -6 symmetry. The precursor clusters Ca2Hg6 represent templates on the surface of which atomic shells of 38 atoms are formed. The composition of the two-layered template cluster K46 is 0@8(Ca2Hg6)@38(Hg-6 + CaHg6)(2)(Ca6Hg6). The symmetry and topological code for the self-assembly processes of the 3D structure from the nanoclusters-precursors K46 with participation of the polyhedral clusters 0@Ca3Hg8 and Hg(Ca3Hg8) are simulated.

ABSTRACT: Recent advances in vortex Smith-Purcell radiation (V-SPR) have spurred many breakthroughs in the generation of vortex beams for their potential applications in chiral detection, particle acceleration, communication, and imaging. However, advanced multi-mode applications of the V-SPR suffer from the incoherent spectrum and poor purity in producing high-order topological charges. Here, by exploiting the rotational symmetry and Brillouin-folding phenomenon, it is proved that the coherent V-SPR with independently steerable high-order topological charge is directly emitted from chiral spoof surface plasmons. Moreover, both topological charges and operation frequencies can be readily tuned, thus enabling flexible adaptability over a broad bandwidth. A proof-of-concept prototype is designed and fabricated in the microwave regime, in which the method is demonstrated from the perspective of symmetry and tunability. The proposed methodology can be exploited as a platform to investigate the interaction between chiral plasmons and swift electrons, promising a feasible scheme for generating coherent and tunable vortex beams from the microwave to the terahertz band.

ABSTRACT: High-resolution three-dimensional (3D) micro-/nano-fabrication techniques form an important basis for developing the modern micro-/nano-photonics. In this paper, we systematically introduce a new 3D micro-/nano-fabrication technique named as nano-kirigami, which is based on the focused ion beam (FIB) induced in-situ cutting and folding of a suspended gold film. The high-dose FIB milling fulfils the cutting process, and the low-dose FIB irradiation of the effective sample area acts as a mean of folding , well representing the fabrication principle of macro-kirigami. By utilizing the topography-guided stress equilibrium during FIB irradiation, nano-kirigami can reliably achieve rich 3D shape transformations, such as multi-directional folding, bending, buckling and twisting, with resolution down to below 50 nm. Taking the FIB-induced stress as a stimulus, the FIB-based nano-kirigami can be divided into tree-type and closed-loop fabrication from the perspective of topological classifications in multibody dynamics. The characteristics, advantages and disadvantages between the two different types of processes are analyzed and summarized in the paper. The rich 3D shape deformation characteristics bring about unimaginable possibilities for the fabrication of various novel 3D structures, and the generation of new geometries facilitates the exploration of new physics. For example, by taking advantage of the 3D plasmonic conductive couplings, the composite symmetry-broken SRR-based configuration is constructed for the efficient generation of significant chiral Fano resonances. Moreover, with the close-loop nano-kirigami induced by FIB global irradiation, the giant intrinsic optical chirality is achieved in a 3D pinwheel-like structure with exotic twisting and rotation geometric features. Especially, the rotation of the linear polarization direction, caused by the circular birefringence, reaches an efficiency of 310000 degrees/mm which exceeds the reported value of chiral metamaterial and congeneric two-dimensional planar nanostructure. Another example is the metasurface formed by alternately arranging the left-handed pinwheel structure and right-handed pinwheel structure in the horizontal plane, which can diffract cross-polarized transmitted light efficiently while clear photon spin Hall effect is observed. The introduced nano-kirigami technique, as well as the generated exotic 3D nanostructures and their photonic applications, can build up a novel 3D miro-/nano-fabrication platform for versatile structural geometries with promising functionalities, which may find great potential applications in areas such as micro-/nano-photonics, electronic and magnetic devices, plasmonics, optomechanics, micro-/nano-electromechanical systems, etc.

ABSTRACT: A terahertz (THz) superimposed perfect vortex (SPV) beam is generated by using a designed superimposed optimal phase element (SOPE) at 0.3 THz. As the superimposed topological charge changes, the ring radius of THz SPV beams remains almost constant in the experiment, whose relative error is only 0.96%. The perfect vortex property is confirmed. The intensity profile of THz SPV beams is a ring with equally spaced breakpoints. The superimposed topological charge carried can be judged directly by identifying the number of breakpoints. The ring radius is linearly related to the radial wave vector, which can be adjusted. Such THz SPV beams have promising applications for THz fiber communication systems based on vortex beams.

ABSTRACT: A novel multiplexing technique known as Spatial Domain multiplexing (SDM) has been developed in recent years and offers many advantages over its counterparts. With multiple channel transmission of the same wavelength over a single multimode carrier fiber, SDM increases the data capacity by multiple folds. Input channels are launched at appropriate input angles to produce skew ray propagation. The output of the system when projected on a screen is observed as concentric rings. These SDM beams carry orbital angular momentum. Experiments show that two input sources with the same launch conditions, but opposite topological charge take different helical paths inside the transmission fiber. Consequently the shadow of a straight wire does not remain straight. Instead, it is displaced by a specific distance. This endeavor presents a model of such a system by analyzing the shadow distortion, using principles of geometric optics. Experimentally obtained shadow displacement results are quantified and then compared to the model. We also show that when two channels with opposite topological charges are transmitted with same launch conditions, their orbital angular momenta are equal and opposite. As a result orbital Angular momentum based multiplexing can be used to add another degree of freedom to photons.

ABSTRACT: Optical skyrmions are quasiparticles with nontrivial topological textures that have significant potential in optical information processing, transmission, and storage. Here, we theoretically and experimentally achieve the conversion of optical skyrmions among Neel, Bloch, intermediate skyrmions, and bimerons by polarization devices, where the fusion and annihilation of optical skyrmions are demonstrated accordingly. By analyzing the polarization pattern in Poincare beams, we reveal the skyrmion topology dependence on the device, which provides a pathway for the study of skyrmion interactions. A vectorial optical field generator is implemented to realize the conversion and superposition experimentally, and the results are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions. These results enhance our comprehension of optical topological quasiparticles, which could have a significant impact on the transfer, storage, and communication of optical information.

ABSTRACT: In this study, an anomalous ring-connected optical vortex array (ARC-OVA) via the superposition of two grafted optical vortices (GOVs) with different topological charges (TCs) has been proposed. Compared with conventional OVAs, the signs and distribution of the OVs can be individually modulated, while the number of OVs remains unchanged. In particular, the positive and negative OVs simultaneously appear in the same intensity ring. Additionally, the size of the dark core occupied by the OV can be modulated, and the specific dark core is shared by a pair of plus-minus OVs. This work deepens our knowledge about connected OVAs and facilitates new potential applications, especially in particle manipulation and optical measurement.

ABSTRACT: As a new two-dimensional (2D) material, zirconium telluride (ZrTe3) is a typical charge density wave (CDW) material with strong electrical and optical anisotropy compared with graphene, transition metal disulfides (TMDs), topological insulators (TIs), and black phosphorus (BPs). To date, the nonlinear optical properties of ZrTe3 and its applications in information photonics aspect have not been reported. In this work, the nonlinear optical saturable absorption properties of ZrTe3 nanosheets and their application in passively mode-locked fiber laser are systematically investigated for the first time. The results show that the modulation depth and saturation intensity are 6.5% and 89.87 MW/cm(2) at the optical fiber communication band (C band), respectively. In the erbium-doped fiber (EDF) ring laser with ZrTe3 nanosheets as saturable absorber (SA), a stable mode-locked pulse train is obtained with the central wavelength of 1562.12 nm, the 3 dB optical spectral width of 2.07 nm, the basic repetition rate of 3.377 MHz, and the pulse duration of 1.469 ps when the pump power is 65 mW. Moreover, the dynamic evolution process of the optical spectrum and pulse sequence under different pump power are illustrated. All results reveal that ZrTe3 has excellent potential for applying in many fields, including ultra-fast all-optical sampling, optical frequency comb, optical fiber communication, supercontinuum, etc, and provides an intuition of opening new avenues toward various advanced information photonic devices.

ABSTRACT: Berry phase can be used to generate quantum state which is robust to environmental noises in quantum information processing. Recently, the relationship between Berry phase and quantum phase transition attracts great attention in the research about topological states of matter. Here, we investigate the behavior of Berry phase in an anti parity-time symmetric system consisting of a metal nanoparticle and semiconductor quantum dot. The change of Berry phase undergoes a sudden death around exceptional point, i.e., Berry phase keeps unchanged in symmetry unbroken region, while it can be well adjusted through changing the strength and frequency of input light in symmetry broken region. The result demonstrated in this paper may be of significant importance in quantum computation and topological physics.

ABSTRACT: The evenly spaced modes of an electromagnetic resonator are coupled to each other by appropriate time modulation, leading to dynamics analogous to those of particles hopping between different sites of a lattice. This substitution of a real spatial dimension of a lattice with a synthetic dimension in frequency space greatly reduces the hardware complexity of an analog quantum simulator. Complex control and readout of a highly multimoded structure can thus be accomplished with very few physical control lines. We demonstrate this concept with microwave photons in a superconducting transmission line resonator by modulating the system parameters at frequencies near the resonator's free spectral range and observing propagation of photon wave packets in time domain. The linear propagation dynamics are equivalent to a tight-binding model, which we probe by measuring scattering parameters between frequency sites. We extract an approximate tight-binding dispersion relation for the synthetic lattice and initialize photon wave packets with well-defined quasimomenta and group velocities. As an example application of this platform in simulating a physical system, we demonstrate Bloch oscillations associated with a particle in a periodic potential and subject to a constant external field. The simulated field strongly affects the photon dynamics despite photons having zero charge. Our observation of photon dynamics along a synthetic frequency dimension generalizes immediately to topological photonics and single-photon power levels, and expands the range of physical systems addressable by quantum simulation.

ABSTRACT: The rotational properties of a light beam are controlled by its spin and orbital angular momentum (SAM and OAM). The q-plate, a liquid crystal device that can give rise to a coupling of these two quantities, was introduced a few years ago, leading to several applications in classical and quantum photonics. Very recently, in particular, a specific kind of q-plate was used to generate rotational-invariant states of single photons, which were then employed for performing a demonstration of quantum key distribution without the need for establishing a common reference frame between the transmitting and the receiving units. This result may find applications in future satellite-based quantum communication. By a similar approach, photonic states having a strongly enhanced rotational sensitivity, as opposed to rotational invariance, can be generated by using q-plates with very high topological charge. Photons in these states can be obtained starting from light having a uniform linear polarization and, after a physical rotation, can be converted back into light having uniformly linear polarization. As a result, one obtains linearly polarized light whose polarization plane rotates by an angle that is proportional to the angle of physical rotation between the generation and detection stages, with a very large proportionality constant. This effect of rotational amplification, which we named photonic gear, leads to a sort of super-resolved Malus' law, potentially useful for measuring mechanical angles with very high precision.

ABSTRACT: In this paper, we demonstrate 67 fs pulse emitting with tungsten disulfide (WS2) in mode-locked erbium-doped fiber (EDF) lasers. Using the pulsed laser deposition method, WS2 is deposited on the surface of the tapered fiber to form the evanescent field. The fibertaper WS2 saturable absorber (SA) with the large modulation depth is fabricated to support the ultrashort pulse generation. The influences of the WS2 SA are analyzed through contrastive experiments on fiber lasers with or without the WS2 SA. The pulse duration is measured to be 67 fs, which is the shortest pulse duration obtained in the mode-locked fiber lasers with two dimensional (2D) material SAs. Compared to graphene, topological insulator, and other transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) SAs, results in this paper indicate that the fiber-taper WS2 SA with large modulation depth is a more promising photonic device in mode-locked fiber lasers with the wide spectrum and ultrashort pulse duration.

ABSTRACT: Synthetic dimensions provide a powerful approach for simulating condensed matter physics in cold atoms and photonics, whereby a set of discrete degrees of freedom are coupled together and reinterpreted as lattice sites along an artificial spatial dimension. However, atomic experimental realizations have been limited so far by the number of artificial lattice sites that can be feasibly coupled along the synthetic dimension. Here, we experimentally realize for the first time a very long and controllable synthetic dimension of atomic harmonic trap states. To create this, we couple trap states by dynamically modulating the trapping potential of the atomic cloud with patterned light. By controlling the detuning between the frequency of the driving potential and the trapping frequency, we implement a controllable force in the synthetic dimension. This induces Bloch oscillations in which atoms move periodically up and down tens of atomic trap states. We experimentally observe the key characteristics of this behavior in the real-space dynamics of the cloud, and verify our observations with numerical simulations and semiclassical theory. The Bloch oscillations thus act as a smoking-gun signature of the synthetic dimension, and allow us to characterize the effective band structure. Our methods provide an efficient approach for the manipulation and control of highly excited trap states, and set the stage for the future exploration of topological physics in higher dimensions through the use of a tunable artificial gauge field and finite-range interactions.

ABSTRACT: A vortex beam is a special light field that carries an orbital angular momentum (OAM). Different from a normal vortex beam, the vortex radius of a perfect vortex beam is independent of its topological charge. Due to this special property, perfect vortex beams have been widely used in fields such as optical communications, quantum optics and laser manufacturing. Traditional methods for generating perfect vortex beams are mainly based on liquid crystal spatial light modulators and digital micromirrors. These methods not only increase the system complexity but also the cost, making it hard for the system minimization and commercialization. In this paper, a radial phase shifting spiral zone plate (RSSZP) is fabricated to generate a perfect vortex beam using direct laser writing (DLW) with high fabrication speed and low cost. It is shown that the radius of a perfect vortex beam can be adjusted by tuning the radius phase shift of the RSSZP. Moreover, it is verified through interference experiment that the orbital angular momentum carried by the perfect vertex is consistent with the designed topological charge. Overall, this work demonstrated the potential of using DLW for the rapid fabrication of integrated photonic chips.

ABSTRACT: In this paper, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a vortex random fiber laser (RFL) with a controllable orbital angular momentum (OAM) mode. The topological charge of the vortex RFL can range from -50 to 50 with nearly watt-level output power. A triangular toroidal interferometer is constructed to verify the spiral phase structure of the generated vortex random laser with a special coherence property. Vortex RFLs with fractional topological charge are also performed in this work. As the first demonstration of a vortex RFL with a controllable OAM mode (to the best of our knowledge), this work may not only offer a valuable reference on temporal modulation of a vortex beam and optical field control of an RFL but also provide a potential vortex laser source for applications in imaging, sensing, and communication.

ABSTRACT: Wavelength-tunable vortex fiber lasers that could generate beams carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) hold great attention in large-capacity optical communications. The wavelength tunability of conventional vortex fiber lasers is, however, limited by a range of similar to 35 nm due to narrow bandwidth and/or insertion loss of mode conversion components. Optical metasurfaces apart from being compact planar components can flexibly manipulate light with high efficiency in a broad wavelength range. Here, we propose and demonstrate for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, a metasurface-assisted vortex fiber laser that can directly generate OAM beams with customizable topological charges. Due to the designed broadband gap-surface plasmon metasur-face, combined with an intracavity tunable filter, the laser enables an OAM beam with a center wavelength continuously tunable from 1015 to 1075 nm, nearly twice of other vortex fiber lasers ever reported. The metasurface can be designed at will to satisfy requirements for either low pump threshold or high slope efficiency of the laser. Furthermore, the cavity-metasurface configuration can be extended to generate higher-order OAM beams or more complex structured beams in different wavelength regions, which greatly broadens the possibilities for developing low-cost and high-quality structured-beam laser sources.

ABSTRACT: The realization of robust coherent energy transfer with a long range from a donor to an acceptor has many important applications in the field of quantum optics. However, it is hard to be realized using conventional schemes. Here, we demonstrate theoretically that robust energy transfer can be achieved using a photonic crystal platform, which includes the topologically protected edge state and zero-dimensional topological corner cavities. When the donor and the acceptor are put into a pair of separated topological cavities, the energy transfer between them can be fulfilled with the assistance of the topologically protected interface state. Such an energy transfer is robust against various kinds of defects, and can also occur over very long distances, which is very beneficial for biological detections, sensors, quantum information science, and so on.

ABSTRACT: On the basis of a new topological classification of phase-matching (PM) direction loci in biaxial acentric crystals, the PM Loci of Potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) crystal in second harmonic generation (SHG) and sum-, difference- frequency generation (SFG,DFG) are presented over its entire transparency region for the first time. The result shows that there are totally 5 loci and 7 transitions for SHG, 8 loci and 15 transitions for SFG/DFG. The weak temperature dependence of KTP yields that the noncritical PM (NCPM) of SHG varies slowly in the range of 20-300 degrees C.

ABSTRACT: Weyl points are isolated degeneracies in reciprocal space that are monopoles of the Berry curvature. This topological charge makes them inherently robust to Hermitian perturbations of the system. However, non-Hermitian effects, usually inaccessible in condensed-matter systems, are an important feature of photonic systems, and when added to an otherwise Hermitian Weyl material have been predicted to spread the Berry charge of the Weyl point out onto a ring of exceptional points, creating a Weyl exceptional ring and fundamentally altering its properties. Here, we observe the implications of the Weyl exceptional ring using real-space measurements of an evanescently coupled bipartite optical waveguide array by probing its effects on the Fermi arc surface states and bulk diffraction properties of the two constituent sublattices in an experimental realization of a distributed Berry charge in a topological material.

ABSTRACT: Recent molecular photonics studies have highlighted the significant role that phase-structured light possessing orbital angular momentum (OAM) can have when interacting with matter. These studies discovered chiroptical effects sensitive to both the magnitude and sign of the optical OAM in both the absorption and scattering of twisted photons by molecules and nanoparticles. Specifically, it has been shown how a structured beam engaging with electric-quadrupole transitions in the material allows a unique sensitivity to the helical-phase structure of twisted light. In this paper we highlight experimental methodologies and systems suitable to observe and quantify the chiroptical processes of Rayleigh and Raman optical activity, and the newly discovered circular-vortex differential scattering effect with structured light-including the importance of off-axis beam alignment, input beam intensity structure, multipolar moments, and scattering-angle dependencies. It is shown that with a judicious choice of experimental setup, chiroptical effects that scale with the topological charge l or OAM of the input beam enable optical activity signals to be enhanced and significantly exceed those based solely on circularly polarized, unstructured light. The new technique thus offers a highly useful and important spectroscopic application of structured light. The more detailed role that perfect optical vortices with high OAM will play in such optical activity effects is now highlighted, to show where there is substantial scope for experimental application, specifically in vibrational optical activity and chiral spectroscopy.

ABSTRACT: Accurate recognition of orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes is a major challenge for OAM-based optical communications over atmospheric turbulence channels. The turbulence-induced distortions cause difficulties for the receiver to distinguish between adjacent OAM modes. Deep learning, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), has been a promising technique in solving this problem. To improve the recognition performance, we propose a vortex modulation method that can magnify the subtle differences between closely adjacent OAM states. This allows the CNN to capture the image features more effectively and to recognize the topological charges more accurately. Numerical results show high recognition accuracy for both integer topological charges and fractional ones even under strong turbulence intensity and long propagation distance, which demonstrate the utility of the proposed method.

ABSTRACT: Compared to pure vortex waves, the superposition state of spherical waves and vortex waves has enough degrees of freedom to upgrade applications in particle manipulation, information encryption, and large-capacity communications. Here, we propose a new scheme to achieve superposition states and multichannel transmission of vortex and spherical waves. Two transmissive all-silicon metasurfaces that enable mutual interference between linearly polarized (LP) waves in the terahertz region are demonstrated. Type A can achieve interference between x and y polarized waves, while type B can achieve interference between x (or y) and x (or y) polarized waves. The multichannel transmission and superposition states of topological charges of +3, +2, and +4 are designed and demonstrated from theoretical, simulative, and experimental perspectives at 1.1 THz. In addition, the objective fact that the focused superposition state must be observed close to the focal plane is also revealed. The measured results are in good agreement with the theoretical and simulative results. This work provides an idea for the design of ultrathin terahertz devices and could be applied in the fields of information encryption and highfrequency communications. (c) 2023 Chinese Laser Press

ABSTRACT: Unconventional Weyl points with topological charges higher than 1 can transform into various complex unconventional Weyl exceptional contours under non-Hermitian perturbations. However, theoretical studies of these exceptional contours have been limited to tight-binding models. Here, we propose to realize unconventional Weyl exceptional contours in photonic continua-non-Hermitian anisotropic chiral plasma, based on ab initio calculation by Maxwell's equations. By perturbing in-plane permittivity, an unconventional Weyl point can transform into a quadratic Weyl exceptional ring, a type I Weyl exceptional chain with one chain point, a type II Weyl exceptional chain with two chain points, or other forms. Realistic metamaterials with effective constitutive parameters are proposed to implement these unconventional Weyl exceptional contours. Our work paves a way toward exploration of exotic physics of unconventional Weyl exceptional contours in non-Hermitian topological photonic continua. (C) 2021 Chinese Laser Press

ABSTRACT: In this paper, partially coherent radially polarized (RP) Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) rotationally symmetrical power-exponent phase vortex (RSPEPV) beams with the LG-correlated Schell-model (LGSM) were introduced. The statistical properties of the tightly focused beams, including intensity distribution, degrees of polarization and coherence, and Stokes vector, were studied based on vectorial Richards-Wolf diffraction integral theory. Moreover, when the distance between focal plane and the observation plane z = 0, the relationships between the tight-focusing properties of RP-LG-RSPEPV beams with LGSM and the order of LGSM p', topological charges l, power exponent n, spatial correlation delta, and radial index p were investigated. The results show that by changing the order of LGSM, topological charge, power exponent, spatial correlation length, and radial index, the focal spot distribution of various shapes can be obtained. This work provides ideas for the application of partially coherent beams in particle capture and optical tweezers.

ABSTRACT: The orbital angular momentum (OAM) owning to the special superiority with the inherent orthogonality, has been identified as an information carrier. In this paper, we proposed a simple and direct method for measurement the OAM of the vortex beam by using vortex grating encrypted OAM holography. When the detected beam illuminates the designed OAM holography, the topological charge ( TC)value will be directly read from the reconstruct results which appear as a series of solid Gaussian or ring spots at the output surface of the system. Thus, according to the reconstruct results, we can not only easily detect the modulus but also the sign of the incident beam. Furthermore, it can simultaneously identify OAM modes of multiple incident vortex beams. It's demonstrated that the proposed method is an efficient and flexible method.

ABSTRACT: Using e-beam lithography and reactive ion beam etching of a 120 nm amorphous silicon film, we fabricate a 30?m spiral metalens that has a very short focal length that is equal to the incident 633 nm wavelength (numerical aperture about 1) and is composed of 16-sectored subwavelength binary gratings with a 220 nm period. Its unique feature is that the metalens generates a left-hand circularly polarized optical vortex with topological charge 2 when illuminated by a left-hand circularly polarized light but generates a cylindrical second-order vector beam when illuminated by linearly polarized light. Both for linearly and circularly polarized light, an inverse energy flow occurs near the strong focus of the metalens. Transverse near-focus intensity distributions measured with a scanning near-field optical microscope are found to be in qualitative agreement with those obtained via the FDTD-aided numerical simulation. Thus, the near-focus reverse energy flow is experimentally confirmed to occur.

ABSTRACT: Synchronized rotation of unit cells in a periodic structure provides a novel design perspective for manipulation of band topology. We then design a two-dimensional version of higher-order topological insulator (HOTI) by such rotation in a triangular photonic lattice with C-3 symmetry. This HOTI supports the hallmark zero-dimensional corner states and, simultaneously, the one-dimensional edge states. We also find that our photonic corner states carry chiral orbital angular momenta locked by valleys, whose wave functions are featured by the phase vortex (singularity) positioned at the maximal Wyckoff points. Moreover, when excited by a fired source with various frequencies, the valley topological states of both one-dimensional edges and zero-dimensional corners emerge simultaneously. Extendable to higher or synthetic dimensions, our paper provides access to a chiral vortex plat-form for HOTI realizations in the terahertz photonic system. (C) 2022 Chinese Laser Press

ABSTRACT: Orbital angular momentum (OAM) detection is a key technique in the applications of vortex beams. In this letter, we propose a simple method to flexibly determine the high-order OAM state of a vortex beam with a petal-like zone plate (PZP). It is theoretically demonstrated that the far-field diffraction of the product of vortex beam and PZP is a Hermitian-like form of the vortex beam. Therefore, the magnitude of the topological charges (TCs) as well as the sign of incident vortex beam can be read from the numbers and direction of the dark lines in the Hermite-like pattern. Possessing the multiple focusing characteristic, the Hermite-like pattern of detected vortex beam can be found in a range of distance instead of a certain location. Meanwhile, to promise a high detection efficiency, the key parameters of PZP have been studied in details. Experimental results agree well with the theoretical prediction. It is testified that the measured TCs can be up to 100.

ABSTRACT: We study the generation of harmonics from graphene under the influence of an artificial magnetic field, generated via bending of a graphene flake. We show how the Landau level structure induced by the pseudomagnetic field breaks the centrosymmetry of graphene, thus allowing the generation of even harmonics. We also show that depending on the impinging pulse duration, the nonlinear signal does not only contain the integer harmonics of the impinging pulse but also its half-integer ones due to the peculiar square-root-like nature of Landau levels in graphene.

ABSTRACT: We studied the transport properties of a driven-dissipative photonic network, where multiple photonic cavities are coupled through a nonreciprocal bus with unidirectional transmission. For short-range coupling between the cavities, the occurrence of nonreciprocal amplification can be linked to a topological phase transition of the underlying dynamic Hamiltonian. However, for long-range coupling, we show that the correspondence between the nonreciprocal amplification transition and the topological phase transition breaks down as the transition conditions deviate significantly from each other. We found the exact transition condition for nonreciprocal am-plification, supported by analytical calculation and numerical simulation. We also investigated the stability, the crossover from short-to long-range coupling, and the bandwidth of the nonreciprocal amplification. Our work has potential applications in signal transmission and amplification, and also paves the way to study other topo-logical and non-Hermitian systems with long-range coupling and nontrivial boundary effects.(c) 2023 Chinese Laser Press

ABSTRACT: Smith-Purcell radiation (SPR) is the electromagnetic wave generated by free electrons passing above a diffraction grating, and it has played an important role in free-electron light sources and particle accelerators. Orbital angular momentum (OAM) is a new degree of freedom that can significantly promote the capacity of information carried by an electro-magnetic beam. In this paper, we propose an integrable method for generating vortex Smith-Purcell radiation (VSPR), namely, SPR carrying OAM, by having free-electron bunches pass on planar holographic gratings. VSPRs generated by different electron energies, with different topological charges of the OAM, radiation angles, and frequencies are demonstrated numerically. It is also found that, for high-order radiation, the topological charge of the OAM wave will be multiplied by the radiation order. This work introduces a new way to generate SPR with OAM and provides a method to achieve an integratable and tunable free-electron OAM wave source at different frequency regions.

ABSTRACT: We study the tight focusing properties of partially coherent, partially polarized vortex beams through a high numerical aperture (NA) objective. The influence of the degree of polarization, the topological charge, the correlation length of the incident beam, and the NA of the objective on the intensity in the focal region is investigated in great detail. We also perform a study on the degree of coherence around the focal plane. We found that the intensity distribution and the degree of coherence in the focal region will change with the variation of the degree of polarization and the other parameters of the incident beams.

ABSTRACT: Colloidal self-assembly has been one of the major driving themes in material science to obtain functional and advanced optical materials with complex architecture. Most of the nematic colloids reported so far are based on the optically isotropic spherical microparticles. We study organic single crystal micro-sheets and investigate their orientation, interaction and directed assembly in a nematic liquid crystal. The micro-sheets induce planar surface anchoring of the liquid crystal. The elasticity mediated pair interaction of micro-sheets shows quadrupolar characteristics. The average orientation angle of the micro-sheets in a planar cell and the angle between two micro-sheets in a homeotropic cell are supported by the Landau-de Gennes Q-tensor modeling. The self-assembly of the micro-sheets is assisted by a laser tweezer to form larger two-dimensional structures which have the potential for application of colloids in photonics.

ABSTRACT: In optical communications, it is desirable to know some quantities describing a light field, which are conserved on propagation or resistant to some distortions. Typically, optical vortex beams are characterized by their orbital angular momentum (OAM) and/or topological charge (TC). Here, we show analytically that the OAM of a single rotationally symmetric optical vortex is not affected by an arbitrary-shape aperture or by other amplitude perturbations. For a superposition of two or several optical vortices (with different TCs), we studied what happens to its OAM when it is distorted by a hard-edge sector aperture. We discovered several cases when such perturbation does not violate the OAM of the whole superposition. The first case is when the incident beam consists of two vortices of the same power. The second case is when the aperture half-angle equals n multiplied by an integer number and divided by the difference between the topological charges. For more than two incident beams, this angle equals n multiplied by an integer number and divided by the greatest common divisor of all possible differences between the topological charges. We also show that such a sector aperture also conserves the orthogonality between the complex amplitudes of the constituent vortex beams. For two incident vortex beams with real-valued radial envelopes of the complex amplitudes, the OAM is also conserved, when there is a +/-pi/2 phase delay between the beams. When two beams with the same power pass through a binary radial grating, their total OAM is also conserved. We hope that these findings could be useful for optical communications since they allow for the identification of incoming optical signals by their OAM by registering only part of the light field within a sector aperture, thus reducing the cost of the receiving devices.

ABSTRACT: We propose a mechanism of intravalley spin-flip scattering in spin-valley-coupled two-dimensional (2D) systems by transferring the momentum of light into the exciton center of mass using optical vortex (OV) beams. By varying the dispersion of light using the topological charge of the OV beam, we demonstrate a unique approach to control the intravalley spin-flip scattering rate of excitons. From our photoluminescence measurements, we demonstrate that the intravalley scattering rate in W-based TMDs can be tuned externally by OV beams. Variation of photoluminescence intensity with topological charges shows a crossover temperature (>150 K), indicating competition among time scales involving radiative recombination, spin-flip scattering, and thermal relaxations. Our proposed technique utilizing a structured light beam can open up a new approach to exploring the physics of excitons in 2D systems.

ABSTRACT: We investigate the excitation of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) using a metallic nanoaperture array illuminated by circularly polarized Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) vortex beams. The direction of SPP excitation is tunable by changing the circular polarization and topological charge of LG beams. The left- or right-handed circular polarization determines SPP propagation on either side of the nanoaperture array. Furthermore, varying the topological charge of LG beam will result in beam splitting of SPPs. We also utilize a composite nanoaperture array with different periods to achieve unidirectional excitation of SPPs. The study provides an interesting approach to control the excitation direction of SPPs and may find great applications in SPP generators and optical switches.

ABSTRACT: The unidirectional excitation of near-field optical modes is a fundamental prerequisite for many photonic applications, such as wireless power transfer and information communications. We experimentally construct all-electric Huygens and spin metasources and demonstrate anomalous unidirectional excitation of high-k hyperbolic modes in two types of hyperbolic metasurfaces. We use a Huygens metasource to study the unidirectional excitation of hyperbolic bulk modes in a planar hyperbolic metamaterial (HMM). Specifically, unidirectional excitation is the same as that in free space in the vertical direction, but opposite to that in free space in the horizontal direction. This anomalous unidirectional excitation is determined by the anisotropic HMM dispersion. In addition, we use a spin metasource to observe the anomalous photonic spin Hall effect in a planar hyperbolic waveguide. For a near-field source with a specific spin, the guide mode with a fixed directional wave vector is excited due to spin-momentum locking. Because the directions of momentum and energy flows in the HMM waveguide are opposite, the unidirectional excitation of hyperbolic guided modes is reversed. Our results not only uncover the sophisticated electromagnetic functionalities of metasources in the near-field but may also provide novel opportunities for the development of integrated optical devices.

ABSTRACT: Optical bound states in the continuum (BICs) are states supported by a photonic structure that are compatible with free-space radiation, yet become perfectly bound for one specific in-plane momentum and wavelength(1,2). Recently, it was predicted that light radiated by such modes around the BIC momentum-frequency condition should display a vortex in its far-field polarization profile, making the BIC topologically protected(3). Here, we study a one-dimensional grating supporting a transverse magnetic mode with a BIC near 700 nm wavelength, verifying the existence of the BIC using reflection measurements, which show a vanishing reflection feature. Using k-space polarimetry, we measure the full polarization state of reflection around the BIC, highlighting the presence of a topological vortex. We use an electromagnetic dipole model to explain the observed BIC through destructive interference between two radiation channels, characteristic of a Friedrich-Wintgen- type BIC4. Our findings shed light on the origin of BICs and verify their topological nature.

ABSTRACT: Cylindrical vector beams (CVBs), which possess polarization distribution of rotational symmetry on the transverse plane, can be developed in many optical technologies. Conventional methods to generate CVBs contain redundant interferometers or need to switch among diverse elements, thus being inconvenient in applications containing multiple CVBs. Here we provide a passive polarization-selective device to substitute interferometers and simplify generation setup. It is accomplished by reversing topological charges of orbital angular momentum based on a polarization-selective Gouy phase. In the process, tunable input light is the only condition to generate a CVB with arbitrary topological charges. To cover both azimuthal and radial parameters of CVBs, we express the mapping between scalar Laguerre-Gaussian light on a basic Poincare sphere and CVB on a high-order Poincare sphere. The proposed device simplifies the generation of CVBs enormously and thus has potential in integrated devices for both quantum and classic optical experiments. (C) 2021 Chinese Laser Press

ABSTRACT: The authors report a chemical process to remove the native oxide on Ge and Bi2Se3 crystals, thus facilitating high-resolution electron beam lithography (EBL) on their surfaces using a hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) resist. HSQ offers the highest resolution of all the commercially available EBL resists. However, aqueous HSQ developers such as NaOH and tetramethylammonium hydroxide have thus far prevented the fabrication of high-resolution structures via the direct application of HSQ to Ge and Bi2Se3, due to the solubility of components of their respective native oxides in these strong aqueous bases. Here we provide a route to the generation of ordered, high-resolution, high-density Ge and Bi2Se3 nanostructures with potential applications in microelectronics, thermoelectric, and photonics devices.

ABSTRACT: Emergent from the discrete spatial periodicity of plasmonic arrays, surface lattice resonances (SLRs) are characterized as dispersive, high-quality polaritonic modes that can be selectively excited at specific points in their photonic band structure by plane-wave light of varying frequency, polarization, and angle of incidence. Room-temperature Bose- Einstein condensation of exciton polaritons, lasing, and nonlinear matter-wave physics have all found origins in SLR systems, but to date, little attention has been paid to their thermal behavior. Here, we combine analytical theory and numerical calculations to investigate the photothermal properties of SLRs in periodic 1D and 2D arrays of plasmonic nanoparticles coupled to each other and to the electromagnetic far-field via transverse radiation. Specifically, we demonstrate how to create steady-state SLR thermal gradients spanning from the nanoscale to hundreds of microns that are actively controllable using light in spite of heat diffusion. We also demonstrate the surprising ability to localize thermal gradients at the lattice edges in topologically non-trivial SLR dimer lattices, thereby establishing a class of extraordinary thermal responses that are unconventional in ordinary materials. This work exposes a new direction in thermoplasmonics that has only just now begun to be explored.

ABSTRACT: We propose an experimentally friendly scheme for trapping quasi-relativistic electrons in graphene by an electromagnetic beam with circular polarization and a spatially inhomogeneous profile with an intensity dip. The trapping is achieved due to the effect of band-gap opening outside the trapping region. The proposed mechanism allows for non-invasive electron confinement in graphene without any need for the chemical patterning of the sample or the application of metallic gates.

ABSTRACT: From cosmology to the microscopic scales of the quantum world, the study of topological excitations is essential for the understanding of phase conformation and phase transitions. Quantum fluids are convenient systems to investigate topological entities because well-established techniques are available for their preparation, control and measurement. Across a phase transition, a system dramatically changes its properties because of the spontaneous breaking of certain continuous symmetries, leading to generation of topological defects. In particular, attention is given to entities that involve both spin and phase topologies. Exciton-polariton condensates are quantum fluids combining coherence and spin properties that, thanks to their light-matter nature, bring the advantage of direct optical access to the condensate order parameter. Here we report on the spontaneous occurrence of hyperbolic spin vortices in polariton condensates, by directly imaging both their phase and spin structure, and observe the associated spatial polarization patterns, spin textures that arise in the condensate.

ABSTRACT: We directly visualize the response of nematic liquid crystal drops of toroidal topology threaded in cellulosic fibers, suspended in air, to an AC electric field and at different temperatures over the N-I transition. This new liquid crystal system can exhibit non-trivial point defects, which can be energetically unstable against expanding into ring defects depending on the fiber constraining geometries. The director anchoring tangentially near the fiber surface and homeotropically at the air interface makes a hybrid shell distribution that in turn causes a ring disclination line around the main axis of the fiber at the center of the droplet. Upon application of an electric field, E, the disclination ring first expands and moves along the fiber main axis, followed by the appearance of a stable spherical particle object orbiting around the fiber at the center of the liquid crystal drop. The rotation speed of this particle was found to vary linearly with the applied voltage. This constrained liquid crystal geometry seems to meet the essential requirements in which soliton-like deformations can develop and exhibit stable orbiting in three dimensions upon application of an external electric field. On changing the temperature the system remains stable and allows the study of the defect evolution near the nematic-isotropic transition, showing qualitatively different behaviour on cooling and heating processes. The necklaces of such liquid crystal drops constitute excellent systems for the study of topological defects and their evolution and open new perspectives for application in microelectronics and photonics.

ABSTRACT: Using computer methods (the ToposPro software package), the combinatorial-topological analysis and modeling of the self-assembly of the Na99Hg468-hP567 crystal structure are carried out with the following parameters of the hexagonal cell: a = b = 39.703 angstrom, c = 9.681 angstrom, V = 13216 angstrom(3), space group P-6, and 132 crystallographically independent atoms. Three supracluster precursors K175-A, K175-B, and K175-C composed of Na18Hg157 are identified in the form of three connected gear rings of Na-polyhedra with symmetry g = -6. The symmetry and topological code for the self-assembly of the 3D structures from the precursor nanoclusters is reconstructed. In the [001] direction, the K175 supracluster precursors are linked by Hg-6 gear rings and Na spacers to form columns. In the columns, the distance between supraclusters K175 determines the value of the translational vector modulus c = 9.681 angstrom. When a skeleton is formed in the local environment of a column of K175-C supraclusters (centered at a height of z = 0), six columns of alternating K175-A and K175-B supraclusters are located with an offset of 1/2 in the [001] direction. The distance between equivalent columns from K175 clusters corresponds to the value of the translation vector modules a and b.

ABSTRACT: Direct generation of vortex beam by mode polarization selection is presented. Due to the dual-polarization property of the laser cavity, two perpendicular polarized transverse modes are simultaneously generated. One is a TEM00 mode and the other is a dark hollow one, which is vortex beam. The topological charge number and the handedness of the generated vortex beam are measured, as well as the spectral and temporal properties. The results show that the beam is a Laguerre-Gaussian mode with the topological charge number of l= +/- 1. Near single frequency mode of the vortex beam is achieved, with a chaotic pulsation temporal output.

ABSTRACT: Beyond the adiabatic limit, the Aharonov-Anandan phase is a generalized description of Berry's phase. In this regime, systems with time-independent Hamiltonians may also acquire observable geometric phases. Here we report on a measurement of the Aharonov-Anandan phase in photonics. Different from previous optical experiments on geometric phases, the implementation is based on light modes confined in evanescently coupled waveguides rather than polarization-like systems, thereby physical models in more than two-dimensional Hilbert spaces are achievable. In a tailored photonic lattice, we realize time-independent quantum-driven harmonic oscillators initially prepared in the vacuum state and achieve a measurement of the Aharonov-Anandan phase via integrated interferometry.

ABSTRACT: "We model the effect of the off-axis distance of edge dislocation on the transmission of mixed higher order optical vortex-edge dislocations in atmospheric turbulence. We find that when mixed dislocations beams propagate through atmospheric turbulence, the higher order optical vortex will break down, and the topological charge is conserved in the process  an edge dislocation evolves into a pair of optical vortices with the opposite topological charge. With the increase of the propagation distance, one of the optical vortices that are broken down and one of the optical vortices that are evolved will annihilate. And the bigger the off-axis distance of edge dislocation is, the bigger the annihilation distance of optical vortices is. The results illustrate that as the off-axis distance of edge dislocation increases, the transmission of mixed dislocations propagating through atmospheric turbulence becomes better."

ABSTRACT: Pulsed lasers have wide applications in several fields, such as basic research, telecommunications, and industrial materials processing. A saturable absorber (SA) is a key component for pulse laser generation. However, the current SAs exhibit certain limitations. Hence, developing new nonlinear optical materials as SAs for pulse lasers generation is significantly important in ultrafast photonics and related applications. Metallic nanomaterials have attracted considerable attention because of their higher nonlinearity coefficients and wideband nonlinear response, which are induced by the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect. The SPR effect depends on the size and morphology of materials. Thus, the nonlinear optical absorption effect of gold nanomaterials for pulse laser generation must be explored. In this review, the optical properties of gold nanomaterials are introduced, including SPR absorption, photoluminescence properties, and surface-enhanced Raman scattering effect. Then, the synthesis and characterization of different gold nanomaterials are reviewed. Subsequently, the nonlinear optical characteristics and devices based on gold nanomaterials are also introduced. Furthermore, the generation of different types of lasers using gold nanomaterial-based devices is also reviewed. A comparison between gold nanomaterials and other SA materials is presented. Finally, the conclusion and outlook on gold nanomaterial-based nonlinear optical devices are presented.

ABSTRACT: It is shown that the reverse energy flow (negative projection of the Poynting vector on the optical axis) occur in the tight focus of an optical vortex with topological charge 2 and left-hand circular polarization because the axial spin flow has a negative projection on the optical axis and is greater in magnitude than the positive projection of the orbital energy flow on the optical axis (canonical energy flow). Also, using the Richards-Wolf integral, it is shown that in the area of the reverse energy flow on the optical axis, right-hand circular polarization of light takes place, although light with left-hand circular polarization is focused.

It visualises the motion of the singularities and quantifies their charges while the wave field propagates. We will explain how this procedure works and present some singularity trajectories calculated by this method. It will turn out that this procedure might be very useful for investigating the behaviour of phase singularities.

ABSTRACT: The orbital angular momentum of optical fields, besides the amplitude, frequency, and phase, offers a new degree of freedom to manipulate the light-matter interactions. Here, Fano resonance and slow-to-fast light conversion in a Laguerre-Gaussian rovibrational cavity are investigated. The system consists of a Fabry-Perot cavity with two spiral phase elements acting as the cavity mirrors, in which one of the spiral phase elements is fixed while the other can vibrate as well as rotate. Fano resonances are observed by adjusting the frequency detuning between the cavity and the driving fields. Double Fano resonances are observed for the Laguerre-Gaussian rovibrational cavity with different vibrational and rotational frequencies. Both the slow and fast light can be achieved with the same setup, which is controlled by the topological charge value and the frequency detuning between the probe and driving fields, thus providing a flexible and effective way to manipulate the slow-to-fast light conversion.

ABSTRACT: Near-field imaging techniques, at terahertz frequencies (1-10 THz), conventionally rely on bulky laser sources and detectors. Here, we employ a semiconductor heterostructure laser as a THz source and, simultaneously, as a phase-sensitive detector, exploiting optical feedback interferometry combined with scattering near-field nanoscopy. We analyze the amplitude and phase sensitivity of the proposed technique as a function of the laser driving current and of the feedback attenuation, discussing the operational conditions ideal to optimize the nano-imaging contrast and the phase sensitivity. As a targeted nanomaterial, we exploit a thin (39 nm) flake of Bi2Te2.2Se0.8, a topological insulator having infrared active optical phonon modes. The self-mixing interference fringes are analyzed within the Lang-Kobayashi formalism to rationalize the observed variations as a function of Acket's parameter C in the full range of weak feedback (C < 1).

ABSTRACT: "Oxide electronic materials provide a plethora of possible applications and offer ample opportunity for scientists to probe into some of the exciting and intriguing phenomena exhibited by oxide systems and oxide interfaces. In addition to the already diverse spectrum of properties, the nanoscale form of oxides provides a new dimension of hitherto unknown phenomena due to the increased surface-to-volume ratio. Oxide electronic materials are becoming increasingly important in a wide range of applications including transparent electronics, optoelectronics, magnetoelectronics, photonics, spintronics, thermoelectrics, piezoelectrics, power harvesting, hydrogen storage and environmental waste management. Synthesis and fabrication of these materials, as well as processing into particular device structures to suit a specific application is still a challenge. Further, characterization of these materials to understand the tunability of their properties and the novel properties that evolve due to their nanostructured nature is another facet of the challenge. The research related to the oxide electronic field is at an impressionable stage, and this has motivated us to contribute with a roadmap on 'oxide electronic materials and oxide interfaces'. This roadmap envisages the potential applications of oxide materials in cutting edge technologies and focuses on the necessary advances required to implement these materials, including both conventional and novel techniques for the synthesis, characterization, processing and fabrication of nanostructured oxides and oxide-based devices. The contents of this roadmap will highlight the functional and correlated properties of oxides in bulk, nano, thin film, multilayer and heterostructure forms, as well as the theoretical considerations behind both present and future applications in many technologically important areas as pointed out by Venkatesan. The contributions in this roadmap span several thematic groups which are represented by the following authors: novel field effect transistors and bipolar devices by Fortunato, Grundmann, Boschker, Rao, and Rogers  energy conversion and saving by Zaban, Weidenkaff, and Murakami  new opportunities of photonics by Fompeyrine, and Zuniga-Perez  multiferroic materials including novel phenomena by Ramesh, Spaldin, Mertig, Lorenz, Srinivasan, and Prellier  and concepts for topological oxide electronics by Kawasaki, Pentcheva, and Gegenwart. Finally, Miletto Granozio presents the European action 'towards oxide-based electronics' which develops an oxide electronics roadmap with emphasis on future nonvolatile memories and the required technologies. In summary, we do hope that this oxide roadmap appears as an interesting up-to-date snapshot on one of the most exciting and active areas of solid state physics, materials science, and chemistry, which even after many years of very successful development shows in short intervals novel insights and achievements."

ABSTRACT: Quantum walks in an elaborately designed graph are a powerful tool for simulating physical and topological phenomena, constructing novel quantum algorithms, and realizing universal quantum computing. Integrated photonics technology has emerged as a versatile platform for implementing a variety of quantum information tasks and as a promising candidate for performing large-scale quantum walks. Both extending physical dimensions and involving more particles will increase the complexity of the evolving systems. Pioneering studies have demonstrated a single particle walking on two-dimensional lattices and multiple walkers interfering on a one-dimensional structure. However, multiple particles evolving in a genuine two-dimensional space in a scalable fashion has remained a vacancy for nearly 10 years. We present a genuine two-dimensional quantum walk with correlated photons on a triangular photonic lattice, which is mapped to a 37 x 37 high-dimensional state space. The genuine two-dimensional quantum walk breaks through the physical restrictions of single-particle evolution, allowing for the encoding of information in large spaces and construction of high-dimensional graphs, which are beneficial for quantum information processing. Between the chip and the two-dimensional fanout interface, site-by-site addressing enables simultaneous detection of over 600 nonclassical interferences and observation of quantum correlations that violate a classical limit by 57 standard deviations. Our implementation provides a paradigm for multi-photon quantum walks in a two-dimensional configuration on a large scale, paving the way for practical quantum simulation and computation beyond the classical regime.

ABSTRACT: We experimentally demonstrate an ultrafast mode-locker based on a CoSb3 skutterudite topological insulator for femtosecond mode-locking of a fiber laser. The mode-locker was implemented on a side-polished fiber platform by depositing a CoSb3/PVA composite. The measured modulation depth and saturation power for the transverse-electric mode input were similar to 5% and similar to 8.7 W, respectively, and similar to 2.8% and similar to 10.6 W for the transverse-magnetic mode input. By incorporating this mode-locker into an erbium-doped fiber-based ring cavity, we were able to readily generate mode-locked, soliton pulses having a pulse width of similar to 833 fs at 1557.9 nm. The 3-dB bandwidth of the output pulses and time-bandwidth product were similar to 3.44 and 0.353 nm, respectively. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the use of a skutterudite-based saturable absorber for femtosecond mode-locked pulse generation.

ABSTRACT: The in-memory processor has played an essential role in overcoming the von Neumann bottleneck, which arises from the partition of memory and a processing unit. Although photonic technologies have recently attracted attention for ultrafast and power-efficient in-memory computing, the realization of an all-optical in-memory processor remains a challenge. This difficulty originates from the contradiction between robustness and sensitivity in wave dynamics, requiring both noise-immune memory states and modulation-sensitive transitions between these states. Here, a building block that provides an all-optical transition between topologically protected memory states is proposed. A nonlinear photonic molecule that satisfies parity-time (PT) symmetry, revealing multiple oscillation quenching states with different degeneracies determined by PT-symmetric phases is investigated. In terms of topology for dynamical systems, these quenching states support topologically protected dynamical trajectories suitable for stable memory states. An all-optical bidirectional transition between these states, which allows incoherent memory switching is demonstrated. The result provides design criteria for all-optical in-memory processors with multilevel operations, enabling the classical-wave counterpart of electronic memristors.

ABSTRACT: Basic patterns of interaction of Gaussian and singular light beams (optical vortices) in media with resonant and thermal nonlinearity are experimentally investigated. It is demonstrated that interference of the Gaussian and singular beams in a nonlinear medium leads to the formation of dynamic volume holograms characterized by a singular structure. Under conditions of nonlinear holographic recording and Bragg diffraction on singular volume holograms, multiplexing of a topological charge and frequency conversion of optical vortices (transition from the IR to the visible range of the spectrum) is observed. Polarization recording of singular holograms that allows dynamic control to be performed over polarization of singular light beams including rotation of the polarization plane and conversion of linearly polarized radiation into circularly or elliptically polarized radiation.

ABSTRACT: Abruptly autofocusing vortex beams were proposed for a variety of applications such as optical manipulation, but their quantitative characterization of their trapping capability remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a type of autofocusing vortex beams named multi-Airy vortex beams (MAVBs) and investigate their autofocusing and trapping characteristics theoretically and experimentally. It is found that the autofocusing performance and trapping ability of MAVBs can be enhanced by adjusting the relevant parameters and increasing the number of superposed Airy within a certain range. Although the trapping force and trapping stiffness of MAVBs decrease as the topological charge increases, we found that MAVBs have advantages in capturing and manipulating large-sized particles in our experiments. In the process of manipulating multiple particles for rota-tion, the larger the topological charge, the more particles can be rotated simultaneously by MAVBs. Moreover, the speed and even the direction of rotation can be easily adjusted by controlling the degree of dispersion between particles. Our work provides a guide to quantitatively exploring the optical trapping capabilities of autofocusing vortex beams, which may lead to different photonic tools for optical trapping and manipulation.

ABSTRACT: In order to explore the potential application of a superimposed Hermite-Gaussian correlated Schell-model beams with off-axis multi-vortices in optical trapping, based on the generalized Collins formula, the focused beam intensity and radiation force on particles are derived in detail. Numerical results show that the gradient force and capture stability range increase with the increase of topological charge. By changing the vortex off-axis distance, the precise position control of the particles can be made. Adjusting the number of vortices can control the existence of vortex singularity on the side lobe of the beam, and generate or close the optical potential well or optical cage in real time. By selecting the appropriate beam order, two kinds of particles with different refractive indexes can be captured. The beams are expected to be applied to optical trapping of multiple particles at different positions.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Flatbands have become a cornerstone of contemporary condensed-matter physics and photonics. In electronics, flatbands entail comparable energy bandwidth and Coulomb interaction, leading to correlated phenomena such as the fractional quantum Hall effect and recently those in magic-angle systems. In photonics, they enable properties including slow light(1) and lasing(2). Notably, flatbands support supercollimation-diffractionless wavepacket propagation-in both systems(3,4). Despite these intense parallel efforts, flatbands have never been shown to affect the core interaction between free electrons and photons. Their interaction, pivotal for free-electron lasers(5), microscopy and spectroscopy(6,7), and particle accelerators(8,9), is, in fact, limited by a dimensionality mismatch between localized electrons and extended photons. Here we reveal theoretically that photonic flatbands can overcome this mismatch and thus remarkably boost their interaction. We design flatband resonances in a silicon-on-insulator photonic crystal slab to control and enhance the associated free-electron radiation by tuning their trajectory and velocity. We observe signatures of flatband enhancement, recording a two-order increase from the conventional diffraction-enabled Smith-Purcell radiation. The enhancement enables polarization shaping of free-electron radiation and characterization of photonic bands through electron-beam measurements. Our results support the use of flatbands as test beds for strong light-electron interaction, particularly relevant for efficient and compact free-electron light sources and accelerators.

ABSTRACT: The silicon pressure sensor has been developed for over thirty years and widely used in automobiles, medical instruments, commercial electronics, etc. There are many different specifications of silicon pressure sensors that cover a very large sensing range, from less than 1 psi to as high as 1000 psi. The key elements of the silicon pressure sensor are a square membrane and the piezoresistive strain gages near the boundary of the membrane. The dimensions of the membrane determine the full sensing range and the sensitivity of the silicon sensor, including thickness and in-plane length. Unfortunately, in order to change the sensing range, the manufacturers need to order a customized epi wafer to get the desired thickness. All masks (usually six) have to be re-laid and re-fabricated for different membrane sizes. The existing technology requires at least three months to deliver the prototype for specific customer requests or the new application market. This research proposes a new approach to dramatically reduce the prototyping time from three months to one week. The concept is to tune the rigidity of the sensing membrane by modifying the boundary conditions without changing the plenary size. An extra mask is utilized to define the geometry and location of deep-RIE trenches and all other masks remain the same. Membranes with different depths and different patterns of trenches are designed for different full sensing ranges. The simulation results show that for a 17um thick and 750um wide membrane, the adjustable range by tuning trench depth is about 45% ( from 5um to 10um), and can go to as high as 100% by tuning both the pattern and depth of the trenches. Based on an actual test in a product fabrication line, we verified that the total delivery time can be minimized to one week to make the prototyping very effective and cost-efficient.

ABSTRACT: Structured optical fields embedded with polarization singularities (PSs) have attracted extensive attention due to their capability to retain topological invariance during propagation. Many advances in PS research have been made over the past 20 years in the areas of mathematical description, generation and detection technologies, propagation dynamics, and applications. However, one of the most crucial and difficult tasks continues to be manipulating PSs with multiple degrees of freedom, especially in three-dimensional (3D) tailored optical fields. We propose and demonstrate the longitudinal PS lines obtained by superimposing Bessel-like modes with orthogonal polarization states on composite vector optical fields (VOFs). The embedded PSs in the fields can be manipulated to propagate robustly along arbitrary trajectories, or to annihilate, revive, and transform each other at on-demand positions in 3D space, allowing complex PS' topological morphology and intensity patterns to be flexibly customized. Our findings could spur further research into singular optics and help with applications such as micromanipulation, microstructure fabrication, and optical encryption. (c) 2022 Chinese Laser Press

ABSTRACT: Magnetic Skyrmions are topologically protected spin structures with sophisticated swirls of electron spins. In recent times, photonic counterparts of the magnetic Skyrmions have been discovered with new deep-subwavelength characteristics promising for future applications in optical information storage and transfer. While the photonic Skyrmions in real space have been observed in diverse photonic systems, studies on the photonic Skyrmions in momentum space have rarely been done. Here we show different forms of pseudospin Skyrmion around the Dirac point in momentum space of photonic crystals with the Kagome and honeycomb lattice. The pseudospin Skyrmions in momentum space are directly related to the topologically nontrivial states and manipulated by the inter-cell and intra-cell interactions between cylinders of the photonic crystal. The observation of the pseudospin Skyrmion in momentum space is expected to be valuable for manipulation of the flows and polarizations of light in topologically robust ways.

ABSTRACT: The quest for identification and understanding of fractional vorticity is a major subject of research in the quantum fluids domain, ranging from superconductors, superfluid Helium-3 to cold atoms. In a two-dimensional Bose degenerate gas with a spin degree of freedom, the fundamental topological excitations are fractional vortical entities, called half-quantum vortices. Convincing evidence for the existence of half-quantum vortices was recently provided in spinor polariton condensates. The half-quantum vortices can be regarded as the fundamental structural components of singly charged vortices but, so far, no experimental evidence of this relation has been provided. Here we report on the direct and time-resolved observation of the dynamical process of the dissociation of a singly charged vortex into its primary components, a pair of half-quantum vortices. The physical origin of the observed phenomenology is found in a spatially inhomogeneous static potential that couples the two spin components of the condensate.

ABSTRACT: The modified uplink and downlink atmospheric turbulence channel models were established and employed to assess the system performance of air-ground orbital angular momentum (OAM) communication. The advantage of the vector vortex beam taking the place of the scalar one in the OAM communication system operated in the atmospheric turbulence was verified, that vector vortex beam can guarantee the more homogeneous energy in the circular hollow beam profile and the less phase distortion on signal OAM in the turbulence, which can reduce OAM crosstalk and improve OAM communication performance, especially small topological charge in strong turbulent regime. With the increase in turbulence strength, the vortex beam with a larger topological charge suffered more OAM mode crosstalk, and the average BER of the OAM communication system increased. Bessel-Gaussian (BG) beams with larger beam shape parameters had the strong capability of turbulence disturbance rejection in short-distance atmospheric applications, conversely, Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beams with suitable parameter selection were preferred for long-distance atmospheric applications. Additionally, compared to the downlink channel, the transmission of OAM mode and the related communication system in the uplink channel are dramatically deteriorated due to atmospheric turbulent effects.

ABSTRACT: The spatially resolved electrical response of polycrystalline NiOx films, composed of 40 nm crystallites, was investigated under different relative humidity (RH) levels. The topological and electrical properties (surface potential and resistance) were characterized with sub-25-nm resolution using Kelvin probe force microscopy and conductive scanning probe microscopy under argon atmosphere with 0%, 50%, and 80% RH. The dimensionality of surface features obtained through autocorrelation analysis of topological maps increased linearly with increased RH, as water was adsorbed onto the film surface. Surface potential decreased from 280 to 100 mV and resistance decreased from 5 G Omega to 3 G Omega, in a nonlinear fashion when RH was increased from 0% to 80%. Spatially resolved surface potential and resistance of the NiOx films was found to be heterogeneous throughout the film, with distinct surface features that grew in size from 60 to 175 nm at 0% and 80% RH levels, respectively. The heterogeneous character of the topological, surface potential, and resistance properties of the polycrystalline NiOx film observed under dry conditions decreased with increased RH, yielding nearly homogeneous surface properties at 80% RH, suggesting that the nanoscale potential and resistance properties converge with the mesoscale properties as water is adsorbed onto the NiOx film.

ABSTRACT: We study a one-dimensional system of strongly correlated bosons on a dynamical lattice. To this end, we extend the standard Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian to include extra degrees of freedom on the bonds of the lattice. We show that this minimal model exhibits phenomena reminiscent of fermion-phonon models. In particular, we discover a bosonic analog of the Peierls transition, where the translational symmetry of the underlying lattice is spontaneously broken. This provides a dynamical mechanism to obtain a topological insulator in the presence of interactions, analogous to the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model for electrons. We characterize the phase diagram numerically, showing different types of bond order waves and topological solitons. Finally, we study the possibility of implementing the model using atomic systems.

ABSTRACT: A theoretical model, suitable for multiple structures of integrated vortex beam emitters, is proposed, developed and verified. Using the interference superposition of multiple plane waves in the far-field plane, which have the same wavevector in the z-direction, the expressions of the orbital angular momentum (OAM) beam field emitted from integrated devices are obtained. The results are applicable to OAM beams with larger or fractional topological charges, and consider different initial polarization states, which means different structures. Especially, when theta = 0, p = 0, the result is the same as those derived from the dipole model and is consistent with the previous experimental results. The calculated results show that it can obtain more accurate far-field light field with topological charge l increasing gradually and gain the same Ex and Ey with different initial polarization states. By constructing this model, the generation mechanism of the integrated OAM beam emitters can be easily understood and the beam vortex can be generated naturally and flexibly.

ABSTRACT: Within the framework of perturbation theory, we explore in detail the mixing of orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes due to a fiber bend in a step-index multimode fiber. Using a scalar wave equation, we develop a complete set of analytic expressions for mode-mixing, including those for the 2 pi walk-off length, which is the distance traveled within the bent fiber before an OAM mode transforms into its negative topological charge counterpart, and back into itself. The derived results provide insight into the nature of the bend effects, clearly revealing the mathematical dependence on the bend radius and the topological charge. We numerically simulate the theoretical results with applications to a few-mode fiber and a multimode fiber, and calculate bend-induced modal crosstalk with implications for mode-multiplexed systems. The presented perturbation technique is general enough to be applicable to other perturbations like ellipticity and easily extendable to other fibers with step-index-like profile as in the ring fiber.

ABSTRACT: In this work, we present patterned water-responsive coatings, which alter both their topological and optical properties. The polymer coatings are based on a hydrogen-bonded cholesteric liquid crystalline polymer network. A two-step photopolymerization procedure leads to a patterned coating with repeating liquid crystalline and isotropic areas. The cholesteric liquid crystalline areas reflect green light, whilst the isotropic areas are transparent for visible light. Treatment with alkaline solution results in a hygroscopic polymer salt coating. When placed in demineralized water, the polymer films swells, leading to an enhancement of the surface topography structure in which the liquid crystalline areas swell more. Moreover, the pitch of the helical organization in the cholesteric areas increases due to this swelling leading to a color change from green to red.

ABSTRACT: We have experimentally created perfect vortex beams (PVBs) by Fourier transformation of Bessel-Gaussian vortex beams, which are generated by modulating the fundamental Gaussian beam with the spiral phase plates and the axicons, respectively. Although the method has been used many times by other authors, as far as we know, few people pay attention to the quantitative relationship between the control parameters of the PVB and ring width. The effects of the waist radius of the fundamental Gaussian beam wg, base angle of the axicon gamma, and focal length of the lens f on the spot parameters (ring radius rho, and ring half-width Delta) of PVB are systematically studied. The beam pattern of the generated Bessel-Gaussian beam for different propagation distances behind the axicon and the fundamental Gaussian beam wg is presented. We showed experimentally that the ring radius rho increases linearly with the increase of the base angle gamma and focal length f, while the ring half-width Delta decreases with the increase of the fundamental beam waist radius wg, and increases with enlarging the focal length f. We confirmed the topological charge (TC) of the PVB by the interferogram between the PVB and the reference fundamental Gaussian beam. We also studied experimentally that the size of the generated PVB in the Fourier plane is independent of the TCs. Our approach to generate the PVB has the advantages of high-power tolerance and high efficiency.

ABSTRACT: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is used for diagnosis of esophageal diseases such as Bar rett's esophagus. Given the large volume of OCT data acquired, automated analysis is needed. Here we propose a bilateral connectivity-based neural network for in vivo human esophageal OCT layer segmentation. Our method, connectivity-based CE-Net (Bicon-CE), defines layer segmentation as a combination of pixel connectivity modeling and pixel-wise tissue classification. Bicon-CE outperformed other widely used neural networks and reduced common topological prediction issues in tissues from healthy patients and from patients with Bar rett's esophagus. This is the first end-to-end learning method developed for automatic segmentation of the epithelium in in vivo human esophageal OCT images.

ABSTRACT: Using Richards-Wolf formulas, we show that an axisymmetric circularly polarized vortex-free field can be focused into a sharp subwavelength focal spot, around which there is a region where the light energy flow propagates along a spiral. This effect can be explained by the conversion of the spin angular momentum of the circularly polarized field into the orbital angular momentum near the focus, although the on-axis orbital angular momentum remains zero. It is also shown that a linearly polarized optical vortex with topological charge 2 forms near the focal plane an on-axis reverse energy flow (defined by the negative longitudinal component of the Poynting vector) whose amplitude is comparable with the direct energy flow.

ABSTRACT: The combinatorial-topological analysis and simulation of the self-assembly of the Na32Au44In24-oP100 (space group P bcm, a = 5.483 angstrom, b = 24.519 angstrom, c = 14.573 angstrom, V = 1895 angstrom(3)) crystal structure are conducted by the computer-based methods (TOPOS program package). A new type of the 12-atom K12 cluster formed from doubled pentagonal pyramids-AuAu5 and InNa5-is established. The maximal symmetry of the K12 cluster and the primary chain of translationally bound K12 clusters correspond to the noncrystallographic 5m symmetry. The symmetry and topological codes of the Na32Au44In24-oP100 3D structure's self-assembly processes from the K12 nanocluster precursors are reconstructed in the following form: primary chain -> microlayer -> micro-framework. The primary chains of bound K12 clusters with the m symmetry are located in the direction [100], and the distance between cluster centers determines the vector's value: a = 5.483 angstrom. There are four nonparallel primary chains in the primary chain's local environment. The chains from InAu atoms and NaAu2In2 clusters are located in the 2D layer between the primary chains. The distance between the equivalent chains in the direction [001] determined the vector's value: c = 14.573 angstrom. In the 3D framework in the direction [010], the distance between the equivalent 2D layers determined the vector's value: b = 24.519 angstrom.

ABSTRACT: We propose a new type of a mid-infrared ultra-compact optical modulator composed of a graphene metasurface. Unlike the previously proposed schemes based on loss variation of materials or interference, the proposed one utilizes the unique topological characteristic of the isofrequency contour in the hyperbolic metasurface to modulate the transmission. The designed modulator provides a modulation depth of 10.7 dB, the length of which is 750 nm, corresponding to similar to 1/30 of an operating wavelength.

ABSTRACT: The Berry curvature is a geometrical property of an energy band which acts as a momentum space magnetic field in the effective Hamiltonian describing single-particle quantum dynamics. We show how this perspective may be exploited to study systems directly relevant to ultracold gases and photonics. Given the exchanged roles of momentum and position, we demonstrate that the global topology of momentum space is crucially important. We propose an experiment to study the Harper-Hofstadter Hamiltonian with a harmonic trap that will illustrate the advantages of this approach and that will also constitute the first realization of magnetism on a torus.

ABSTRACT: In this paper, small plasmonic nanobumps, which consist of metal/dielectric layers are placed on the ring of optical vortex to enhance electric field ampltiude. In this paper, a plasmonic nanobump is placed on the ring of smaller optical vortex. The smaller optical vortex form from the resultant topological phase between the handedness of the incident circular polarized light and the nanoslits spiral. Different designs of plasmonic nanobump are investigated, and tapered nanobump produced higher field enhancement due to higher surface charge density at the tapering end. Higher field intensity at the tip of the plasmonic nanobump produces lower potential, which attract nanoparticle to the region. The optical force increases by the square of the electric field amplitude. This high electric field intensity at the plasmonic nanobump functions as attractive node, which trap molecules inside the optical vortex. Additional plasmonic nanobumps are added onto the other locations of the optical vortex to manipulate the particle trapping positions. This allows the precise control of molecule's position and movement for imaging, characterization and analysis, which is useful for mobile lab-on-chip devices.

ABSTRACT: Aiming at tightly focusing vector polarized partially coherent vortex laser beams, this paper introduced a new kind of vortex beams, named radially polarized multi-Gaussian Schell-model (MGSM) power-exponent-phase vortex beam (PEPVB). Based on the vectorial diffraction theory, this work theoretically and numerically investigated the tight focusing properties of radially polarized MGSMPEPVB passing through a high numerical aperture objective lens. Thus, we analyzed the impact of topological charge, power exponent, beam index and coherence length on the intensity of focal zone. We discovered that by increasing beam index, the intensity distribution of focal plane gradually changed from Gaussian to flat-top. Especially, when the power exponent was a non-negative fraction close to 1, regardless of whether the topological charge was an integer or not, the circular symmetry of the focused spot at focal plane would be destroyed, showing a non-uniform and asymmetric central dark core optical intensity distribution. Besides, the value of the fractional part of the topological charge would make the hollow structure of the central dark core fully open due to the introduction of power-exponent phase, which is an improvement over the tight focusing properties of radially polarized MGSM vortex beams. This work has clearly demonstrated that by changing the values of topological charge, power exponent, beam index and coherence length, the special focal spot structures with different intensity distributions including flat-top beam and irregular hollow beam can be obtained, which have many potential applications in laser machining and particle capturing such as manipulation of certain irregular microparticles.

ABSTRACT: We reported on the femtosecond pulse generation from an erbium-doped fiber (EDF) laser by using microfiber-based gold nanorods (GNRs) as saturable absorber (SA). By virtue of the geometric characteristic of microfiber-based GNRs, the optical damage threshold of GNRs-SA could be greatly enhanced. The microfiber-based GNRs-SA shows a modulation depth of 4.9% and a nonsaturable loss of 21.1%. With the proposed GNRs-SA, the fiber laser emitted a mode-locked pulse train with duration of similar to 887 fs. The obtained results demonstrated that the GNRs deposited microfiber could indeed serve as a high-performance SA towards the practical applications in the field of ultrafast photonics.

ABSTRACT: Using the quasiclassical concept of Berry curvature we demonstrate that a Dirac exciton-a pair of Dirac quasiparticles bound by Coulomb interactions-inevitably possesses an intrinsic angular momentum making the exciton effectively self-rotating. The model is applied to excitons in two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides, in which the charge carriers are known to be described by a Dirac-like Hamiltonian. We show that the topological self-rotation strongly modifies the exciton spectrum and, as a consequence, resolves the puzzle of the overestimated two-dimensional polarizability employed to fit earlier spectroscopic measurements.

ABSTRACT: To accurately unwrap the high-order orbital angular momentum (OAM) for multiplexed vortex beams is a challenge. In this work, over +/- 160 order OAM topological charges have been unwrapped in multiplexed optical links. Optical imaging based discrepancy identification enables the multiplexed OAM modes separating in physics, and the intelligent pattern recognition further promotes its unwrapping in numerical domain. Particularly, the combination of annular phase grating and auxiliary beams features compound spiral stripes, which paves the way for optical intensity recognition with low-complexity and high-commonality. Moreover, the spiral direction characterizes the symbol of the OAM states, which dramatically broadens the amount of multiplexed links. Here, optical separating means assisted by intelligent pattern recognition opens up a new route to high-speed and large-capacity optical communication, which may shed new light on 6G application.

ABSTRACT: The diffraction of elegant vortex hypergeometric (HyG) laser beams with a parabolic initial wavefront in a homogeneous medium is considered. While HyG beams have a central amplitude singularity in the initial plane and are of infinite energy, the superposition of two such beams has no singularity and is of finite energy. A particular case of this superposition, i.e., a sinusoidal Gaussian beam with a unit topological charge, is studied in detail. This beam belongs to the class of elegant laser beams since it is described by the same complex-argument function both in the initial plane and in the Fresnel diffraction zone.

ABSTRACT: In this paper, we investigate the propagation properties of four-petal Gaussian vortex (FPGV) beams propagating through the quadratic index medium, obtaining the analytical expression of FPGV beams. The effects of beam order n, topological charge m and beam waist omega(0) are investigated. Results show that quadratic index medium support periodic distributions of FPGV beams. A hollow optical wall or an optical central principal maximum surrounded by symmetrical sidelobes will occur at the center of a period. At length, they will evolve into four petals structure, exactly same as the intensity distributions at source plane. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Light beams with optical vortices can propagate in free space only with integer orbital angular momentum. Herein, this scientific consensus theoretically and experimentally is upheaved by proposing light beams carrying natural noninteger orbital angular momentum. These peculiar vortex beams are unique solutions to the Helmholtz equation, which possesses optical vortices with topological charges of l + 0.5, where l is an integer. During propagation in free space, their amplitudes and vortex phases with noninteger topological charges can be maintained stably. The findings of this study provide an alternative state of optical vortices in physics, which can serve as basis for innovations in optics and related scientific fields.

ABSTRACT: Chiral circularly polarized (CP) light is central to many photonic technologies, from the optical communication of spin information to novel display and imaging technologies. As such, there has been significant effort in the development of chiral emissive materials that enable the emission of strongly dissymmetric CP light from organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). It has been widely accepted that the molecular chirality of the active layer determines the favoured light handedness of the CP emission in such devices, regardless of the light-emitting direction. Here we discover that, unconventionally, oppositely propagating CP light exhibits opposite handedness, and reversing the current flow in OLEDs also switches the handedness of the emitted CP light. This direction-dependent CP emission boosts the net polarization rate by orders of magnitude by resolving an established issue in CP-OLEDs, where the CP light reflected by the back electrode typically erodes the measured dissymmetry. Through detailed theoretical analysis, we assign this anomalous CP emission to a ubiquitous topological electronic property in chiral materials, namely orbital-momentum locking. Our work paves the way to design new chiroptoelectronic devices and probes the close connections between chiral materials, topological electrons and CP light in the quantum regime.

ABSTRACT: Vortex beam carrying multiple orbital angular momentum provides a new degree of freedom to manipulate light leading to the various exciting applications as trapping, quantum optics, information multiplexing, etc. Helical wavefront can be generated either via the geometric or the dynamic phase arising from a space-variant birefringence (q-plate) or from phase accumulation through propagation (spiral-phase-plate), respectively. Using fast direct laser writing technique we fabricate and characterize novel hybrid q-plate generating vortex beam simultaneously carrying two different high-order topological charges, which arise from the spin-orbital conversion and the azimuthal height variation of the recorded structures. We approve the versatile concept to generate multiple-OAM. vortex beams combining the spin-orbital interaction and the phase accumulation in a single micro-scale device, a hybrid dielectric phase plate.

ABSTRACT: Based on the transfer-matrix method (TMM), we report the characteristics of the interface states in one-dimensional (1D) composite structures consisting of two photonic crystals (PCs) composed of bi-nary dielectrics A and B, with unit-cell configurations ABA (PC I) and BAB (PC II). The dependence of the interface states on the number of unit cells N and the boundary factor x are displayed. It is verified that the interface states are independent of N when the PC has inversion symmetry (x = 0.5). Besides, the composite structures support the formation of interface states independent of the PC symmetry, ex-cept that the positions of the interface states will be varied within the photonic band gaps. Moreover, the robustness of the interface states against nonuniformities is investigated by adding Gaussian noise to the layer thickness. In the case of inversion symmetry (x = 0.5) the most robust interface states are achieved, while for the other cases (x not equal 0.5) interface states decay linearly with position inside the band gap. This work could shed light on the development of robust photonic devices.

ABSTRACT: From atomic crystals to animal flocks, the emergence of order in nature is captured by the concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking(1-4). However, this cornerstone of physics is challenged when broken symmetry phases are frustrated by geometrical constraints. Such frustration dictates the behaviour of systems as diverse as spin ices(5-8), confined colloidal suspensions(9) and crumpled paper sheets(10). These systems typically exhibit strongly degenerated and heterogeneous ground states and hence escape the Ginzburg-Landau paradigm of phase ordering. Here, combining experiments, simulations and theory we uncover an unanticipated form of topological order in globally frustrated matter: non-orientable order. We demonstrate this concept by designing globally frustrated metamaterials that spontaneously break a discrete Z(2) symmetry. We observe that their equilibria are necessarily heteregeneous and extensively degenerated. We explain our observations by generalizing the theory of elasticity to non-orientable order-parameter bundles. We show that non-orientable equilibria are extensively degenerated due to the arbitrary location of topologically protected nodes and lines where the order parameter must vanish. We further show that non-orientable order applies more broadly to objects that are non-orientable themselves, such as buckled Mobius strips and Klein bottles. Finally, by applying time-dependent local perturbations to metamaterials with non-orientable order, we engineer topologically protected mechanical memories(11-19), achieve non-commutative responses and show that they carry an imprint of the braiding of the loads' trajectories. Beyond mechanics, we envision non-orientability as a robust design principle for metamaterials that can effectively store information across scales, in fields as diverse as colloidal science(8), photonics(20), magnetism(7) and atomic physics(21).

ABSTRACT: Due to the manifestation of fascinating physical phenomena and materials science, two-dimensional (2D) materials have recently attracted enormous research interest with respect to the fields of electronics and optoelectronics. There have been in-depth investigations of the nonlinear properties with respect to saturable absorption, and many 2D materials show potential application in optical switches for passive pulsed lasers. However, the Eigen band-gap determines the responding wavelength band and constrains the applications. In this paper, based on band-gap engineering, some different types of 2D broadband saturable absorbers are reviewed in detail, including molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), vanadium dioxide (VO2), graphene, and the Bi2Se3 topological insulator. The results suggest that the band-gap modification should play important roles in 2D broadband saturable materials and can provide some inspiration for the exploration and design of 2D nanodevices.

ABSTRACT: The demand for high capacity and integration in modern optical communication technology is becoming prominent. Orbital angular momentum (OAM) plays an important role in optical communication. However, there are still challenges to further expand the flexibility and capacity of optical communication in the axial direction. Here, we propose a single-layer liquid crystal device (LCD) to realize the generation of optical vortex (OV) array with arbitrary topological charge in axial multiplane, which can be applied in optical communications based on highly integrated device. The phase of the target OV array is weighted and superimposed to obtain the phase distribution of LCD. In order to obtain an OV array with uniform intensity, it is necessary to determine the optimal weight factor for each OV based on the introduced particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. In the experiment, a LCD with an effective aperture of 2 mm was processed. A CCD captures the OV array image, including two OV arrays at 200*lambda (156 mu m) in front of and behind the focal point respectively. Then, the beam passes through the 4f system of the spatial light modulator with the phase distribution of the Damman vortex grating on the spectrum plane, and the topological charge of the two OV arrays can be detected by the CCD. Our results provide an approach that based on a single liquid crystal plate, OV arrays in multiple propagation planes are realized, in which the number of propagation planes and the position of each propagation plane relative to the back focal plane can be adjusted arbitrarily, and the number, order, and position of OVs in each propagation plane can also be adjusted arbitrarily to meet the application requirements in the field of short-distance optical communication.

ABSTRACT: The second-harmonic spatiotemporal orbital angular momentum of an optical pulse and its space-time topological charge conservation during frequency doubling are experimentally observed, opening opportunities for nonlinear conversion and scaling of photons carrying spatiotemporal orbital angular momentum. Light with spatiotemporal orbital angular momentum (ST-OAM) is a recently discovered type of structured and localized electromagnetic field. This field carries characteristic space-time spiral phase structure and transverse intrinsic OAM. Here, we present the generation and characterization of the second harmonic of ST-OAM pulses. We uncover the conservation of transverse OAM in a second-harmonic generation process, where the space-time topological charge of the fundamental field is doubled along with the optical frequency. Our experiment thus suggests a general ST-OAM nonlinear scaling rule, analogous to that in conventional OAM of light. Furthermore, we observe that the topology of a second-harmonic ST-OAM pulse can be modified by complex spatiotemporal astigmatism, giving rise to multiple phase singularities separated in space and time. Our study opens a new route for nonlinear conversion and scaling of light carrying ST-OAM, with the potential for driving other secondary ST-OAM sources of electromagnetic fields and beyond.

ABSTRACT: The geometric and topological analyses of the K44In80-hR366 (space group R (3) over bar, a = b = 17.214 angstrom, c = 44.612 angstrom) and K34In82-cF464 (space group Fd (3) over barm, a = 24.241 angstrom, V = 14244.64 angstrom(3)) crystal structures are implemented by computer-based methods (ToposPro program). The framework-forming 142-atom icosahedral nanocluster K142 is determined by the method of the complete decomposition of the 3D atomic network of the K44In80 intermetallide into cluster structures. The K142 nanoclusters with the symmetry (3) over bar are three-layer with the shell composition of 0@12In@32(K26In6)@98(K26In72). The first two shells form the Bergman cluster. The third shell of 98 atoms is formed by 5-, 6-, and 7-atom rings (5(54).6(38).7(6)) and contained 98 apexes, 270 edges, and 174 faces. The K142 nanoclusters form closely packed two-dimensional layers 3(6) located with a shift along [001]. The distance between the K142 cluster centers determines the translation vector value a(hex) = 17.214 angstrom. Voids in the 3D framework are occupied by 0@K6In2 spacers. Suprapolyhedral clusters K141 with the symmetry -43mcomprising four Bergman clusters 0@12In@32 (K20In12), each of which have the symmetry (3) over barm, are formed in the K34In82 intermetallide. Voids in the 3D framework are occupied by In(In-4) spacers in the form of tetrahedra with the central atom In, which have the symmetry of -43m. For the K44In80 and K34In82 intermetallides, the symmetric and topological code for the self-assembly processes of the 3D structure from nanocluster precursors K142 and K141 is determined in the following form: primary chain -> layer -> framework.

ABSTRACT: Light fields carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) offer a broad variety of applications in which especially an accurate determination of the respective OAM spectrum, i.e., unraveling the content of OAM by its topological charge l, has become a main subject. Even though various techniques have been proposed to measure the OAM spectrum of such modes, many of them fail if optical vortices have to be considered in perturbed or dynamically changing experimental systems. Here, we put forward a novel technique capable of determining the OAM spectrum of light by a single measurement shot, which specifically applies to those fields that have been distorted. Experimentally, our technique only requires to interfere the perturbed light field with a reference field. From the resulting intensity pattern, the accurate OAM spectrum is determined in an all-digital way. We demonstrate our novel approach by numerical simulations and a proof-of-concept experiment employing a model ball lens as an exemplary disturbing object.

ABSTRACT: According to the paraxial theory, we analyzed the linear momentum density and orbital angular momentum (OAM) the propagation characteristics of a Gaussian vortex beam in free space. The propagation characteristics are simulated and analyzed in the visualization. Further, we study the variation of the propagation characteristics with different topological charges. In addition, we also analyzed the position of momentum in the transverse profile, where the momentum density of the spot will be broadened with propagation distance. This study can provide guidance for using vortex beams in optical communication and manipulation.

ABSTRACT: For structurally stable laser beams whose amplitude can be represented as a finite sum of the Hermite-Gaussian functions with undefined weight coefficients, we obtain an analytical expres-sion for the normalized orbital angular momentum (OAM) that is also expressed through finite sums of weight coefficients. It is shown that a certain choice of weight coefficients allows obtain-ing the maximal OAM, which is equal to the maximal index of the Hermite polynomial in the sum. In this case, the sum describes a single-ringed Laguerre-Gaussian beam with a topological charge equal to the maximal OAM and to the maximal order of the Hermite polynomial.

ABSTRACT: The machine learning technique of persistent homology classifies complex systems or datasets by computing their topological features over a range of characteristic scales. There is growing interest in applying persistent homology to characterize physical systems such as spin models and multiqubit entangled states. Here, we propose persistent homology as a tool for characterizing and optimizing band structures of periodic photonic media. Using the honeycomb photonic lattice Haldane model as an example, we show how persistent homology is able to reliably classify a variety of band structures falling outside the usual paradigms of topological band theory, including moat band and multi-valley dispersion relations, and thereby control the properties of quantum emitters embedded in the lattice. The method is promising for the automated design of more complex systems such as photonic crystals and Moire superlattices.

ABSTRACT: In this study, a new method for manipulating energy flow in a 3D vector field is proposed. In this method, an azimuthally-polarized beam with a noncanonical vortex, the X-type vortex, is focused in a high-numerical aperture system. It is found that, instead of the invariance of the energy flow which is characteristic of the traditional vortex (i.e., canonical vortex), both the longitudinal and the transverse energy flows in virtue of the X-type vortex rotate around the beam center as the beam propagates, and this rotational behavior (including the maxima location and the rotational angle) can be adjusted by the anisotropic parameter and the order the X-type vortex. Through defining a complex transverse Poynting field and applying the equivalence principle, the transverse energy flow and its topological reactions are discussed in the focal plane. Our result shows that, by changing the anisotropic parameter of the X-type vortex, rich topological reactions will occur, resulting in various distribution patterns of the energy flow, such as multi vortex-type singularities around the beam center. Our research demonstrates newly-observed features of the X-type vortex and also provides a simple method to manipulate energy flows both along longitudinal and transverse directions, which will be useful in optical manipulations.

ABSTRACT: In recent years, novel two-dimensional materials such as graphene, bismuthene, and transition-metal dichalcogenides have attracted considerable interest due to their unique physical properties. However, certain lattice geometries, such as the Lieb lattice, do not exist as atomic monolayers. Fortunately, a range of physical effects can be transferred to the realms of photonics by creating artificial photonic lattices emulating these two-dimensional materials. Here, exciton-polaritons in semiconductor microcavities offer an exciting opportunity to study a part-light, part-matter quantum fluid of light in a complex lattice potential. In this Rapid Communication, we study exciton-polaritons in a two-dimensional Lieb lattice of buried optical traps. The S and P-xy photonic orbitals of such a Lieb lattice give rise to the formation of two flatbands which are of greatest interest for the distortion-free storage of compact localized states. By using a well controlled etch-and-overgrowth technique, we manage to control the trapping as well as the site couplings with great precision. This allows us to spectroscopically monitor the flatness of the flatbands across the full Brillouin zone. Furthermore, we demonstrate experimentally that these flatbands can be directly populated by condensation under nonresonant laser excitation. Finally, using this advanced device approach we demonstrate resonant and deterministic excitation of flatband modes in transmission geometry. Our findings establish the exciton-polariton systems as a highly controllable, optical many-body system to study flatband effects and for distortion-free storage of compact localized states.

ABSTRACT: The achievement of cylindrical vector beam (CVB) multiplexing has shown advantages in enlarging communication capacities and all-optical interconnections. While various mode transformation technologies have been developed to process CVB multiplexing signals, previous approaches have failed to cross-connect CVB channels, which could play a pivotal role in all-optical interconnection. Since CVBs can be decomposed into two orthogonal circularly polarized vortex beams with opposite topological charges, it is possible to cross-connect CVB channels via spin-dependent orbital angular momentum mode cross-transformation. Exploiting the spin-orbit interaction of photons in anisotropic liquid crystal q-plates, we performed conjugate helical phase modulations to these two spin components using the local polarization conversion of the birefringent effect, where the conjugate relationship of the two spin components was maintained during the transformation. Constrained by the spin-dependent phase modulation, the spatially separated target CVB mode was independently transformed with other higher-order modes via the partitioned modulation of the liquid crystal q-plate for CVB mode cross-transformation. As a proof of concept, a three-channel CVB multiplexing communication system was constructed. We show that the data signals between two CVB channels were successfully cross-connected, and 150 Gbit/s quadrature phase-shift keying signals were transmitted with a bit-error-rate approaching 1 x 10(-6).

ABSTRACT: Non-Hermitian degeneracies, also known as exceptional points, have recently emerged as a new way to engineer the response of open physical systems, that is, those that interact with the environment. They correspond to points in parameter space at which the eigenvalues of the underlying system and the corresponding eigenvectors simultaneously coalesce(1-3). In optics, the abrupt nature of the phase transitions that are encountered around exceptional points has been shown to lead to many intriguing phenomena, such as loss-induced transparency(4), unidirectional invisibility(5,6), band merging(7,8), topological chirality(9,10) and laser mode selectivity(11,12). Recently, it has been shown that the bifurcation properties of second-order non-Hermitian degeneracies can provide a means of enhancing the sensitivity (frequency shifts) of resonant optical structures to external perturbations(13). Of particular interest is the use of even higher-order exceptional points (greater than second order), which in principle could further amplify the effect of perturbations, leading to even greater sensitivity. Although a growing number of theoretical studies have been devoted to such higher-order degeneracies(14-16), their experimental demonstration in the optical domain has so far remained elusive. Here we report the observation of higher-order exceptional points in a coupled cavity arrangement-specifically, a ternary, parity-time-symmetric photonic laser molecule-with a carefully tailored gain-loss distribution. We study the system in the spectral domain and find that the frequency response associated with this system follows a cube-root dependence on induced perturbations in the refractive index. Our work paves the way for utilizing non-Hermitian degeneracies in fields including photonics, optomechanics(10), microwaves(9) and atomic physics(17,18).

ABSTRACT: We present optical vortex beams interaction via degenerate two-wave mixing in liquid crystal light-valve, LCLV. The LCLV is made by combining a transparent photosensitive substrate with a nematic liquid crystal and displays a large Kerr-like effect. Being characterized by a large transverse size and spatial homogeneity, the LCLV allows performing nonlinear mixing experiments with several vortex beams and testing the interaction of different topological charges. We show that the wave-mixing occurring in the LCLV leads to the exchange of topological charge between vortex and to a cascaded generation of vortex beams. A mean-field model is developed and is shown to account for the charge selection rules observed after the mixing process. Fractional charges are demonstrated to participate to the wave-mixing in a robust way, following the same charge selection rules as for integer charges.

ABSTRACT: A mid-infrared saturable absorber mirror is successfully fabricated by transferring the mechanically exfoliated black phosphorus onto the gold-coated mirror. With the as-prepared black phosphorus saturable absorber mirror, a continuous-wave passively mode-locked Er: ZBLAN fiber laser is demonstrated at the wavelength of 2.8 mu m, which delivers a maximum average output power of 613 mW, a repetition rate of 24 MHz, and a pulse duration of 42 ps. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a black phosphorus mode-locked laser at 2.8 mu m wavelength has been demonstrated. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of black phosphorus flake as a new two-dimensional material for application in mid-infrared ultrafast photonics. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America

ABSTRACT: Recently, the realization of the spiral mass transfer of matter has attracted the attention of many researchers. Nano- and microstructures fabricated with such mass transfer can be used for the generation of light with non-zero orbital angular momentum (OAM) or the sensing of chiral molecules. In the case of metals and semiconductors, the chirality of formed spiral-shaped microstructures depends on the topological charge (TC) of the illuminating optical vortex (OV) beam. The situation is quite different with polarization-sensitive materials such as azopolymers, azobenzene-containing polymers. Azopolymers show polarization-sensitive mass transfer both at the meso and macro levels and have huge potential in diffractive optics and photonics. Previously, only one-spiral patterns formed in thin azopolymer films using circularly polarized OV beams and double-spiral patterns formed using linearly polarized OV beams have been demonstrated. In these cases, the TC of the used OV beams did not affect the number of formed spirals. In this study, we propose to use two-beam (an OV and a Gaussian beam with a spherical wavefront) interference lithography for realization spiral mass transfer with the desired number of formed spirals. The TC of the OV beam allows for controlling the number of formed spirals. We show the microstructures fabricated by the laser processing of thin azopolymer films can be used for the generation of OAM light at the microscale with the desired TC. The experimentally obtained results are in good agreement with the numerically obtained results and demonstrate the potential of the use of such techniques for the laser material processing of polarization-sensitive materials.

ABSTRACT: When spinning particles, such as electrons and photons, undergo spin-orbit coupling, they can acquire an extra phase in addition to the well-known dynamical phase. This extra phase is called the geometric phase (also known as the Berry phase), which plays an important role in a startling variety of physical contexts such as in photonics, condensed matter, high-energy and space physics. The geometric phase was originally discussed for a cyclically evolving physical system with an Abelian evolution, and was later generalized to non-cyclic and non-Abelian cases, which are the most interesting fundamental subjects in this area and indicate promising applications in various fields. Here, we enable optical spin-orbit coupling in asymmetric microcavities and experimentally observe a non-cyclic optical geometric phase acquired in a non-Abelian evolution. Our work is relevant to fundamental studies and implies promising applications by manipulating photons in on-chip quantum devices.

ABSTRACT: Gallium sulfide (GaS), with a hexagonal structure, has received extensive attention due to its graphene-like structure and derived optical properties. Here, high-quality GaS was obtained via chemical vapor synthesis and then prepared as a saturable absorber by the stamp-assisted localization-transfer technique onto fiber end face. The stability of the material and the laser damage threshold are maintained due to the optimized thickness and the cavity integration form. The potential of the GaS for nonlinear optics is explored by constructing a GaS-based Erbium-doped mode-locked fiber laser. Stable femtosecond (~448 fs) mode-locking operation of the single pulse train is achieved, and the robust mode-locked operation (>30 days) was recorded. Experimental results show the potential of GaS for multi-functional ultrafast high-power lasers and promote continuous research on graphene-like materials in nonlinear optics and photonics.

ABSTRACT: Wavefront shaping of structured light beams is attracting considerable attention in optics and related technologies. Due to the potential benefits, it is crucial to develop versatile methods for controlling the wavefront in a compact space with the capacity for high-throughput parallel processing. Herein, a unique concept is introduced for converting the wavefront of multiple structured light beams, which are periodically packed in a microscopic area. An experimental demonstration is provided by using transmissive planar optical elements consisting of a microarray of geometric phase based on nematic liquid crystals. The periodic microstructure is fabricated by the directed self-organization of topological defects present in a nanoscale relief obtained by area-selective surface modification. The conversion of multiple wavefronts is realized by using the Talbot self-imaging effect of the microarray. The integrated geometric phase microarray has potential applications in vortex beam emitters to harness structured light, such as for optical manipulation and lithography.

ABSTRACT: Based on the optical switch and fiber, the topological structure of optical fiber delay line(OFDL) was designed, two aspects were analyzed which have influence in precision of optical fiber delay line, that is the error of connection and the error caused by optical switch. In order to realize high precision of optical fiber delay line, a method was found to reduce the error caused by optical switch, by simulating, when the error caused by an optical switch is 1ps, the precision of optical fiber delay line can reach 2ps, and this method can be applied to any bit OFDL with arbitrary optical switches. Magneto optical switches and fiber were used to build a system of 5bit optical fiber delay line. The optimal topologic structure was adopted and the precision of the fiber delay line was measured up to 2.85ps.

ABSTRACT: The investigation of converged twisted beams with a helical phase structure has a remarkable impact on both fundamental physics and practical applications. Geometric metasurfaces consisting of individually orientated metal/dielectric meta-atoms provide an ultracompact platform for generating converged vortices. However, it is still challenging to simultaneously focus left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized incident beams with pure geometric phase modulation, which hinders the independent operation on topological charges between these two helical components. Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate an approach to design terahertz geometric metasurfaces that can generate helicity-independent converged vortices with homogeneous polarization states by the superposition of two orthogonal helical vortices with identical topological charges. Furthermore, the multiplexing of polarization-rotatable multiple vortices in multiple dimensions, i.e., in both longitudinal and transverse directions, and a vortex with an extended focal depth is confirmed by embedding polarization modulation into the geometric metasurfaces. The demonstrated approach provides a new way to simultaneously manipulate orthogonal helical components and expand the design dimension, enabling new applications of geometric metasurface devices in polarization optics, twisted-beam related image and edge detection, high capacity optical communication, and quantum information processing, to name a few.

ABSTRACT: The results of our investigations on direct laser fabrication of micro spiral phase plates (SPPs) in fused silica using the fluorine laser microstructuring technique will be presented. The process, which based on the mask projection technique, enables the generation of SPPs with different topological charges, handedness, modulation depths and level numbers. For this, a special double mask rotation system was developed, which allows the fabrication of micro SPPs with an individual configuration with regard to the mentioned parameters. Moreover, the phase of a spherical lens can be added to the helical phase of the SPP using a special mask geometry. Furthermore, we build up a measurement system for a first optical characterization of the fabricated SPPs.

ABSTRACT: "The rotational Doppler effect (RDE), as a counterpart of the conventional well-known linear Doppler effect in the rotating frame, has attracted increasing attention in recent years for rotating object detection. However, the effect of the beam size on the RDE is still an open question. In this article, we investigated the influence of the size of the probe light  i.e., the size of the ring-shaped orbital angular momentum (OAM)-carrying optical vortex (OV), on the RDE. Both the light coaxial and noncoaxial incident conditions were considered in our work. We analyzed the mechanism of the influence on the RDE under the light coaxial, lateral misalignment, and oblique incidence conditions based on the small-scatterer model. A proof-of-concept experiment was performed to verify the theoretical predictions. It was shown that both the signal-to-noise ratio and the frequency spectrum width were related to the OV size. The larger the beam size, the stronger the RDE signal observed in the practical detection. Especially in the lateral misalignment condition, the large OV size effectively reduced the signal spreading and enhanced the signal strength. These findings may be useful for practical application of the optical RDE in remote sensing and metrology."

ABSTRACT: Self-organization of radiation in random media is a key to controlling the optical energy flow and constitutes the basis of innovative cavity-free laser designs. Here, we theoretically demonstrate the existence of robust temporal dissipative soliton molecules in a graphene-based active disordered metamaterial. We observe that localized pulses with single and multiple peaks can coexist inside this metamaterial for a wide range of gain parameters, thereby exhibiting optical bistability. We further investigate the stability of such bound states under perturbation by analyzing their interaction force, finding stable tri-soliton molecule states with a periodically oscillating relative phase and a stable bi-soliton molecule. Our results offer a paradigm for mode-locking in active random metamaterials and pave the way for versatile applications such as multilevel encoding in optical communications, future designs of low-cost cavity-free lasers, and optical amplifiers.

ABSTRACT: In the present communication, the propagation characteristics of structured beams are experimentally investigated using the two types of atmospheric turbulence simulators. These structured beams are defined by encoding the multiple phase singularities of topological l= 2 at the predefined locations in a plane wavefront. To generate these beams, the computer simulated holograms are displayed on the phase-only spatial light modulator which is illuminated by the collimated laser beam. The effect of atmosphere like turbulence is induced in the beams by the two turbulence simulators of strengths, i.e. D/r(0) = 3.6 and 7.27 mm. The propagation performance parameters of these beams are estimated by analyzing the laser spot and the scintillation index.

ABSTRACT: Tailoring the spatial structure of light field in multiple degrees of freedom is a research hotspot in recent years. The topology of light field, as one of the most fascinating structures, such as vortex knots and links associated with the phase singularities, is evoking increasing attention both in fundamental research and practical application. Here, an all-dielectric metasurface device is proposed and experimentally demonstrated that can construct vortex knots and links in light field at the micro scale. These two distinct topological configurations can be switched by changing the incident polarization. Utilizing the digital holographic interference method, these topological configurations of vorticity lines are accurately characterized in three-dimensions, and the topology-preserving evolution of such ultra-small fields is demonstrated. These two classical configurations exemplify the capability of multichannel manipulating topology by compact metadevice. The work may promote the application of structured light filed at the micro scale and even the creation of other physical fields with ultra-small size.

ABSTRACT: Optical vortex is a type of structured beam with helical phase wavefronts that carry orbital-angular momentum (OAM) with different topological charge numbers. Optical vortex beams are of use in a wide range of areas ranging from communications to biomedical applications. In this letter, we demonstrate that microscale polymer spiral phase plates (SPPs) with different topological charges can be fabricated through two-photon polymerization by femtosecond 3D direct laser writing. These micro-optical SPPs can modify input light beams carrying no OAM into optical vortex beams carrying an OAM of 1h per photon. Intensity patterns and interferograms of the vortex beams are experimentally obtained, showing good agreement with numerical simulations. The two-photon direct laser writing technique with a high resolution of 100 nm enables easy fabrication of micro-optic devices such as SPPs with broad applications in mesoscale photonic devices.

ABSTRACT: A polygon-like light-arm zone plate (PLZP) is proposed to generate the polygon-like light-arm beam, whose arms are identified clearly by using the appropriate transverse azimuthal shift phi. Moreover, phi has influence on the beam shape. The PLZP is based on the spiral phase plate of the topological charge l and the multiplexed vortex spiral phase plate of the topological charges l(1) and l(2). In addition, when the radius of the circular area for the filter is small or hig, the number of arms is vertical bar l(2) - l vertical bar or vertical bar l(1) - l vertical bar, respectively. Furthermore, when l(2) is positive or negative, the rotation direction of arms is clockwise or anticlockwise respectively. The proposed zone plates can be used to trap particles into different shapes, and applicable for optical communication.

ABSTRACT: With the growing channel demand in the interactive communication system, vortex beam with multi directions is of vital importance for high-efficiency communication. A chiral coding metamirror constructed with optically transparent material is proposed here to generate vortex beams carrying different topological charges in different directions. Dispersionless phase diagram covering 360 degrees is achieved based on the theory of Pancharatnam-Berry phase. The proposed metamirror unit has circular dichroism (CD) with near-perfect spin-selective absorption across a wideband and is insensitive to incident angle. Multi vortex beams can thus be selectively generated at the designated frequency, which avoid information interference. In addition, vortex beams with direction control are realized based on phase gradient mechanism.

ABSTRACT: Spatiotemporal optical vortices (STOVs) have attracted numerous attention from researchers in recent years due to their intriguing characteristics with transverse orbital angular momentum (OAM) in the spatiotemporal domain. In this work, we numerically analyze the tightly focusing characteristics of higher-order STOVs and present a method to dynamically modulate the transverse OAM in highly confined STOVs. Richards-Wolf vectorial diffraction theory was employed to simulate the three-dimensional spatiotemporal distribution of the focused STOV corresponding to the incident wave packet of topological charge of -2. The simulation results show that the higher-order spatiotemporal vortices in the transversely polarized components of the focused wave packets split into two first-order vortices with topological charge of -1 when the waist radius of the incident wave packet was larger than 40% of the pupil radius of the focusing lens, and the spacing of the two split vortices could be tailored by adjusting the waist radius of the incident wave packet. Meanwhile, the incident spatial waist radius also affected the tilt angle of the phase singularity trace in the z-polarized component of the focused field. The presented method provides a flexible way to dynamically engineer the spatiotemporal vortices in the tightly focused wave packet and may find potential applications in nanophotonics, light-matter interaction, quantum information processing, etc.

ABSTRACT: Cylindrical vector vortex (CVV) beam, which possesses both helical phase front and spatially inhomogeneous polarization, is a promising structured light for its various applications ranging from optical communication to optical field manipulation and optical microscopy. However, approaches to generate CVV beams with switchable and tunable polarization order and topological charge are still immature, which hinders the wide application of CVV beams. In this paper, we have experimentally demonstrated that order-controllable CVV beams can be produced by using spatial light modulator (SLM) and equivalent q-plate system at wavelength of 1550.8 nm. It is shown that the topological charge of the CVV beam can be switched by directly programming the SLM. We have also demonstrated that the polarization order of the CVV beam can be tuned to as high as eight by employing an equivalent q-plate system, which consists of two cascaded metasurfaces and a half-wave plate. To further verify the helical phase of the CVV beam, we have proposed a novel measurement method based on first removing the vector property and then interfering the remaining helical phase with plane wave or spherical wave.

ABSTRACT: We show theoretically that an astigmatic transformation of an edge dislocation (a straight line of zero intensity) of the n-th order forms n elliptical optical vortices (screw dislocations) with a unit topological charge at twice the focal distance from a cylindrical lens. The vortices are located on a straight line perpendicular to the edge dislocation at points with coordinates equal to the roots of an n-th order Hermite polynomial. The orbital angular momentum of an edge dislocation with an astigmatic phase is found to be proportional to n.

ABSTRACT: Investigation of the influence of parameters of silver, aluminum, gold, and chromium spiral zone plates on the longitudinal component of Umov-Pointing vector in produced optical vortices by using the frequency-dependent finite-difference time-domain method is presented. It is shown that the aluminum spiral zone plate with a relief height of 50 nm gives an optical vortex with the smallest longitudinal component of Umov-Pointing vector on the optical axis. The gold spiral zone plate is the least effective for the formation of vortex beams with a reverse energy flow.

ABSTRACT: Singularities of non-Hermitian systems typified by exceptional points (EPs) are critical for understanding non-Hermitian topological phases and trigger many intriguing phenomena. However, it remains unexplored what happens when EPs meet one another. Here, in a typical four-level model with both touching and crossing intersections of EP hypersurfaces, we report the interconversion mechanisms between EPs of different orders. By examining both the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, we show analytically that all EPs of higher orders are formed at the touching intersections of two different types of EP hypersurfaces of lower orders. Contrarily, the crossing intersection of EP structures lowers the order of EPs. The mechanisms of the increase and decrease in defectiveness discovered here are expected to hold for EPs of any order in various non-Hermitian systems, providing a comprehensive understanding of EPs and inspiration toward advanced applications such as biosensing and information processing.

ABSTRACT: Vortex excitations triggered by nonlinear interactions in Bose-Einstein condensates have attracted interest in the study of ultracold atoms. However, most studies focus on canonical vortex states with integer topological charges. In this paper, we study the dynamic properties of noncanonical vortex condensates with three phase distributions: power-exponent, new type power-exponent and oscillation type. The results show that the noncanonical vortices are dynamic unstable and their density distributions obviously depend on the phase parameters of the initial optical phase masks. Different noncanonical vortices decay into canonical clusters with diverse configurations showing rich topological excitation patterns. In particular, a new power exponential noncanonical vortex state decays into a stable canonical polygonal vortex cluster structure. Because the phase structures of the noncanonical optical vortices destroy the rotational symmetry of the condensate, the angular momentum of the condensate is no longer quantized, and its value changes with the power of the azimuthal angle of the optical field or the oscillation frequency, which is obviously different from the evolution of the corresponding noncanonical vortex optical field itself. In the dynamical process, the center-of-mass trajectory of noncanonical vortex condensates with the new type of power exponent phase is always a point, while for the noncanonical vortex condensates with power exponent and oscillating phase, the center-of-mass trajectories are ellipses centering at the origin of coordinates.

ABSTRACT: We trained a neural network based on Resnet to improve the sensing accuracy in measuring the magnetic field applied on a Magneto -optic effect crystal, Bi4Ge3O12(BG0). The sensing system implements the superposition of vortex beams carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) with topological charge of +/- 1. Such composited OAM beams passing through a linear polarizer will produce petal-like pattern, and the pattern captured on charge-coupled device (CCD) sensor will rotate when magnetic field applies on BGO crystals. Detecting the pattern rotation can extract the information of external magnetic field. Considering the noise added on the CCD is rather arbitrary, using transfer learning based on Resnet can significantly improve the precision and accuracy to recognize the angle rotation of different SNR images. This is a potential application in fiber sensing.

ABSTRACT: Optical vortices are attracting much attention because of their applications in various fields of optical processing, communications, enhanced imaging systems, and bio-inspired devices. Different methods to generate optical vortices have been devised to date. Among them, several are based on the exploitation of light-matter interaction in liquid-crystal media. This review focuses on the main mechanisms of vortex generation in liquid crystals, in particular on vortex generation induced by umbilics, that is, defects arising in homeotropically aligned nematic cells, which act as topological matter templates able to realize the conversion from spin to orbital angular momentum of an incoming Gaussian beam. Optical vortex induction in a photosensitive light valve is presented as a self-stabilizing mechanism leading to reconfigurable and programmable vortex arrays. On each lattice site, every matter vortex acts as a photonic spin-to-orbital momentum coupler, converting input arrays of circularly polarized beams into output arrays of vortex beams with topological charges consistent with the matter lattice symmetry.

ABSTRACT: Background: The physics of graphene, the most recently discovered allotrope of carbon, is currently one of the most extensively studied branches of condensed-matter science. Graphene has attracted great attention of the photonics community in the last years. Thanks to its unique optical properties, like broadband absorption, ultrashort recovery time and large modulation depth, it is currently widely used as universal saturable absorber for mode-locking of fiber lasers operating at different wavelengths. Methods: The paper summarizes the most prominent recent achievements in the field of graphene-based mode-locked fiber lasers. The unique optical properties of graphene are also discussed. The recent experimental results reported in the literature are described and compared. Results: The historically first graphene-based fiber lasers were developed in 2009 independently by the groups from Singapore and United Kingdom. Shortly after those reports, a number of papers appeared, demonstrating novel concepts of ultrafast lasers utilizing various forms of graphene, most popularly epitaxially grown and exfoliated (mechanically or in liquid phase). Unique nonlinear optical properties of graphene allowed to achieve many outstanding results and revolutionize the field of ultrafast laser science. Fiber lasers operating at different wavelengths, ranging from 1 to 2 mu m were demonstrated, with pulse durations at the level of femtoseconds. Conclusion: The recent most important advances in the field of ultrafast lasers utilizing graphene have been summarized. Thanks to its unique nonlinear optical properties, graphene has revolutionized the field mode-locked, ultrashort-pulsed fiber lasers. Graphene-based saturable absorbers might be developed in various techniques and they constitute a low-cost and robust alternative to semiconductor-based saturable absorbers. The ongoing research on graphene will surely lead to another, extremely interesting photonics applications of this material in the next years.

ABSTRACT: With the magnetron-sputtering deposition method, a phase indium selenide (alpha-In2Se3) was developed into a saturable absorber (SA) with wideband saturable absorption property at 800, 1560, and 1930 nm. After inserting the alpha-In2Se3 SA into erbium-doped fiber laser (EDFL) and thulium-doped fiber laser (TDFL) systems, we can easily obtain stable soliton pulse trains. The pulse duration/pulse energy/slope efficiency for EDFL and TDFL were 276 fs/2.03 nJ/15.8% and 1.02 ps/7.1 nJ/23.5%, respectively. These results showed that the MSD-grown alpha-In2Se3 could be regarded as high efficiency material to be applied in ultrafast photonics. (c) 2018 Optical Society of America

ABSTRACT: In this paper, we simulate the focusing of a cylindrical vector beam (CVB) of second order, using the Richards-Wolf formula. Many papers have been published on focusing CVB, but they did not report on forming of the toroidal vortices of energy (TVE) near the focus. TVE are fluxes of light energy in longitudinal planes along closed paths around some critical points at which the flux of energy is zero. In the 3D case, such longitudinal energy fluxes form a toroidal surface, and the critical points around which the energy rotates form a circle lying in the transverse plane. TVE are formed in pairs with different directions of rotation (similar to optical vortices with topological charges of different signs). We show that when light with a wavelength of 532 nm is focused by a lens with numerical aperture NA = 0.95, toroidal vortices periodically appear at a distance of about 0.45 mu m (0.85 lambda) from the axis (with a period along the z-axis of 0.8 mu m (1.5 lambda)). The vortices arise in pairs: the vortex nearest to the focal plane is twisted clockwise, and the next vortex is twisted counterclockwise. These vortices are accompanied by saddle points. At higher distances from the z-axis, this pattern of toroidal vortices is repeated, and at a distance of about 0.7 mu m (1.3 lambda), a region in which toroidal vortices are repeated along the z-axis is observed. When the beam is focused and limited by a narrow annular aperture, these toroidal vortices are not observed.

ABSTRACT: As a handicap for passive mode-locked lasers to operate stably for a long time, the undesirable damage threshold of saturable absorption devices means that it is difficult to maintain a normal operation state under the irradiation brought by ultrashort pulses. To reduce the damage probability when the saturable absorption devices interact with an ultrafast laser, some technologies have been developed to resist the high-energy irradiation of an ultrafast laser that will also increase the difficulty of laser construction at the same time. In this paper we put forward a new research idea to improve the low-damage threshold problem: optimizing the optical transmittance, which will avoid dissociation due to excessive heat accumulation. Using the melt and machine exfoliation method, the high optical transmittance (>95%) saturable absorption devices based on Bi2Se3 are prepared, whose damage threshold (2.45 mJ/cm2) is nearly 5 times higher than commercial SESAM. The devices applied to generate femtosecond pulses exhibit exciting nonlinear optical effects, which enable the mode-locked fiber laser to operate with a pulse duration of 195 fs and a signal-to-noise ratio of 81.73 dB. This discovery not only proves that the passive mode-locked laser-based high transmittance Bi2Se3 can obtain reliable pulse output, but also provides a new perspective for the selection of saturable absorption materials in the future.

ABSTRACT: "Reducing device volume is one of the key requirements for advanced nanophotonic technologies  however, this demand is often at odds with designing highly absorbing elements which usually require sizable thicknesses, such as for detector and sensor applications. Here we theoretically explore the thickness limitations of perfectly absorbing resonant systems and show surprisingly low bounds on minimal required thicknesses for total light absorption in thin planar films. We present a framework for understanding, predicting, and engineering topologically protected perfect absorption in a wide range of resonantly absorbing materials. The proposed analytical approach leads to a simple relation between a perfect absorber's thickness and dielectric function loss, which also serves as a guide for determining the absorption potential of existing and emerging materials at the ultimate thickness limit. The presented results offer new insights into the extremes of light-matter interaction and can facilitate the design of ultrasensitive light absorbers for detector and sensor systems."

ABSTRACT: A two-dimensional (2D) In2O3 molecular crystal was successfully prepared by a new chemical reaction assisted vertical macro sublimation method for the first time. It was used as a saturable absorber for the first time to realize a passively Q-switching on Nd/Gd:YAlO3 solid-state laser whose emission wavelength is 1080.2 nm. The shortest pulses width is 598 ns with an average output power of 0.87 W at a repetition rate of 650 kHz, corresponding to a maximum pulse energy of 0.519 mu J. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental proof of the nonlinear absorption characteristics of 2D In2O3 molecular crystal in Nd/Gd:YAlO3 solid-state laser, which also proves that In2O3-SA has great potential for light modulator in similar to 1 mu m spectral region. The results will promote the development of two-dimensional materials and further explore their potential applications in the field of ultra-fast photonics.

ABSTRACT: Shaking a lattice system, by modulating the location of its sites periodically in time, is a powerful method to create effective magnetic fields in engineered quantum systems, such as cold gases trapped in optical lattices. However, such schemes are typically associated with space-dependent effective masses (tunneling amplitudes) and non-uniform flux patterns. In this work we investigate this phenomenon theoretically, by computing the effective Hamiltonians and quasienergy spectra associated with several kinds of lattice-shaking protocols. A detailed comparison with a method based on moving lattices, which are added on top of a main static optical lattice, is provided. This study allows the identification of novel shaking schemes, which simultaneously provide uniform effective mass and magnetic flux, with direct implications for cold-atom experiments and photonics.

ABSTRACT: We theoretically propose and numerically demonstrate a radiative thermal router based on magnetic Weyl semimetals. In designing the thermal router, we utilize two unique properties of optical gyrotropy in magnetic Weyl semimetals: great tunability and nanoscale inhomogeneity. The proposed thermal router consists of three spheres made of magnetic Weyl semimetals, one tunable and two fixed. It can direct a heat flow to a drain of choice by moving the Weyl nodes in the tunable magnetic Weyl semimetal using an external electric, magnetic, or optical field. Such a Weyl-semimetal-based radiative thermal router could enable exciting opportunities in energy harvesting and heat transfer applications.

ABSTRACT: Dissipative couplings between solid-cavity optomechanical oscillators provide an underlying mechanism for many physical phenomena, such as level attraction, non-Hermitian parity-time symmetric, and topological energy transfer with exceptional points (EPs). Until now, cavity optomechanical mode couplings on different phases of material have not been demonstrated. Here, we report the experimental demonstration of optomechanical mode dissipative coupling, mediated by high-quality-factor photon whispering-gallery modes, between a solid surface wave mode (SWM) and a liquid radial breathing mode (RBM), both of which coexist in an optofluidic microbubble resonator consisting of silica layer and liquid metal core. The resonant frequencies of solid-SWM and liquid-RBM depend mainly on the physical parameters of the silica and liquid metal, respectively. These physical parameters are all related to the microcavity temperature, which can be electrically controlled by wiring the liquid metal to a circuit. The dissipative level attraction between the solid-SWM and liquid-RBM is achieved by changing the current applied to the liquid metal. Our results open new avenues toward exploring topological energy transfer between solid and liquid materials or ultrasensitive biological sensing around EPs.

ABSTRACT: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an imaging technique currently used in clinical practice to obtain optical biopsies of different biological tissues in a minimally invasive way. Among the contrast agents proposed to increase the efficacy of this imaging method, gold nanoshells (GNSs) are the best performing ones. However, their preparation is generally time-consuming, and they are intrinsically costly to produce. Herein, we propose a more affordable alternative to these contrast agents: Bi2Se3 nanostructured clusters with a desert rose-like morphology prepared via a microwave-assisted method. The structures are prepared in a matter of minutes, feature strong near-infrared extinction properties, and are biocompatible. They also boast a photon-to-heat conversion efficiency of close to 50%, making them good candidates as photothermal therapy agents. In vitro studies evidence the prowess of Bi2Se3 clusters as OCT contrast agents and prove that their performance is comparable to that of GNSs.

ABSTRACT: We address evolution of a spinor polariton condensate in radially periodic potentials. Such potentials allow for the observation of novel nonlinear excitations and support a variety of dynamically stable soliton states never demonstrated before in polariton condensates, including ring-like solitons with density peaks located in different radial minima of the potential and extended dynamically stable multiring patterns. Among the advantages of the system is that azimuthal modulational instabilities are suppressed due to dominating repulsive interactions between polaritons with the same spin, thereby allowing for the stabilization of radially symmetric states. The representative feature of this system is that spin-orbit coupling between different spinor components requires them to carry different topological charges. Radially symmetric states carrying different combinations of topological charges are discussed. Radially symmetric potentials also support stable rotating multipeaked solitons, whose properties unexpectedly depend not only on the magnitude of the rotation velocity, but also on its sign, that is, on the rotation direction. The latter property is a consequence of spin-orbit coupling, which breaks the equivalence between clockwise and counterclockwise rotations. The multiring structures are shown to be robust against unavoidable losses and are therefore amenable to observations with the presently available experimental techniques.

ABSTRACT: "Weyl fermions have recently been observed in several time-reversal-invariant semimetals and photonics materials with broken inversion symmetry. These systems are expected to have exotic transport properties such as the chiral anomaly. However, most discovered Weyl materials possess a substantial number of Weyl nodes close to the Fermi level that give rise to complicated transport properties. Here we predict, for the first time, a new family of Weyl systems defined by broken time-reversal symmetry, namely, Co-based magnetic Heusler materials XCo(2)Z (X = IVB or VB  Z = IVA or IIIA). To search for Weyl fermions in the centrosymmetric magnetic systems, we recall an easy and practical inversion invariant, which has been calculated to be -1, guaranteeing the existence of an odd number of pairs of Weyl fermions. These materials exhibit, when alloyed, only two Weyl nodes at the Fermi level-the minimum number possible in a condensed matter system. The Weyl nodes are protected by the rotational symmetry along the magnetic axis and separated by a large distance (of order 2 pi) in the Brillouin zone. The corresponding Fermi arcs have been calculated as well. This discovery provides a realistic and promising platform for manipulating and studying the magnetic Weyl physics in experiments."

ABSTRACT: The current rise of quantum technology is compelled by quantum sensing research. Thousands of research labs are developing and testing a broad range of sensor prototypes. However, there is a lack of knowledge about specific applications and real-world use cases where the benefits of these sensors will be most pronounced. This study presents a comprehensive review of quantum sensing state-of-practice. It also provides a detailed analysis of how quantum sensing overcomes the existing limitations of sensor-driven systems' precision and performance. Based on the review of over 500 quantum sensor prototype reports, we determined four groups of quantum sensors and discussed their readiness for commercial usage. We concluded that quantum magnetometry and quantum optics are the most advanced sensing technologies with empirically proven results. In turn, quantum timing and kinetics are still in the early stages of practical validation. In addition, we defined four systems domains in which quantum sensors offer a solution for existing limitations of conventional sensing technologies. These domains are 1) GPS-free positioning and navigating services, 2) time-based operations, 3) topological visibility, and 4) environment detection, prediction, and modeling. Finally, we discussed the current constraints of quantum sensing technologies and offered directions for future research.

ABSTRACT: We achieve controllable noninterferometric rotation of a bored helical beam by introducing a phase shift exclusively to the annular helical region of the phase. We present a derivation based on the decomposition of the beams, which shows that a constant phase shift of Delta Phi between the bore and the surrounding helical phase with topological charge l will rotate the intensity profile by -Delta Phi/l about its center. The effect of the phase shifting is verified with experiments. This technique is simple, while it preserves the transverse intensity profiles of the beams. Our report may find applications in optical manipulation and trapping. (C) 2010 Optical Society of America

ABSTRACT: We model the effects of weak fluctuations on the probability densities and normalized powers of vortex models for the Bessel-Gauss photon beam with fractional topological charge in the paraxial non-Kolmogorov turbulence channel. We find that probability density of signal vortex models is a function of deviation from the center of the photon beam, and the farther away from the beam center it is, the smaller the probability density is. For fractional topological charge, the average probability densities of signal/crosstalk vortex modes oscillate along the beam radius except the half-integer order. As the beam waist of the photon source grows, the average probability density of signal and crosstalk vortex modes grow together. Moreover, the peak of the average probability density of crosstalk vortex modes shifts outward from the beam center as the beam waist gets larger. The results also show that the smaller index of non-Kolmogorov turbulence and the smaller generalized refractive-index structure parameter may lead to the higher average probability densities of signal vortex modes and lower average probability densities of crosstalk vortex modes. Lower-coherence radius or beam waist can give rise to less reduction of the normalized powers of the signal vortex modes, which is opposite to the normalized powers of crosstalk vortex modes.

ABSTRACT: Generalized Multiparticle Mie theory is applied in order to study in detail local-field properties of metallic nanoplanets (i.e., a central cluster surrounded by small satellite clusters very close to its surface), obtained by ion beam techniques. Strongly asymmetric dimers are chosen as model systems in order to establish the influence of topological parameters such as satellite dimension and distance from the central cluster surface on the local-field enhancement, with calculated enhancement factors as high as similar to 180 in the case of silver. Similar topological configurations are shown to be present in typical nanoplanet systems, with comparable local-field enhancement factors. Simulations for silver and silver-gold alloy in silica, and for gold in titania matrix are reported as examples of possible experimental systems. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Artificial magnetic fields for photons can significantly enrich the physics of coupled ring resonator arrays. We push this further to discuss how, under the addition of a harmonic potential, the photonic eigenstates can be recognised as novel Landau levels in momentum space.(1) We present two realistic experimental proposals in which this physics could be realised. Firstly, we discuss how to extend the experiment of Hafezi et al.,(2) where the artificial magnetic field was created using link resonators in a 2D ring resonator array. Secondly, we expand on a proposal in which an effective 2D photonic lattice is realised in a 1D ring resonator chain by exploiting a synthetic dimension for photons.(3) We show that momentum-space Landau levels would have clear signatures in spectroscopic measurements in such experiments, and we discuss the insights gained in this way into geometrical energy bands and particles in magnetic fields.(4)

ABSTRACT: We study the tight focus of generalized (hybrid) Poincare beams. A conventional Poincare beam is a coaxial superposition of two optical vortices, one with left circular polarization and a topological charge (TC) of m, while the other has a right circular polarization and a TC of -m. The generalized Poincare beams are also composed of two optical vortices, but their TCs are different, for instance, p and q. Here, we theoretically investigate the generalized Poincare beams with the TCs p = m + 1 and q = -m in tight focus. In this case, both transverse components of the strength vector of the initial electric field have a topological charge of 1/2, and the beam itself is a cylindrical vector beam of fractional order m + 1/2. Analytical expressions are derived for the components of the strength vectors of the electric and magnetic field at the focus as well as for the intensity distribution, the longitudinal component of the spin angular momentum (SAM), and for the components of the Poynting vector (energy flow density). We show that the intensity at the focus has 2m - 1 local maxima residing evenly in a certain circle radius with the center on the optical axis. We also demonstrate that the radial spin and orbital Hall effects occur at the focus, i.e., the longitudinal SAM component has different signs in the circles of different radii, and the azimuthal component of the transverse Poynting vector also has different signs.

ABSTRACT: We investigated the concept of a ID layered structure for resonant selective thermal emission by excitation Tamm plasmon polaritons (TPPs). The modeled and simulated TPP structures for the mid-IR spectral region yield a promising approach for integrated sensing applications. In particular, the TPP structure is composed of an aperiodic multilayer stack of dielectric layers (silicon and silica) on a planar metallic surface acting as a heater and thus emitter for thermal radiation. By varying the layer depths, this design is highly optimizable for individual specifications, such as for enhancing the thermal emittance near to unity around a target wavelength and achieving a resonance with high Q-factor. Here, for demonstration purposes we chose lambda = 4,26 mu m as the target emission wavelength (corresponding to a major CO2 absorption line). However, considering a larger spectral range within the mid-IR region, parasitic resonances emerge in a more or less unpredictable manner and lead to multiband emission. A transfer matrix approach and genetic algorithm (GA) optimization were used to identify feasible stack configurations and characterize the behavior of parasitic resonances. In order to analyze and control the emergence of parasitic emission, different parameters characterizing the stack-metal composition were set. In particular, we found that keeping constraints on the number of dielectric layers and their individual thicknesses allows effective control of parasitic emission while also facilitating modern microlayer fabrication processes. Even though those constraints can hamper the enhancement of the Q-factor at the target resonance, highly performant configurations and parameters for the TPP structures could be identified. Each configuration corresponds to a particular choice of substrate metals (Ag or W), number of layers, and individual layer thicknesses. The behavior of the target and the parasitic resonances was discussed by using concepts of topological photonics and lumped parameter models. (C) 2018 Optical Society of America

ABSTRACT: A novel, compact, and broadband optical phase contrast microscopy based on incoherent vortex topological quadrupole is theoretically proposed and experimentally realized. The topological quadrupole, generated in a thin uniaxial crystal, possesses four single-charge optical vortexes, each of which can act as a two-dimensional (2D) optical spatial differentiator. The incoherence of light-emitting diode (LED) light will wash out the optical vortex and the spatial differentiation effect, which can be ingeniously overcome by choosing Kohler illumination and inserting a 1 mm-thickness uniaxial crystal sandwiched with two polarizers before the camera. By adjusting the polarizers and the tilted angle of crystal to selectively utilize the geometric Berry phase and the angular gradient of Fresnel transmission coefficients of crystal, the 1D, 2D, and second-order analog spatial differentiations with a spatial resolution better than 0.775 mu m can be switched flexibly. A versatile phase contrast microscope is built, which is well compatible with the conventional microscopes. The uniformly incoherent illumination without laser speckle effects results in high-quality spatial differentiation imaging. Biologically transparent living cells are thus imaged with high contrast.

ABSTRACT: Using Jones matrices and vectors, we show that an optical metasurface composed of a set of subwavelength binary diffraction gratings and characterized by an anisotropic transmittance described by a polarization rotation matrix by the angle m phi, where phi is the polar angle, forms an m- th order azimuthally or radially polarized beam when illuminated by linearly polarized light, generating an optical vortex with the topological charge m upon illumination by circularly polarized light. Such a polarization-phase converter (PPC) performs a spin-orbit transformation, similar to that performed by liquid-crystal q-plates. Using a FDTD method, it is numerically shown that when illuminating the PPC by a uniformly (linearly or circularly) polarized field with topological charge m = 2 and then focusing the output beam with a binary zone plate, a reverse on-axis light flow is formed, being comparable in magnitude with the direct optical flow. Moreover, the reverse flows obtained when focusing the circularly polarized optical vortex with the topological charge m=2 and the second-order polarization vortex are shown to be the same in magnitude.

ABSTRACT: Artificial moire superlattices are formed by vertically stacking two monolayers of two-dimensional (2D) materials and rotating one of the layers with a finite twist angle. The resultant moire pattern in the twisted heterostructures exhibits periodic length scale larger than that of lattice atoms of the individual layers. Furthermore, the moire pattern is found to control the interlayer hybridization in a twisted bilayer heterostructure creating strongly correlated quantum states. Owing to the moire pattern-introduced interlayer hybridization, several exotic quantum phenomena such as flat bands, moire excitons, surface plasmon polaritons, surface phonon polaritons, surface exciton polaritons, interlayer magnetism, and 2D ferroelectricity are recently found in the engineered materials with additional twist degree of freedom. Here we review some notable advances in moire physics associated with twisted bilayer heterostructures of 2D crystals including (A) flat bands in the twisted bilayer graphene, (B) exciton superlattices in the twisted transition metal dichalcogenides, (C) topological polaritons and photonic superlattices in the twisted 2D metal oxides, (D) interlayer magnetism in the stacked 2D magnetic semiconductors, and (E) ferroelectricity in moire quantum materials. This story-of-twist begins with (1) an introduction to twisted heterostructures, (2) a correlation between van der Waals heterostructures and moire superlattices, (3) how to design and fabricate moire quantum materials, (4) discussion on five emergent quantum phenomena associated with twisted bilayer heterostructures as listed above, and finally (5) what are the challenges in fabrication, characterization, and applications of twisted heterostructures. This review concludes with an outlook pointing toward innovation in large-area design of twisted heterostructures for their potential applications in quantum nanoelectronics, quantum photonics, optoelectronics, quantum computing, nonvolatile memory, quantum emission, and quantum communication. Moire physics of moire quantum materials is a relatively new and extremely exciting area of research. This article provides a general overview of recent advances of moire physics in twisted van der Waals heterostructures of 2D materials.

The composition of the two-layer clusters is C46 = 0@(Na2Cd6)@(Na12Cd26) and C50 = 0@(Na3Cd6)@(Na6Cd35). The centers of clusters C46 and C50 are occupied by positions 1a with the symmetry 6/mmm and 2c with the symmetry -6m2.

ABSTRACT: Similar to electromagnetic (EM) phenomena, described by Maxwell equations, physics of magnetoelectric (ME) phenomena deals with the fundamental problems of the relationship between electric and magnetic fields. The different nature of these two notions is especially evident in dynamic regimes. Analyzing the EM phenomena inside the ME material, the question arises: What kind of the near fields, originated from a sample of such a material, can be measured? Observation of the ME states requires an experimental technique characterized by a violation of spatial and temporal inversion symmetries in a subwavelength region. This presumes the existence of specific near fields. Recently, such field structures, called ME fields, were found as the near fields of a quasi-2D subwavelength-size ferrite disk with magnetic-dipolar-mode (MDM) oscillations. The key physical characteristics that determine the configurations of the ME near fields are the spin and orbital angular momenta of the quantum states of the MDM spectra. This leads to the appearance of subwavelength power-flow vortices. By virtue of unique topology, the ME quantum fluctuations in vacuum are different from virtual EM photons. While preserving the ME properties, one observes strong enhancing the near-field intensity. The main purpose of this chapter is to review and analyze the studies of the ME fields. We consider the near-field topological singularities originated from the MDM ferrite-disk particle. These topological features can be transmitted to various types of nonmagnetic material structures.

ABSTRACT: Topologically Protected Meta-Waveguides (TPMW) are recently developed structures supporting topological unidirectional modes. In order to excite and receive these modes efficient coupling between TPMWs and conventional structures, like microstrips, is of primary importance. A cross-shaped slot is here proposed to excite circularly polarized modes along an interface between metallic Photonic Crystals (PhC) that behaves indeed as a TPMW. Reflection coefficient lower than -10 dB is observed in a frequency range of 400MHz for a single port excitation.

ABSTRACT: In this article, we proposed hybrid polarization singularity configurations, based on the superposition of two orthogonal circularly polarized components, one of which is a light beam with two optical vortices. The topological configurations are the hybridization of lowest-order polarization singularities, but are different from high-order polarization singularities. Our numerical simulation may provide a theoretical basis for expanding the variety of polarization singularity configuration.

ABSTRACT:  AND COMPUTATIONAL BIOPHYSICS AND ANALYSIS OF BIOMEDICAL DATA III" Vortex beams are currently used in areas such as optical communication, optical measurement optical micromanipulation and many other applications. There are several prospective ways to generate vortex beams such as: by using special gratings [1,2], spiral phase plates[3], vortex zone plate [4]. Bessel and Gauss-Laguerre beams [5,6] are also considered as Vortex beams. Generation of Bessel beams by vortex axicons were considered in [6]. Possibility of combining the structures and zones topological charge of axicon in the same element was shown. Desired order of Bessel beams can be generated by a large variability of phase diffractive optical elements. In [7] method of forming a simple vortex beams by using a new type of diffractive optical elements, was presented. Diffractive optical element is a lens vortex with a topological charge zones, like the vortex in axicon [8]. In this paper, we have generated vortex beams by the method described in [7], but in addition the lens partitioned into two areas. Each area has different focal length. The proposed element structure can significantly extend focal region with the generated vortex beam that allows rotating microscopic objects in the three-dimensional layer.

ABSTRACT: We analyze the effect of spatial phase modulation using non-linear functions applied to singular warped beams to control their topological states and intensity distribution. Such beams are candidates for optical trapping and particle manipulation for their controllable pattern of intensities and singularities. We first simulate several kinds of warped beams to analyze their intensity profiles and propagation characteristics. Secondly, we experimentally validate the simulations and investigate the far-field profiles. By calculating the intensity gradients, we describe how these beams are qualified candidates for optical manipulation and trapping.

ABSTRACT: In this article, we propose a non-orbital angular momentum (OAM) method for constructing the spiral twists of spin density (SD) vectors in three-dimensional (3D) optical fields. This is realized by generating strings of SD singularities in a longitudinal plane of a strongly focused HG10 mode beam with circular polarization. We demonstrate that in this plane, the SD singularities manifest themselves as the Gouy phase difference. Through observing the Gouy phase difference, the strings of the SD singularities and their topological reactions are examined. It is found that the spiral twists of SD vectors are constructed in the two-dimensional (2D) space between two strings and their twisting behaviors can be adjusted by the topological reactions of the strings. This finding shows that the spiral twists can be formed in a 2D space rather than the 1D space in previous studies, which provides a more flexible way to utilize this rotational degree of freedom. Our result also clarifies that although the spiral twists of SD vectors can be a result of spin-orbital angular momentum interaction, the OAM is not a necessary condition for the generation of these twists. Our theoretical proposal for structuring SD vectors may have applications in 3D optical manipulation.

ABSTRACT: Using the FDTD-aided numerical simulation, we show that uniform linearly or circularly polarized light passing through the described optical metasurface and then tightly focused with a binary zone plate generates an on-axis near-focus energy backflow comparable in magnitude with the incident energy. Notably, the magnitude of the reverse energy flow is shown to be the same when focusing a circularly polarized optical vortex with topological charge m = 2 and a light beam with the second-order polarization singularity.

ABSTRACT: Compact and inexpensive solar concentrators can be designed by using transmission gratings that diffract incident sunlight into a light guide. To this end a grating should have a small period and maintain a high diffraction efficiency over a wide range of incident angles. We numerically study the angular dependence of the diffraction efficiency of surface-relief gratings using Rigorous Coupled-Wave Analysis. It is shown how one can control the angular acceptance of gratings by tuning the refractive index or the grating topology. Gratings with a high refractive index maintain a high diffraction efficiency over a wide range of incident angles. By adjusting the topological symmetry one can design a grating with a high diffraction efficiency over a narrow range of incident angles, or a grating with a more homogenous distribution of the diffraction efficiency.

ABSTRACT: Recently, chiral mass transfer on the surface of plasmonic-active metals appeared upon their ablation with vortex laser pulses was found to be driven by a helical-shape temperature and corresponding surface tension gradients rather than optical angular momentum transfer from the incident beam. Here, we demonstrate that using of perfect optical vortices with different topological charges for direct single-pulse laser ablation of noble-metal films don't allow to change the helicity of produced nanoneedles (also called nanojets). Meanwhile, the chirality of laser-induced nanojets can be tuned in a wide range of parameter by properly designing and tailoring the spiral-shape intensity patterns. Such optimization of the laser intensity profile governing the helical movement of the transiently molten metal allows to produce nanostructures with controlled chirality suited for various nanophotonics and biosensing applications.

ABSTRACT: In this paper, we theoretically investigate the generation of optical vortices by amplitude spiral zone plate made in silver film. Influence of the direction of circularly polarization of incident light on the process of vortices formation is analyzed. An investigation of the amplitude and phase distributions in the focal plane shows the presence of optical vortices with complex topological charge. Analysis of the longitudinal component of the Umov-Poynting vector shows the presence of an inverse energy flow in the focal plane.

ABSTRACT: Propagation-invariant or nondiffracting optical beams have received considerable attention during the last two decades. However, the pulsed nature of light waves and the structured property of optical media like waveguides are often overlooked. We here present a four-dimensional spatiotemporal approach that extends and unifies both concepts of conical waves and helicon beams, mainly studied in bulk media. By taking advantage of tight correlations between the spatial modes, the topological charges, and the frequencies embedded in an optical field, we reveal propagation-invariant (dispersion- and diffraction-free) space-time wavepackets carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) that evolve on spiraling trajectories in both time and space in bulk media or multimode fibers. Besides their intrinsic linear nature, we show that such wave structures can spontaneously emerge when a rather intense ultrashort pulse propagates nonlinearly in OAM modes. With emerging technologies of pulse/beam shaping, multimode fibers, and modal multiplexing, our proposed scheme to create OAM-carrying helicon wavepackets could find a plethora of applications. Finally, our work provides a general approach to explore the dynamics of three-dimensional spiraling wavepackets with topological properties, and the outlook of this topic goes well beyond optics, since such wavepackets are being studied nowadays in various branches of physics such as acoustic spanners, polaritonics, plasma waves, and particle beams.

ABSTRACT: The new physics of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) motivated extensive studies of flat bands hosted by moire superlattices in van der Waals structures, inspiring the investigations into their photonic counterparts with potential applications including Bose-Einstein condensation. However, correlation between photonic flat bands and bilayer photonic moire systems remains unexplored, impeding further development of moire photonics. In this work, we formulate a coupled-mode theory for low-angle twisted bilayer honeycomb photonic crystals as a close analogy of TBG, discovering magic-angle photonic flat bands with a non-Anderson-type localization. Moreover, the interlayer separation constitutes a convenient degree of freedom in tuning photonic moire bands without high pressure. A phase diagram is constructed to correlate the twist angle and separation dependencies to the photonic magic angles. Our findings reveal a salient correspondence between fermionic and bosonic moire systems and pave the avenue toward novel applications through advanced photonic band or state engineering.

ABSTRACT: In this paper, the aperture averaged scintillations of the Bessel beams carrying optical vortices propagating in turbulent atmosphere are evaluated. The multistep form of the propagation algorithm and a numerical phase screen simulation method are applied to the calculations of the aperture averaged scintillation. The results show that the Bessel beam with more topological charges delivers the smaller scintillation. The relation between the aperture averaged scintillation and the size of the beams is investigated. The effect of inner and outer scales of turbulence on the scintillations of the Bessel beams is also studied. These results may be useful in long-distance optical communications in free space or in turbulent atmosphere.

ABSTRACT: "A chemical classification of rare earth (R) trifluorides and some studied RF3-R'F-3 systems with their participation by the difference Delta Z = vertical bar Z(R)-Z(R')vertical bar of atomic numbers R and R' has been developed. The classification has three levels. The first level divides 16 RF3 (without ScF3) in structure and phase transformations into four structural subgroups (SSs): A (LaF3-NdF3)  B (PmF3-GdF3)  C (TbF3 -HoF3), and D (ErF3-LuF3, YF3) with PmF3 belonging to SS B. The second level forms from 10 types of RF3-R'F-3 systems (TSs), in which chemical interactions of the components increase with increasing Delta Z(max). Jumps of Delta Z(max) between some TSs distinguish the third level - four groups of systems (GSs). The jumps in Delta Z(max) are associated with changes in the topological features of the phase diagrams. GS-4 systems are not well understood."

ABSTRACT: We carry out an experimental campaign to investigate the nonlinear self-defocusing propagation of singular light beams with various complex structures of phase and intensity in a colloidal suspension of gold nanoparticles with a plasmonic resonance near the laser wavelength (532nm). Studying optical vortices embedded in Gaussian beams, Bessel vortices and Bessel-cosine (necklace) beams, we gather evidence that while intense vortices turn into two-dimensional dark solitons, all structured wavepackets are able to guide a weak Gaussian probe of different wavelength (632.8 nm) along the dark core. The probe confinement also depends on the topological charge of the singular pump.

ABSTRACT: A perfect vortex beam (PVB) is a propagating optical field carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) with a radial intensity profile that is independent of topological charge. PVBs can be generated through the Fourier transform of a Bessel-Gaussian beam, which typically requires a well-aligned optical setup consisting of a spiral phase plate, an axion, and a lens. Here, based on a single-layer dielectric metasurface, the broadband generation of PVBs across the entire visible spectrum is demonstrated. The metasurface is composed of TiO2 nanopillars acting as deep-subwavelength half-waveplates, and able to provide the desired geometric phase profile to an incident circularly polarized light for the generation of PVBs. Through rigorous optimization of the nanopillars' structural parameters, the authors experimentally generate vortex beams carrying OAM with different topological charges that exhibit constant radial intensity profiles, verifying their perfect characteristics. Furthermore, it is also demonstrated that the ellipticity and diameter of a PVB can be simultaneously controlled by adjusting the structural parameters of the metasurface, which further increases the flexibility in their design. These results open a new route towards creating ultra-compact, flat, multifunctional nanophotonic platforms for efficient generation of structured light beams.

ABSTRACT: Combining defect semiconductors Ga2S3 and Ga2Se3 in Ga2O3-based heterostructured nanowires (NWs) have potential in photonics and optoelectronics applications due to the materials appealing optical properties. In this work, we have developed and studied Ga2O3-Ga2S3 and, for the first time, Ga2O3-Ga2Se3 core-shell NWs. Ga2S3 and Ga2Se3 shell was obtained during high-temperature sulfurization and selenization process of pure Ga2O3 NWs, respectively, in a chemical vapour transport reactor. As-grown nanostructures were characterized with scanning and transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and photoluminescence measurements. Single-nanowire photodetector devices were fabricated in order to demonstrate their electric and photoconductive properties. Such novel core-shell NW heterostructures could potentially be used in next-generation nanoscale electronic and optoelectronic devices.

ABSTRACT: The fabrication of orientationally and positionally ordered colloidal clusters is of interest to several fields from materials science to photonics. An interesting possibility to obtain such colloidal crystalline structures is by the self-assembly of colloidal particles in a liquid crystal matrix. This work demonstrates the self-assembly in a nematic liquid crystal of a specific type of colloidal particle, split ring resonators (SRRs), which are well known in the field of photonic metamaterials and chosen for their ability to obtain resonances in response to a magnetic field. Using free energy minimisation calculations, we specifically optimise geometrical parameters of the SRR particles to reduce and prevent formation of irregular metastable colloidal states, which in more general view corresponds to concepts of pre-designed self-assembly. Using the pre-designed particles, we then show self-assembly into two- and three-dimensional nematic colloidal crystals of split-ring particles. Our work is a contribution to the development of designed large-scale colloidal crystals, the properties of which could be finely tuned with external parameters, and are of high interest for photonic applications, specifically as tunable metamaterials.

ABSTRACT: As a newly-developed two-dimensional (2D) material of group-IVA, few-layer silicon (Si) nanosheets were prepared by the liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) method. Its non-linear saturable adsorption property was investigated by 532 and 1064 nm nanosecond lasers. Using Si nanosheets as the saturable absorber (SA), passive Q-switched all-solid-state lasers were demonstrated for the first time. For different laser emissions of Nd3+ at 0.9, 1.06, and 1.34 mu m, the narrowest Q-switched pulse widths were 200.2, 103.7, and 110.4 ns, corresponding to the highest peak powers of 2.76, 2.15, and 1.26 W. The results provide a promising SA for solid-state pulsed lasers and broaden the potential application range of Si nanosheets in ultrafast photonics and optoelectronics.

ABSTRACT: Reconfigurable photonic mesh networks of tunable beamsplitter nodes can linearly transform N-dimensional vectors representing input modal amplitudes of light for applications such as energy-efficient machine learning hardware, quantum information processing, and mode demultiplexing. Such photonic meshes are typically programmed and/or calibrated by tuning or characterizing each beam splitter one-by-one, which can be time-consuming and can limit scaling to larger meshes. Here we introduce a graph-topological approach that defines the general class of feedforward networks and identifies columns of non-interacting nodes that can be adjusted simultaneously. By virtue of this approach, we can calculate the necessary input vectors to program entire columns of nodes in parallel by simultaneously nullifying the power in one output of each node via optoelectronic feedback onto adjustable phase shifters or couplers. This parallel nullification approach is robust to fabrication errors, requiring no prior knowledge or calibration of node parameters and reducing programming time by a factor of order N to being proportional to the optical depth (number of node columns). As a demonstration, we simulate our programming protocol on a feedforward optical neural network model trained to classify handwritten digit images from the MNIST dataset with up to 98% validation accuracy.

ABSTRACT: Transformation optics enables engineering of the effective topology and dimensionality of the optical space in metamaterials. Nonlinear optics of such metamaterials may mimic Kaluza-Klein theories having one or more kinds of effective charges. As a result, novel photon blockade devices may be realized. Here we demonstrate that an electromagnetic wormhole may be designed, which connects two points of such an optical space and changes its effective topological connectivity. Electromagnetic field configurations, which exhibit fractional effective charges, appear as a result of such topology change. Moreover, such effects as Misner-Wheeler charge without charge may be replicated.

ABSTRACT: The Winter Colloquium on the Physics of Quantum Electronics (PQE) has been a seminal force in quantum optics and related areas since 1971. It is rather mind-boggling to recognize how the concepts presented at these conferences have transformed scientific understanding and human society. In January 2017, the participants of PQE were asked to consider the equally important prospects for the future, and to formulate a set of questions representing some of the greatest aspirations in this broad field. The result is this multi-authored paper, in which many of the world's leading experts address the following fundamental questions: (1) What is the future of gravitational wave astronomy? (2) Are there new quantum phases of matter away from equilibrium that can be found and exploited - such as the time crystal? (3) Quantum theory in uncharted territory: What can we learn? (4) What are the ultimate limits for laser photon energies? (5) What are the ultimate limits to temporal, spatial and optical resolution? (6) What novel roles will atoms play in technology? (7) What applications lie ahead for nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond? (8) What is the future of quantum coherence, squeezing and entanglement for enhanced super-resolution and sensing? (9) How can we solve (some of) humanity's biggest problems through new quantum technologies? (10) What new understanding of materials and biological molecules will result from their dynamical characterization with free-electron lasers? (11) What new technologies and fundamental discoveries might quantum optics achieve by the end of this century? (12) What novel topological structures can be created and employed in quantum optics?

ABSTRACT: Black phosphorus (BP), an emerging narrow direct band-gap two-dimensional (2D) layered material that can fill the gap between the semi-metallic graphene and the wide-bandgap transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), had been experimentally found to exhibit the saturation of optical absorption if under strong light illumination. By taking advantage of this saturable absorption property, we could fabricate a new type of optical saturable absorber (SA) based on mechanically exfoliated BPs, and further demonstrate the applications for ultra-fast laser photonics. Based on the balanced synchronous twin-detector measurement method, we have characterized the saturable absorption property of the fabricated BPSAs at the telecommunication band. By incorporating the BP-based SAs device into the all-fiber Erbium-doped fiber laser cavities, we are able to obtain either the passive Q-switching (with maximum pulse energy of 94.3 nJ) or the passive mode-locking operation (with pulse duration down to 946 fs). Our results show that BP could also be developed as an effective SA for pulsed fiber or solid-state lasers. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America

ABSTRACT: Layered 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) exhibited fascinating nonlinear optical (NLO) properties for constructing varied promising optoelectronics. However, exploring the desired 2D materials with both superior nonlinear absorption and ultrafast response in broadband spectra remain the key challenges to harvest their greatest potential. Here, based on synthesizing 2D PdSe2 films with the controlled layer number, the authors systematically demonstrated the broadband giant NLO performance and ultrafast excited carrier dynamics of this emerging material under femtosecond visible-to-near-infrared laser-pulse excitation (400-1550 nm). Layer-dependent and wavelength-dependent evolution of optical bandgap, nonlinear absorption, and photocarrier dynamics in the obtained 2D PdSe2 are clearly revealed. Specially, the transition from semiconducting to semimetallic PdSe2 induced dramatic changes of their interband absorption-relaxation process. This work makes 2D PdSe2 more competitive for future ultrafast photonics and also opens up a new avenue for the optical performance optimization of various 2D materials by rational design of these materials.

ABSTRACT: U We have shown that when sharply focusing a linearly polarized optical vortex with topological charge 2, in the near-axis region of the focal plane, not only does a reverse energy flow (the negative on-axis projection of the Poynting vector) occur, but also the right-handed circular polarization of light. Moreover, due to spin-orbital angular momentum conversion, the on-axis polarization vector and the transverse energy flow rotate around the optical axis in the same direction (counterclockwise). If an absorbing spherical microparticle is put in the focus on the optical axis, it will rotate around the axis and around its center of mass counterclockwise. Numerical simulation results confirms the theoretical predictions.

ABSTRACT: It is theoretically and numerically demonstrated that a mixture of two topologically distinct material phases is characterized by an anomalous transparency window in a spectral range wherein the individual material phases are strongly reflecting. In particular, it is shown that a metamaterial formed by a metallic wire grid embedded in a magnetized plasma may support the propagation of waves with long wavelengths, notwithstanding the components, when taken separately, completely block the electromagnetic radiation. The effect is explained in terms of topological properties of the magnetoplasmon. Furthermore, it is highlighted that some naturally available materials may be regarded as a mixture of two topologically distinct phases, and hence may be characterized by a similar anomalous transparency effect as well.

ABSTRACT: The work is devoted to the investigation of the process of reflection of laser beams from rough surfaces with different degrees of roughness. Based on the results of numerical experiments the applicability of the method of correlation analysis of speckle-structures for non-destructive inspection of surfaces with different parameters of roughness was evaluated. The optimal ratios between the parameters of the rough surfaces and parameters of the optical system, which provide the best efficiency of the method, were determined. It was established that in case of the increase of the number of topological charges the sensitivity of the optical system to changes of parameters of surface roughness increases.

ABSTRACT: "By utilizing the holographic technique, a novel type of twins composite discrete Airy-vortex accelerating beam is generated with discrete Airy-vortex phase which is processed by binary phase. The propagation properties of the accelerating beam and the modulation of different parameters [the linear factor(s),the number of total layer (N) and the topological gradient (Delta L)] to the accelerating beam is also studied by theoretical simulation and experiment. The results show that such twins accelerating beam will split itself into several separated Airy-like beams due to the discrete and rotatory effect in propagation  and the separated Airy-like beams evolve into one-dimensional Airy-like beams by adjusting the propagation distance and Delta L. Furthermore, s and N can modulate the intensity distribution of twins accelerating beam and the space distribution of twins accelerating beam in initial plane (the plane x-y at z = 0), respectively  Delta L also can modulate the intensity distribution of separated Airy-like beams."

ABSTRACT: We introduce a simple scheme to implement synthetic dimensions in ultracold atomic gases, which only requires two basic and ubiquitous ingredients: the harmonic trap, which confines the atoms, combined with a periodic shaking. In our approach, standard harmonic oscillator eigenstates are reinterpreted as lattice sites along a synthetic dimension, while the coupling between these lattice sites is controlled by the applied time modulation. The phase of this modulation enters as a complex hopping phase, leading straightforwardly to an artificial magnetic field upon adding a second dimension. We show that this artificial gauge field has important consequences, such as the counterintuitive reduction of average energy under resonant driving, or the realization of quantum Hall physics. Our approach offers significant advantages over previous implementations of synthetic dimensions, providing an intriguing route towards higher-dimensional topological physics and strongly-correlated states.

ABSTRACT: In this article, we developed a generalized coupled-mode theory for mixing an isolated state with a continuum having an intrinsic energy gap, which dubbed as the bound states in the gapped continuum (BIGC). We investigated the mixture interaction by mimicking the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model in an optical coupled waveguide array (WA), and presented a unified engineering mechanism for topologically-protected zero modes, Fano resonance, and Tamm surface states, even though those phenomena are diverse in topological insulators, atomic physics and semiconductors, respectively. By tuning the on-site potential and coupling strength of the isolated state, we found the unified operating characteristics for zero modes, Fano resonance, and Tamm states, with demonstrating their localization, transmission spectra, and distinct evolution dynamics explicitly. As an extension for triple-modes coupling, two special sandwich-like configurations are studied: the isolated-continuous-isolated and continuous-isolated-continuous configurations lead to adiabatic eliminations and domain walls, respectively, revealing possible applications and wide connections in many fields of physics and optics.

ABSTRACT: Rapid progresses have been achieved in the photonic applications of two-dimensional materials such as graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides, and topological insulators. The strong light-matter interactions and large optical nonlinearities in these atomically thin layered materials make them promising saturable absorbers for pulsed laser applications. Either Q-switching or mode-locking pulses with particular output characteristics can be achieved by using different saturable absorbers. However, it remains still very challenging to produce saturable absorbers with tunable optical properties, in particular, carrier dynamics, saturation intensity as well as modulation depth, to suit for self-starting, high energy or ultrafast pulse laser generation. Here we report a new type of saturable absorber which is a van der Waals heterostructure consisting of graphene and Bi2Te3. The synergetic integration of these two materials by epitaxial growth affords tunable optical properties, that is, both the photocarrier dynamics and the nonlinear optical modulation are variable by tuning the coverage of Bi2Te3 on graphene. We further fabricated graphene Bi2Te3 saturable absorbers and incorporated them into a 1.5 pm fiber laser to demonstrate both Q-switching and mode-locking pulse generation. This work provides a new insight for tailoring two-dimensional heterostructures so as to develop desired photonic applications.

ABSTRACT: We reveal unconventional edge states in a one-dimensional Stub lattice of coupled waveguides with staggered hoppings. The edge states appear for the same values of hoppings as topological edge states in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. They have different energies depending on the lattice termination and present a remarkable robustness against certain types of disorder. We evidence experimentally the phase transition at which these edge states appear, opening the door to the engineering of one-dimensional lattices with localized edge modes whose energy and location can be controlled at will.

ABSTRACT: Tight focusing of ultrashort near infrared laser pulses in the bulk of various transparent materials induces significant modifications of the optical properties by locally changing the material refractive index. Such laser-induced phase objects are of major technological interest, notably for direct writing of embedded optical functions. While extensive studies have been reported on ultrashort pulsed laser-induced modifications in several materials.. especially with regard to focusing conditions, incubation effects, or the influence of the energy content of the pulse, we emphasize here the role of the temporal design of the excitation sequence. We present phase-contrast microscopy investigations of the resultant morphology and discuss the refractive index topological map induced by different temporal Pulse intensity envelopes in various transparent materials. The consequences of temporal profiles generated by a pulse shaping apparatus on the morphology of the interaction zone are illustrated, emphasizing the benefits of the synchronization between the excitation temporal profile and the material response.

ABSTRACT: This paper is an overview of available data on crystal structures, crystal chemical features, physical and chemical properties, and genesis of multilayer microporous compounds related to cancrinite and sodalite (CRCs). These compounds meet the criteria for considering them as zeolite-type materials and molecular sieves. Ten types of the CRCs' frameworks (AFG, CAN, FAR, FRA, GIU, LIO, LOS, MAR, TOL, SOD) have been included into the Database of Zeolite Structures. Since the overwhelming majority of such materials are known only as phases of natural origin, a significant part of the review refers to multilayer mineral species belonging to the cancrinite group. Separate sections of the review contain data on various topological types of aluminosilicate frameworks, crystal chemistry of extra-framework components, isomorphism, IR spectroscopy, and genesis of multilayer CRCs as well as physical and chemical properties of two- and three-layer representatives of this group of microporous materials (i.e. materials with cancrinite- and sodalite-type frameworks, respectively).

ABSTRACT: With the proposal of dual-wavelength pumping (DWP) scheme, DWP Er:ZBLAN fiber lasers at 3.5 mu m have become a fascinating area of research. However, limited by the absence of suitable saturable absorber, passively Q-switched and mode-locked fiber lasers have not been realized in this spectral region. Based on the layer-dependent bandgap and excellent photoelectric characteristics of black phosphorus (BP), BP is a promising candidate for saturable absorber near 3.5 mu m. Here, we fabricated a 3.5-mu m saturable absorber mirror (SAM) by transferring BP flakes onto a Au-coated mirror. With the as-prepared BP SAM, we realized Q-switching and mode-locking operations in the DWP Er:ZBLAN fiber lasers at 3.5 mu m. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to achieve passively Q- switched and mode-locked pulses in 3.5 mu m spectral region. The research results will not only promote the development of 3.5-mu m pulsed fiber lasers but also open the photonics application of twodimensional materials in this spectral region.

ABSTRACT: Surfaces plasmon polaritons carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM), known as plasmonic vortex, hold potential applications for on-chip information multiplexing. However, a traditional plasmonic vortex lens was usually designed for monochromatic incident light and encountered challenges in generating multiple vortices. Here, we demonstrated a wavelength-tunable plasmonic vortex generator that ameliorates these limits, relying on the simultaneous design of a geometric metasurface on an Archimedean spiral. Through this design strategy, both the topological charges and the location of vortices can be controlled with different wavelengths of incident beams. This design and concept can preserve incident wavelength information and can be further applied to integrated and high-dimensional on-chip devices.

ABSTRACT: "Designing new experiments in physics is a challenge for humans  therefore, computers have become a tool to expand scientists' capabilities and to provide creative solutions. This Perspective article examines computer-inspired designs in quantum physics that led to laboratory experiments and inspired new scientific insights. The design of new devices and experiments has historically relied on the intuition of human experts. Now, design inspirations from computers are increasingly augmenting the capability of scientists. We briefly overview different fields of physics that rely on computer-inspired designs using a variety of computational approaches based on topological optimization, evolutionary strategies, deep learning, reinforcement learning or automated reasoning. Then we focus specifically on quantum physics. When designing new quantum experiments, there are two challenges: quantum phenomena are unintuitive, and the number of possible configurations of quantum experiments explodes exponentially. These challenges can be overcome by using computer-designed quantum experiments. We focus on the most mature and practical approaches to find new complex quantum experiments, which have subsequently been realized in the lab. These methods rely on a highly efficient topological search, which can inspire new scientific ideas. We review several extensions and alternatives based on various optimization and machine learning techniques. Finally, we discuss what can be learned from the different approaches and outline several future directions."

ABSTRACT: The dynamics of the topological charge of a vortex optical beam propagating in turbulent air while accounting for the cubic nonlinearity is theoretically considered. In a number of examples, we show that the optical beam, self-focusing, manifests itself ambiguously depending on the optical wave power. At near-critical values of beam power, self-focusing leads to enhanced spatial localization of optical vortices and substantial suppression of vortex walk-off relative to the beam axis caused by air turbulence. However, with increasing optical intensity, the modulation instability imposed by cubic nonlinearity becomes significant and contributes jointly with medium turbulence and leads to faster divergence of vortex beams.

ABSTRACT: We demonstrated that a ring-core erbium-doped fiber amplifier (RC-EDFA) can support orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes with topological charges (vertical bar l vertical bar = 1 similar to 3). The dependence of the characteristics on the length of the RC-EDF was investigated experimentally, including an investigation of gain and 3 dB gain bandwidth over the whole C band (i.e., 1530-1565 nm). The 3 dB gain bandwidth was improved to 21 nm. At a signal wavelength of 1550 nm, the maximum gain of all signal modes was up to 30.1 dB. Differential modal gain was maintained below approximately 1.3 dB.

ABSTRACT: Gray arsenic (beta-phase) has aroused great attention in photonics and electronics applications, as a novel family member of two-dimensional (2D) elemental crystals of group-VA. Here, beta-phase arsenic (beta-As) bulk crystals were synthesized via the chemical vapor transport (CVT) method. Meanwhile, large-scale beta-As nanoflake was transformed using the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-assisted dry transfer method and was placed on the end cap of optical fiber with high coverage over the core area. Moreover, the beta-As was used as a saturable absorber in ytterbium-doped fiber ring cavity resonance, and we demonstrated near-infrared ultrafast pulse fiber laser with the central wavelength, repetition rate, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 1,037.3 nm, 0.6 MHz, and 67.7 dB, respectively. This research demonstrates a 2D material small area deterministic transfer method and promotes the potential application of group-VA crystals in near-infrared ultrafast laser generation.

ABSTRACT: The conductivity in the monoclinic polymorphs of Ln(2)MoO(6) (Ln = Sm, Gd, Dy) oxymolybdates was investigated by theoretical and experimental methods. A theoretical approach consisted of geometrical-topological analysis, bond valence site energy, kinetic Monte-Carlo (KMC) modeling and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The theoretical results have shown that oxygen ionic conductivity is possible in all oxymolybdates with DFT migration energy <1.39 eV. We also calculated oxygen ionic conductivity at various temperatures (500-800 degrees C) using KMC modeling and found values higher than 10(-3.5) S/cm at 800 degrees C, which was in agreement with the experimental measurements. The total conductivity achieved similar to 10(-5) S/cm for Sm2MoO6, similar to 10(-4) S/cm for Gd2MoO6 and similar to 10(-3) S/cm for Dy2MoO6 at 800 degrees C according to impedance spectroscopy data. The oxygen pressure isotherms in the Ln(2)MoO(6) (Ln = Sm, Gd, Dy) indicated electronic conductivity contribution in the temperature range of 500-800 degrees C. The experimental electromotive force (EMF) method also showed an increase in the contribution of electronic conductivity with the temperature growth. The activation energy of oxygen ionic diffusion according to EMF data was in the range of 0.78-1.27 eV.

ABSTRACT: Since the emergence of graphene, we have seen several proposals for the realization of Landau lasers tunable over the terahertz frequency range. The hope was that the non-equidistance of the Landau levels from Dirac fermions would suppress the harmful non-radiative Auger recombination. Unfortunately, even with this non-equidistance, an unfavourable non-radiative process persists in Landau-quantized graphene, and so far no cyclotron emission from Dirac fermions has been reported. One way to eliminate this last non-radiative process is to sufficiently modify the dispersion of the Landau levels by opening a small gap in the linear band structure. HgTe quantum wells close to the topological phase transition are a proven example of such gapped graphene-like materials. In this work we experimentally demonstrate Landau emission from Dirac fermions in such HgTe quantum wells, where the emission is tunable by both the magnetic field and the carrier concentration. Consequently, these results represent an advance in the realization of terahertz Landau lasers tunable by a magnetic field and gate voltage.

ABSTRACT: Plasmons supported in the massless electron surface states of topological insulators (TIs), known as Dirac plasmons, have great potential in next generation optoelectronics. However, their inherent confinement to the surface makes the investigation of Dirac plasmons challenging. Near-field techniques provide the ideal platform to directly probe Dirac plasmons due to the sensitivity to evanescent fields at the surface. Here, we demonstrate the use of aperture near-field spectroscopy for the investigation of localized terahertz (THz) Dirac plasmon resonances in Bi2Se3 ribbon arrays with widths ranging from 10 to 40 mu m. Unlike scattering THz near-field techniques, the aperture method is most sensitive to plasmons with the relevant lower-momenta corresponding to plasmon wavelengths on the scale of similar to 20 mu m. The combination of THz time-domain spectroscopy and aperture near-field microscopy enables sampling of localized Dirac plasmons in the near-field zone in the 0.5-2.5 THz range. We map the plasmon dispersion, which reveals a coupled plasmon-phonon polariton interaction. The near-field spectra show a higher contrast of the upper polariton branch in comparison with far-field observations. The information revealed by aperture near-field spectroscopy could deepen our understanding of the behavior of Dirac plasmons, leading to the potential development of real-world TI devices.

ABSTRACT: The evolution of a vector vortex optical field (VVOF) with a spiral phase and azimuthally-variant polarization distributions in the field cross-section in a strongly nonlocal nonlinear (SNN) medium is demonstrated. The dynamics of interplay between the singular points of polarization and vortex during propagation in the SNN medium leads to novel phenomena. When the topological charge number of the polarization is equal to that of the vortex, the singular point in the beam center is annihilated and the energy can accumulate in the beam center due to the self-focus effect. Furthermore, the linear-circular polarization conversion occurs and can be controllable in the beam center or the periphery of VVOF depending on the different topological charge numbers of the vortex and polarization, due to the coherent superposition of the different polarization components during propagation in an SNN medium. The VVOF rotates along the propagation axis in an SNN medium because of the existence of the vortex, and the optical field as well as the distribution of polarization in the field cross-section always evolves reciprocally with cycles of stretch and shrink in an SNN medium. The numerical results confirm the analytical predictions by the moment method for the vector dynamics of the VVOF during propagation in an SNN medium. The underlying physics for the linear circular polarization conversion in a VVOF during propagation in an SNN medium are discussed in detail.

ABSTRACT: Three-dimensional (3D) light fields with spatially inhomogeneous polarization and intensity distributions play an increasingly important role in photonics due to their peculiar optical features and extra degrees of freedom for carrying information. However, it is very challenging to simultaneously control the intensity profile and polarization profile in an arbitrary manner. Here we experimentally demonstrate a metalens that can focus light into an arbitrarily shaped focal curve with a predefined polarization distribution. The efficacy of this approach is exemplified through the demonstration of focused curves in 3D space ranging from simple shapes such as a circle to topologically nontrivial objects such as a 3D knot with controlled local polarization states. This powerful control of the light field would be technically challenging with their conventional counterparts. Our demonstration may find applications in beam engineering and integration optics.

To design the optimal simulation methodology leads to obtain the accurate data for practical design of photosensitive pixels. After a series of simulations the algorithm for charge capacity CCD elements calculation through the two-dimensional physic-topological modeling had been developed. This algorithm gives the set of optimal driving voltages for CCD element too. This algorithm had been widely used in practical design of photosensitive CCD and demonstrates the good calculation time economy.

ABSTRACT: Positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy is used to study the structural changes in amorphous arsenic sulfides of a binary As-S system induced by high-energy -radiation of Co-60 source. It is demonstrated that radiation-induced effects in positron trapping modes of the studied glasses are in strict correlation with shift of their fundamental optical absorption edge. The -induced physical aging is shown to be dominated in the rejuvenated S-rich glasses, thermally induced physical aging accompanies annealing of the rejuvenated g-AsxS100-x, while coordination topological defects are character for near-stoichiometric glasses (both annealed and rejuvenated). The competitive processes of free-volume void evolutions such as agglomeration-fragmentation, expansion-contraction, and charging-discharging are considered as possible stages of radiation- and thermally induced structural transformations. The meaningful model for -irradiation and relaxation-driven evolution in the void structure of As-S glasses is proposed. The free-volume evolution in g-AsxS100-x associated with thermally and -induced physical aging is shown to be consistent with a void fragmentation process, while the formation of -induced coordination topological defects leads mainly to void charging.

ABSTRACT: Based on the extended Huygens-Fresnel principle, the analytical equation for a Lorentz-Gauss vortex beam propagating through oceanic turbulence has been derived. The spreading properties of a Lorentz-Gauss vortex beam propagating through oceanic turbulence are analyzed in detail using numerical examples. The results show that a Lorentz-Gauss vortex beam propagating through stronger oceanic turbulence will spread more rapidly, and the Lorentz-Gauss vortex beam with higher topological charge M will lose its initial dark center more slowly.

ABSTRACT: We experimentally demonstrate a technique for the generation of optical beams carrying orbital angular momentum using a planar semiconductor microcavity. Despite being isotropic systems with no structural gyrotropy, semiconductor microcavities, because of the transverse-electric-transverse-magnetic polarization splitting that they feature, allow for the conversion of the circular polarization of an incoming laser beam into the orbital angular momentum of the transmitted light field. The process implies the formation of topological entities, a pair of optical vortices, in the intracavity field.

ABSTRACT: Due to their broadband nonlinear optical properties, low-dimensional materials are widely used for pulse generation in fiber and solid-state lasers. Here we demonstrate novel materials, Bi2Te2Se (BTS) and Sn-doped Bi2Te2Se (BSTS), which can be used as a universal saturable absorbers for distinct spectral regimes. The material was mechanically exfoliated from a bulk single-crystal and deposited onto a side-polished fiber. We have performed characterization of the fabricated devices and employed them in polarization-maintaining ytterbium-and erbium-doped fiber lasers. This enabled us to obtain self-starting passively Q-switched regime at 1 mu m and 1.56 mu m. The oscillators emitted stable, linearly polarized radiation with the highest single pulse energy approaching 692 nJ. Both lasers are characterized by the best performance observed in all-polarization maintaining Q-switched fiber lasers with recently investigated new saturable absorbers, which was enabled by a very high damage threshold of the devices. This demonstrates the great potential of the investigated materials for the ultrafast photonics community.

ABSTRACT: We have investigated the impact of the processing methodology on nanocomposite thin films formed via blade casting versus spin coating on the electric breakdown strength and energy storage properties of BaTiO3 nanoparticle/poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) nanocomposites. Nanocomposite films containing 50% volume loading of surface-modified BaTiO3 nanoparticles fabricated by the use of blade casting showed a denser and more uniform morphology, and larger polymer crystallite domains, relative to those obtained via spin coating. The improved morphology has resulted in an increase of up to 60% in the breakdown strength and in energy density by a factor of similar to 2-3 and for blade-cast vs. spin coated nanocomposite films containing 50 or 120 nm BaTiO3 nanoparticles, yielding a maximum extractable energy density of 7 J cm(-3). We attribute the increase in energy density and dielectric breakdown strength to the effects of the improved uniformity and the formation of polymer nanocrystalline domains in the matrix, as shown by cross-sectional SEM and topological AFM images, and X-ray diffraction results. These results stress the importance of controlling nanoscale morphology for optimizing energy storage capacity of solution-processed nanocomposite thin films for pulsed power, gate dielectrics, and other thin-film power applications.

ABSTRACT: Here we study asymmetric Kummer beams (aK-beams) with their scalar complex amplitude being proportional to the Kummer function (a degenerate hypergeometric function). These beams are an exact solution of the paraxial propagation equation (Schrodinger-type equation) and obtained from the conventional symmetric hypergeometric beams by a complex shift of the transverse coordinates. On propagation, the aK-beams change their intensity weakly and rotate around the optical axis. These beams are an example of vortex laser beams with a fractional orbital angular momentum (OAM), which depends on four parameters: the vortex topological charge, the shift magnitude, the logarithmic axicon parameter and the degree of the radial factor. Changing these parameters, it is possible to control the beam OAM, either continuously increasing or decreasing it.

ABSTRACT: Surface plasmon polaritons carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM), namely, as plasmonic vortices, have attracted considerable attention in optical trapping, quantum information processing, and communications. The previous studies of near-field OAM are limited to generate only one single plasmonic vortex, which inevitably degrades further on-chip applications. Geometric metasurfaces, two-dimensional counterpart of metamaterials, enable the unprecedented capability in manipulating the phase, polarization, and amplitude of electromagnetic waves, providing a flexible platform in controlling plasmonic vortices. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate an approach to realize the multiplexing of terahertz (THz) plasmonic vortices based on geometric metasurfaces. Under the illumination of circularly polarized THz waves, multiple plasmonic vortices with identical topological charges are generated at the metal/air interface. Furthermore, the conversion from spin angular momentum to multiple plasmonic OAM, i.e., multiple plasmonic vortices with different topological charges, is also demonstrated. Geometric metasurfaces consisting of paired air-slits with different in-plane orientations are designed to demonstrate these characteristics. Our proposed approach may open an avenue for on-chip applications with increasing information capacity.

ABSTRACT:  AND SPECTROSCOPY AND MOLECULAR MODELING" Nonlinear dynamics of a trapped Bose-Einstein condensate, subject to the action of a resonant external field, is studied, This field produces a spatio-temporal modulation of the trapping potential with the frequency close to the transition frequency between the ground state and a higher energy level. The evolution equations of fractional populations display a kind of critical phenomena at a critical line on the manifold of the system parameters. It is demonstrated that there exists a direct analogy between dynamical instability at this line and critical phenomena at a critical line of a related averaged system.

ABSTRACT: In this work, we study three different types of astigmatic (anisotropic) Hermite-Gaussian (aHG) beams whose complex amplitude in the Fresnel diffraction zone is described by the complex argument of a Hermite polynomial of degree (n, 0). The first-type beam is a circularly symmetric optical vortex with topological charge n that has passed through a cylindrical lens. The outgoing optical vortex 'splits' into n first-order optical vortices, carrying an orbital angular momentum (OAM) per photon of n. The second-type beam is a Hermite-Gaussian (HG) beam of order (n, 0) generated by passing an elliptic HG beam through a cylindrical lens, which acts by imprinting an OAM into the original HG beam. The OAM of such a beam is a sum of vortex and astigmatic components and can reach large values (tens and hundreds of thousands per photon). We derive an exact formula to describe the OAM of these aHG beams. Under certain conditions, the zero intensity lines of the aHG beam 'merge' into an n-fold degenerate intensity null on the optical axis, with the OAM of the beam becoming equal to n. The third type is an elliptical optical vortex with topological charge n that has passed through a cylindrical lens. With a special choice of the ellipticity degree (1:3), the beam retains its structure upon propagation, with the on-axis degenerate intensity null not 'splitting' into n optical vortices. The beam is shown to carry a fractional OAM not equal to n. Using intensity distributions of the aHG beam in the foci of two cylindrical lenses, we measure a normalized OAM of the elliptic aHG beam, with the deviation from a theoretical estimate being as low as 7% (experimental OAM-13.62 and theoretical OAM-14.76).

ABSTRACT: Pseudospin is an angular momentum degree of freedom introduced in analogy to the real electron spin in the effective massless Dirac-like equation used to describe wave evolution at conical intersections such as the Dirac cones of graphene. Here, we study a photonic implementation of a chiral borophene allotrope hosting a pseudospin-2 conical intersection in its energy-momentum spectrum. The presence of this fivefold spectral degeneracy gives rise to quasiparticles with pseudospin up to +/- 2. We report on conical diffraction and pseudospin-orbit interaction of light in photonic chiral borophene, which, as a result of topological charge conversion, leads to the generation of highly charged optical phase vortices.

ABSTRACT: Axis-symmetric grooves milled in metallic slabs have been demonstrated to promote the transfer of Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) from far- to near-field and vice versa, thanks to spin-orbit coupling effects involving Surface Plasmons (SP). However, the high absorption losses and the polarization constraints, which are intrinsic in plasmonic structures, limit their effectiveness for applications in the visible spectrum, particularly if emitters located in close proximity to the metallic surface are concerned. Here, an alternative mechanism for vortex beam generation is presented, wherein a free-space radiation possessing OAM is obtained by diffraction of Bloch Surface Waves (BSWs) on a dielectric multilayer. A circularly polarized laser beam is tightly focused on the multilayer surface by means of an immersion optics, such that TE-polarized BSWs are launched radially from the focused spot. While propagating on the multilayer surface, BSWs exhibit a spiral-like wavefront due to the Spin-Orbit Interaction (SOI). A spiral grating surrounding the illumination area provides for the BSW diffraction out-of-plane and imparts an additional azimuthal geometric phase distribution defined by the topological charge of the spiral structure. At infinity, the constructive interference results into free-space beams with defined combinations of polarization and OAM satisfying the conservation of the Total Angular Momentum, based on the incident polarization handedness and the spiral grating topological charge. As an extension of this concept, chiral diffractive structures for BSWs can be used in combination with surface cavities hosting light sources therein.

ABSTRACT: The electronic structure and optical transitions of HgTe nanoplatelets (NPLs) are calculated by means of an 8-band kp Hamiltonian. We show that, for NPL thickness between the limits of strong confinement (similar to 1 nm) and that of band gap collapse (similar to 6 nm), the photophysics is largely governed by the Gamma(6) - Gamma(8) band coupling. This leads to a nontrivial size dependence of the energy spectrum and charge distribution. A prominent effect is the formation of hybrid states in the conduction band, which evolve gradually from volume to surface localization as the thickness increases. This property enables controlled switching from direct to indirect exciton behavior without the need of using type-II heterostructures, which suppresses interband recombination. By contrast, intraband transition rates are enhanced. The small band gap of thick HgTe NPLs, together with the large binding energy of excitons, suggests that the excitonic insulator phase may be within reach.

ABSTRACT: Here we study three different types of astigmatic Gaussian beams, whose complex amplitude in the Fresnel diffraction zone is described by the complex argument Hermite polynomial of the order (n, 0). The first type is a circularly symmetric Gaussian optical vortex with and a topological charge n after passing through a cylindrical lens. On propagation, the optical vortex  splits into n first-order optical vortices. Its orbital angular momentum per photon is equal to n. The second type is an elliptical Gaussian optical vortex with a topological charge n after passing through a cylindrical lens. With a special choice of the ellipticity degree (1: 3), such a beam retains its structure upon propagation and the degenerate intensity null on the optical axis does not  split into n optical vortices. Such a beam has fractional orbital angular momentum not equal to n. The third type is the astigmatic Hermite-Gaussian beam (HG) of order (n, 0), which is generated when a HG beam passes through a cylindrical lens. The cylindrical lens brings the orbital angular momentum into the original HG beam. The orbital angular momentum of such a beam is the sum of the vortex and astigmatic components, and can reach large values (tens and hundreds of thousands per photon). Under certain conditions, the zero intensity lines of the HG beam  merge into an n-fold degenerate intensity null on the optical axis, and the orbital angular momentum of such a beam is equal to n. Using intensity distributions of the astigmatic HG beam in foci of two cylindrical lenses, we calculate the normalized orbital angular momentum which differs only by 7 % from its theoretical orbital angular momentum value (experimental orbital angular momentum is -13,62, theoretical OAM is -14.76).

ABSTRACT: A great variety of tunable multifunctional materials can be produced by combining nanoparticles and liquid crystals. Typically, the tunability of such soft nanocomposites is achieved via external electric fields resulting in the field-induced reorientation of liquid crystals. This reorientation can be altered by ions normally present in liquid crystals in small quantities. In addition, nanomaterials dispersed in liquid crystals can also affect the behavior of ions. Therefore, an understanding of ionic phenomena in liquid crystals doped with nanoparticles is essential for future advances in liquid crystal-aided nanoscience and nanotechnology. This paper provides an overview of the ionic effects observed in liquid crystals doped with nanomaterials. An introduction to liquid crystals is followed by a brief overview of nanomaterials in liquid crystals. After giving a basic description of ions in liquid crystals and experimental methods to measure them, a wide range of ionic phenomena in liquid crystals doped with different types of nanomaterials is discussed. After that, both existing and emerging applications of tunable soft materials made of liquid crystals and nanodopants are presented with an emphasis on the role of ionic effects in such systems. Finally, the discussion of unsolved problems and future research directions completes the review.

ABSTRACT: The problem of network coding resource optimization with a known topological structure is NP-hard. Traditional quantum genetic algorithms have the disadvantages of slow convergence and difficulty in finding the optimal solution when dealing with this problem. To overcome these disadvantages, this paper proposes an adaptive quantum genetic algorithm based on the cooperative mutation of gene number and fitness (GNF-QGA). This GNF-QGA adopts the rotation angle adaptive adjustment mechanism. To avoid excessive illegal individuals, an illegal solution adjustment mechanism is added to the GNF-QGA. A solid demonstration was provided that the proposed algorithm has a fast convergence speed and good optimization capability when solving network coding resource optimization problems.

ABSTRACT: Chiroptical response, demonstrating chiral interaction between optical vortex and chiral structure, plays an important role in variety of fields like optics and material science. However, the flexibility and efficiency of chiral structure fabrication are limited due to mask requirement and a point-by-point constructing strategy. In this paper, a novel chiral lithography method is proposed that utilizes optical vortex phase beam shaping to achieve chiral structure processing with high efficiency and flexibility. By programming topological charges of the vortex phase, chiral structures with adjustable appearance, rotation, and chirality can be produced using femtosecond laser single pulse exposure. Transmittance measurements of fabricated chiral structures array confirm a 66% helical dichroism that is predicted by simulation. Moreover, with the aid of convolutional neural networks (CNN), an accuracy of 98% in Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) recognition can be achieved. This chiral lithography method provides an alternative for chiral structure fabrication and holds promise in the development of chiral optics, optical communications, and next-generation optical devices. A novel chiral lithography method is proposed to achieve chiral structure processing with high efficiency and flexibility using optical vortex beam. Chiral structures with adjustable appearance, rotation, and chirality are produced using femtosecond laser single pulse exposure by programming topological charges of the vortex phase. Based on the dichroism of chiral arrays, recognition of incident Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) can be realized.image

ABSTRACT: The upconversion of an orbital angular momentum (OAM) carried light in communication band is preferable for building OAM-based upconversion optical communication networks. Here we experimentally study the behavior of OAM of communication band light in sum frequency generation process. The wavelength of the pump beam with sub-nanosecond pumping fields is 1064 nm and the communication band light is 1560 nm. Both beams are imprinted with OAM using vortex phase plates. The topological charges of the upconversion pulses at 632.5 nm are observed by a self-referenced interferometric technique. The OAM conserves in coupled nonlinear optical conversions is confirmed by counting the fringes in the interference intensity profile. The sum frequency generation is performed by using a periodically poled MgO-doped lithium niobate (PPLN) crystal under quasi-phase-matching conditions. We also gave analytical expressions for the upconversion of two OAM-carrying beams. The experimental results are well matched with the theoretical simulations.

ABSTRACT: It is shown theoretically and numerically that circularly and linearly polarized incident beams produce at the tight focus identical circularly symmetric distributions of an on-axis energy flux. It is also shown that the on-axis energy fluxes from radially and azimuthally polarized optical vortices with unit topological charge are equal to each other. An optical vortex with azimuthal polarization is found to generate the minimum focal spot measured for the intensity (all other parameters being equal). Slightly larger (by a fraction of a percent) is the spot size calculated for the energy flux for the circularly and linearly polarized light. The spot size in terms of intensity is of importance in light-matter interaction, whereas the spot size in terms of energy flux affects the resolution in optical microscopy.

ABSTRACT: The construction of uniform orientation of crystallographic direction of blue phase is of great importance for its practical applications and the scientific research of multi-dimensional controllable growth of soft matter. With the consideration of the weak thermal stability of blue phase, the uniform lattice orientation of blue phase is combined with localized polymer-stabilization in this work. So the relatively stable fabrication of micro-patterns for blue phase can be realized, and it is promising for researchers to prepare brand new photonic devices. To the best of our knowledge, the relevant reports are rather rare, and the successful implementation of the above ideas is full of difficulties according to current conditions. In this paper, the uniform, patterned and stable orientation of crystallographic direction of blue phase is achieved by using the aforementioned integrated method. Here in this work, facile rubbing alignment is used as the primary way to realize the uniform lattice orientation. Meanwhile, the polymer-stabilization, as an effective technological way, is used to stabilize the frustrated topological structure of aligned blue phase for a better stability and its application perspective. Furthermore, we construct the well-defined micro-patterned blue phase array including one-dimensional and two-dimensional pattern in virtue of facile and effective localized exposure. Simultaneously, the stability of such a micro-pattern under external field is also investigated to evaluate the validity of stabilized superstructure and characteristic behavior of unstable region. As a result, the micro-patterned blue phase array keeps good state even under the adequate exposure to high voltage. Finally, the potential photonic application is explored based on the above micro-patterns which exhibit good optical diffraction effects in the experiment that follows. In conclusion, it really provides a feasible route for achieving stable control about orientation of soft matter, like liquid crystal, and fabricating field-stable and periodic superstructure. Such a research will speed up the development of blue phase liquid crystal in crystallography, electronics, and photonics.

ABSTRACT: We firstly develop a straightforward method to generate full Poincare beams with any polarization geometry over an arbitrary order Poincare sphere. We implement this by coaxial superposition of two orthogonal circular polarized beams with alternative topological charges with the help of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. Secondly we find the existence of singularity points. And the inner relationship between their characteristics and the order of Poincare spheres is also studied. In summary, this work provides a convenient and effective way to generate vector beams and to control their polarization states.

ABSTRACT: A fibre bundle viewpoint of gauge field theories is reviewed with focus on a possible quantum interpretation. The fundamental quantum properties of non-separability of state spaces is considered in the context of defining the connection on the fibre bundle, leading to an application of the quantum principles to the geometrical and topological definition of gauge theories. As a result, one could justifiably ask oneself if all interactions of the standard model, and perhaps even classical gravity have some quantum component after all. I employ a standard fibre bundle approach to introduce gauge theories, albeit it is known that a quantum bundle exists, simply because the main scope is to show that in the usual way in which we formulate classical gauge theories one can find quantum aspects that have been unknown until now. In a sense, I will try to justify the assessment that if we are to allow for gauge fields and parallel transport, we may have to allow at least some level of quantumness even in our classical gauge theories. The main statement is that propagation of interactions in spacetime is a quantum phenomenon. After writing the first draft of this article I noticed Y Shen C. Rosales-Guzman 2022 Laser & Photonics Reviews, 16,2100533 where the authors device entanglement of what they call 'classical light'. This experiment supports my theoretical developments with the distinction that I interpret such phenomena also as fundamentally quantum. The distinction comes from the fact that the quantum nature of the experiments is manifested in a different way. My view on this is that there is no purely classical reality, no matter what the scale is at which we consider the description. I also discuss the fact that observing a quantum nature of 'classical' light propagation would amount to the requirement of modifying the causal structure defined in terms of the speed of light in a vacuum, on stronger grounds, based on the quantum interpretation of gauge connections.

ABSTRACT: The advent of topological semi-metals with peculiar band structure and exotic quantum-transport provides novel pathways for upgrading the performance of terahertz (THz) detection. HgTe is among such a candidate with the unique advantages of a negative bandgap, ultra-high mobility, and thermoelectricity, which ignites the possibility of addressing the technical bottlenecks of traditional routes for THz detection. Herein, for the first time, we report large-area (3 in.) growth of high-mobility HgTe thin-film via molecular-beam epitaxial and the implementation of bow-tie antennas based HgTe THz-detector with the abilities of ultrafast response, low noise, and high ambient-stability at room temperature. By exploration of strong light-coupling and superior hot-carrier transport, the bow-tie antenna-based HgTe photodetector can achieve a responsivity of 0.04 A/W and a noise equivalent power of less than 0.6 nW/Hz(1/2) at 0.3 THz. Furthermore, the sensitivity can be further improved by nearly an order of magnitude up to 0.36 A/W at 0.3 THz by incorporating a short channel asymmetric cubic resonator. The reported performances allow a realistic exploration of high-mobility bulk states in topological semimetals for large area, fast-imaging applications in the THz band.

ABSTRACT: A combinatorial and topological analysis has been performed and self-assembly of the Li48Na80Ga332-oF920 crystal structure has been simulated (sp. gr. Fmmm, a = 24.666 angstrom, b = 15.974 angstrom, c = 45.271 angstrom, V = 17837 angstrom(3)) using computer methods (the TOPOS program package). It is found that there are 11827 versions of cluster representation of an atomic 3D net with the number of structural units from 4 to 14. Two framework-forming icosahedral clusters ico-K124 and ico-K44 are determined. The chemical composition of the shells of the three-layer 124-atom nanocluster ico-K124 is 0@12(Ga-12)@32(Li20Ga12)@80(Li4Na16Ga60), its diameter is 17 angstrom, and the symmetry is mmm. The chemical composition of the shells of the two-layer 44-atom nanocluster ico-K44 is 0@12(Ga-12)@32(Li20Ga12), its diameter is 11 angstrom, and the symmetry is 2/m. The symmetry and topology code of self-assembly of the crystal structure has been reconstructed from ico-K124 and ico-K44 nanocluster precursors in the following form: primary chain -> layer -> framework. Ga-7 clusters and dual chains of Ga atoms occupy 3D-framework voids.

ABSTRACT:  AND COMPUTATIONAL BIOPHYSICS AND ANALYSIS OF BIOMEDICAL DATA IV" In this work, we fabricated and studied the performance of a 100x100-mu m four-sector binary subwavelength grating polarizer in a golden film. It was experimentally demonstrated that a linearly polarized 532-nm Gaussian beam reflected at the polarizer was converted to an azimuthally polarized beam. Putting a spiral phase plate (SPP) with the topological charge n = 1 into the azimuthally polarized beam from the micropolarizer was experimentally shown to enable the conversion of the annular intensity pattern into a central intensity peak.

ABSTRACT: Birefringent structures in liquid crystalline fluids, such as colloidal assemblies or topological defects, show high potential for use as photonic elements. Here, we present a brief overview of two photonic phenomena originating from coupling light fields with complex birefringent nematic profiles: (i) the generation of vector laser beams from simple Gaussian beams by propagating light along nematic discliantions, and (ii) tunable photonic crystals from blue phase colloidal crystals conditioned by the different underlying symmetries of the particle lattice and the blue phase birefringence. The polarization profile of initially simple linearly polarized Gaussian beams is shown to change into a defect structure at distinct distances travelled along the disclination with the topological invariant (winding number) of the light field and nematic director distinctly coupled. Upon pulsed laser illumination, the nematic discliantions are also shown to split the light pulse into multiple intensity regions. Blue phase I face centred cubic colloidal crystals are shown as examples of tunable photonic crystals, where local band-baps can open by differently combining the symmetries of the two components, e.g. by changing the particle size. The spatial profiles of selected photonic bands in the blue phase colloidal crystals are shown, finding the particles and blue phase double twist cylinders as possible carriers of high-light-intensity regions.

ABSTRACT: The extraordinary electronic properties of Dirac materials, the two-dimensional partners of Weyl semimetals, arise from the linear crossings in their band structure. When the dispersion around the Dirac points is tilted, one can predict the emergence of intricate transport phenomena such as modified Klein tunneling, intrinsic anomalous Hall effects, and ferrimagnetism. However, Dirac materials are rare, particularly with tilted Dirac cones. Recently, artificial materials whose building blocks present orbital degrees of freedom have appeared as promising candidates for the engineering of exotic Dirac dispersions. Here we take advantage of the orbital structure of photonic resonators arranged in a honeycomb lattice to implement photonic lattices with semi-Dirac, tilted, and, most interestingly, type-III Dirac cones that combine flat and linear dispersions. Type-III Dirac cones emerge from the touching of a flat and a parabolic band when synthetic photonic strain is introduced in the lattice, and they possess a nontrivial topological charge. This photonic realization provides a recipe for the synthesis of orbital Dirac matter with unconventional transport properties and, in combination with polariton nonlinearities, opens the way to study Dirac superfluids in topological landscapes.

ABSTRACT: Colloids are abundant in nature, science, and technology, with examples ranging from milk to quantum dots and the colloidal atom paradigm. Similarly, liquid crystal ordering is important in contexts ranging from biological membranes to laboratory models of cosmic strings and liquid crystal displays in consumer devices. Some of the most exciting recent developments in both of these soft matter fields emerge at their interface, in the fast-growing research arena of liquid crystal colloids. Mesoscale self-assembly in such systems may lead to artificial materials and to structures with emergent physical behavior arising from patterning of molecular order and nano-or microparticles into precisely controlled configurations. Liquid crystal colloids show exceptional promise for new discovery that may impinge on composite material fabrication, low-dimensional topology, photonics, and so on. Starting from physical underpinnings, I review the state of the art in this fast-growing field, with a focus on its scientific and technological potential.

ABSTRACT: Throughout optics and photonics, phase is normally controlled via an optical path difference. Although much less common, an alternative means for phase control exists: a geometric phase (GP) shift occurring when a light wave is transformed through one parameter space, e.g., polarization, in such a way as to create a change in a second parameter, e.g., phase. In thin films and surfaces where only the GP varies spatially-which may be called GP holograms (GPHs)-the phase profile of nearly any (physical or virtual) object can in principle be embodied as an inhomogeneous anisotropy manifesting exceptional diffraction and polarization behavior. Pure GP elements have had poor efficiency and utility up to now, except in isolated cases, due to the lack of fabrication techniques producing elements with an arbitrary spatially varying GP shift at visible and near-infrared wavelengths. Here, we describe two methods to create high-fidelity GPHs, one interferometric and another direct-write, capable of recording the wavefront of nearly any physical or virtual object. We employ photoaligned liquid crystals to record the patterns as an inhomogeneous optical axis profile in thin films with a few mu m thickness. We report on eight representative examples, including a GP lens with F/2.3 (at 633 nm) and 99% diffraction efficiency across visible wavelengths, and several GP vortex phase plates with excellent modal purity and remarkably small central defect size (e.g., 0.7 and 7 mu m for topological charges of 1 and 8, respectively). We also report on a GP Fourier hologram, a fan-out grid with dozens of far-field spots, and an elaborate phase profile, which showed excellent fidelity and very low leakage wave transmittance and haze. Together, these techniques are the first practical bases for arbitrary GPHs with essentially no loss, high phase gradients (similar to rad/mu m), novel polarization functionality, and broadband behavior.

ABSTRACT: Generally, an optical vortex lattice (OVL) is generated via the superposition of two specific vortex beams. Thus far, OVL has been successfully employed to trap atoms via the dark cores. The topological charge (TC) on each optical vortex (OV) in the lattice is only +/- 1. Consequently, the orbital angular momentum (OAM) on the lattice is ignored. To expand the potential applications, it is necessary to rediscover and exploit OAM. Here we propose a novel high-order OVL (HO-OVL) that combines the phase multiplication and the arbitrary mode-controllable techniques. TC on each OV in the lattice is up to 51, which generates sufficient OAM to manipulate microparticles. Thereafter, the entire lattice can be modulated to desirable arbitrary modes. Finally, yeast cells are trapped and rotated by the proposed HO-OVL. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first realization of the complex motion of microparticles via OVL. Thus, this work successfully exploits OAM on OVL, thereby revealing potential applications in particle manipulation and optical tweezers.

ABSTRACT: Quantum entanglement will play an important role in future quantum technologies. Here, we theoretically study the steady-state entanglement between a cavity field and a macroscopic rotating mirror in a Laguerre-Gaussian-(LG)-cavity optomechanical system with cross-Kerr nonlinearity. Logarithmic negativity is used to quantify the steady-state entanglement between the cavity and mechanical modes. We analyze the impacts of the cross-Kerr coupling strength, the cavity detuning, the input laser power, the topological charge of the LG-cavity mode, and the temperature of the environment on the steady-state optomechanical entanglement. We find that cross-Kerr nonlinearity can significantly enhance steady-state optomechanical entanglement and make steady-state optomechanical entanglement more robust against the temperature of the thermal environment.

ABSTRACT: The combinatorial topological analysis and modeling of self-assembly of the Pu56Hg352-cF408 (a = 21.780 angstrom, V = 10331.75 angstrom(3), space group F-43m) and Zr4Pu112-tI116 ((a = b = 18.189 angstrom, c = 7.857 angstrom, V = 2599.86 angstrom(3), space group I4(1)/a) crystal structures are performed by computer methods (the ToposPro software package). The method of complete decomposition of the 3D structure graph into cluster structures was used to determine the framework-forming nanoclusters. For Pu56Hg352-cF408, 88 variants of decomposition of the 3D structure graph with the number of clusters from 2 to 6 were determined. New two-layer nanoclusters K26 = 0@Pu-4@Pu4Hg18 and K46 = 0@Hg6@Pu4Hg36 with -43m symmetry were found to form a 3D packing. The framework voids contain Hg-4 tetrahedral clusters and Hg spacer atoms. For Zr4Pu112-tI116, framework-forming nanoclusters K17 = Zr@Pu16 with -4 symmetry are installed. The framework voids contain Pu-4 tetrahedra and Pu spacer atoms.

ABSTRACT: In this paper, we present an approach called the free lens modulation (FLM) method to generate high-perfection 3D generalized perfect optical vortices (GPOVs) with topological charges of 1-80. In addition, 2D and 3D GPOVs were produced by altering the parameters of the freely shaped lenses. To verify the quality of the GPOVs produced with the FLM method, we conducted optical trapping experiments and realized linear control of the rotation rate of the trapped particle. Due to the great advantages of high perfection and high power usage in generating arbitrarily shaped GPOVs, the FLM method is expected to be applied in optical manipulation, optical communications, and other fields.

ABSTRACT: Higher-order vortices (HOVs) extend the dimensions of optical vortex regulation, which is of great significance in optical communication and optical tweezers. Herein, we demonstrate an alternative scheme to produce a HOV in the focus plane using multiple Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beam interference, termed a discrete higher-order optical vortex lattice (DHOVL). The modulation depth of the DHOVL exceeds 2 pi. In this case, the topological charge (TC) of the DHOVL is determined by the difference of the phase period between the innermost and the outermost interference beams. Compared with a conventional HOV (CHOV), the vortex exists in a form of multiple unit singularities sharing a dark core. In addition, the average orbital angular momentum per photon of the DHOVL increases with increasing TC, surpassing that of the CHOV. This work provides a novel, to the best of our knowledge, scheme to produce a HOV, which will facilitate several advanced applications, including optical micromanipulation, optical sensing and imaging, and optical fabrication.(c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group

ABSTRACT: Topological defects in liquid crystals not only affect the optical and rheological properties of the host, but can also act as scaffolds in which to trap nano or micro-sized colloidal objects. The creation of complex defect shapes, however, often involves confining the liquid crystals in curved geometries or adds complex-shaped colloidal objects, which are unsuitable for device applications. Using topologically patterned substrates, here we demonstrate the controlled generation of three-dimensional defect lines with non-trivial shapes and even chirality, in a flat slab of nematic liquid crystal. By using the defect lines as templates and the electric response of the liquid crystals, colloidal superstructures are constructed, which can be reversibly reconfigured at a voltage as low as 1.3V. Three-dimensional engineering of the defect shapes in liquid crystals is potentially useful in the fabrication of self-healing composites and in stabilizing artificial frustrated phases.

ABSTRACT: Thus far, the studies of unidirectional transmission based on nontrivial photonic topological states have mostly relied on precisely designed periodic structures. To realize unidirectional transmission on a continuous homogeneous interface, a hyperbolic-gyroelectric metamaterial composed of alternating dielectric and magnetized semiconductor layers is proposed. The application of an externally applied magnetic field along the stacking direction of dielectric and magnetized semiconductor layers leads to the breaking of the time-reversal symmetry and the separation of the bulk modes of the metamaterial. The existence of the surface states in the spatial gap between two bulk modes of the metamaterial is verified by analytical calculation. The unidirectionality and the backscattering-immune properties of the surface states are further demonstrated by numerical simulation of electromagnetic waves propagation along interfaces with sharp corners. By connecting the interfaces of two identical hyperbolic-gyroelectric metamaterials with reversed magnetic fields, the number of unidirectional surface states is doubled. As a possible application of multimode surface states, a continuously tunable power splitter is proposed.

ABSTRACT: The industrialization and commercialization of optoelectronic devices require the exploration of novel materials with high stability, nontoxicity, and large-scale manufacturing. The all-inorganic lead-free halide perovskite nanomaterial CsCu2I3 has been widely reported in applications in light-emitting diodes (LEDs), photodetectors (PDs), photovoltaics, and so on, due to its good environmental stability and unique optoelectronic properties. However, research on ultrafast photonics has rarely been carried out so far. Here, high quality CsCu2I3 micro-rods were fabricated via a solvent evaporation crystallization method. The high thermodynamic stability and the broadband response of CsCu2I3-based optoelectronic devices have been predicted by density functional theory (DFT), revealing their feasibility for exploitation in fiber laser systems. The nonlinear characteristic of CsCu2I3 micro-rods was measured using a balanced twin-detector system, with a modulation depth of 12.04%. Utilizing its remarkable nonlinear optical response and intrinsic stability, a passively mode-locked erbium-doped fiber laser based on a CsCu2I3 saturable absorber was achieved. Significantly, the fiber laser could operate stably for at least five months. These experimental results demonstrate that CsCu2I3 micro-rods are ultra-stable, and can serve as a promising optical modulation material to produce an ultrafast and long-stability pulse in fiber laser applications.

ABSTRACT: We demonstrate a synthetic Hall effect for light, using an acousto-optically modulated nanophotonic resonator chain. To produce this effect, we simultaneously generate the required synthetic electric field using temporal modulation and the required synthetic magnetic field using spatial modulation of the resonator chain. We show how the combination of these synthetic fields transverse to the direction of light propagation can be used to produce non-reciprocal optical transmission, as a basis for new photonic and topological devices.

ABSTRACT: Photonic bound states in the continuum (BICs) are eigenmodes with an infinite lifetime, which coexist with a continuous spectrum of radiating waves. BICs are not only of great theoretical interest but also have a wide range of practical applications, e.g. in the design of optical resonators. Here, we study this phenomenon in a new integrated nanophotonic element consisting of a single dielectric ridge terminating an abruptly ended slab waveguide. This structure can be considered as an on-chip analog of the Gires-Tournois interferometer (GTI). We demonstrate that the proposed integrated structure supports high-Q phase resonances and robust BICs. We develop a simple but extremely accurate coupled-wave model that clarifies the physics of BIC formation and enables predicting BIC locations. The developed model shows that the studied BICs are topologically protected and describes the strong phase resonance effect that occurs when two BICs with opposite topological charges annihilate.

ABSTRACT: In the field of optical communications and quantum informatics, polarization and orbital angular momentum (OAM) offer a promising way to expand the dimension of information. However, detecting the polarization state and topological charge of the OAM beam on-chip way can be challenging. To address this, an ultracompact metasurface is proposed and demonstrated. The metasurface is composed of six polarization-sensitive metalenses that occupy 60 degrees annular sectors each and are capable of simultaneous polarization state and orbital angular momentum detection. The metasurface focuses the coaxial polarized vortex beam into six locations, and the foci displacement is related to the value of the topological charge. The corresponding polarization state can be obtained through the reconstructed Stokes parameter using the six focus light intensities. For proof-of-concept, an ultracompact metasurface operating at a wavelength of 1064 nm is fabricated, which exhibits exceptional polarization and orbital angular momentum recognition ability. The proposed metasurface possesses the merits of ultra-compact size and simultaneously entire polarization state and orbital angular momentum identification capability, which may encourage the development of on-chip optical communication systems. Considering the high desire to identify both full polarization and OAM eigenstates, an ultracompact metasurface consisting of six polarization-sensitive metalens, each of which occupies a 60 degrees annular sector, is designed. The metasurface possesses the merits of ultra-compact size and simultaneously full polarization state and orbital angular momentum identification capability, which may encourage the development of on-chip optical communication systems.image

ABSTRACT: It was shown that tightly focused cylindrical vector beam of m-th order produces reverse energy flow in the focal plane (m=2). If m=3 the reverse energy flow on the axis is equal to zero and near the axis it increases in proportion to a square of the distance to the axis. The azimuthally polarized beam of the m-th order is an example of a polarization vortex. Previously, the reverse energy flow in the focus was obtained only for vortex beams with a topological charge m and circular polarization. Numerically, using the FDTD method and the Richards-Wolf formulae, it was shown that in the focus of the zone plate such laser beams produce regions the Poynting vector opposite to the direction of propagation of the beam.

ABSTRACT: Rigorous, computationally efficient method of mode-field calculation in multilayer optical fibers based on a new algorithm for building up matrix eigenvalue equation is presented. For an arbitrary number of dielectric, metallic, semiconductor, or topological insulator layers, the cylindrical wave equations are solvable exactly both for guided and lossy modes. Lossy mode resonance in a fiber taper prepared by etching out of a significant part of silica cladding and coated with an ultrathin ZnTe film is described as an example. It is shown that in this case the lossy mode resonance is a consequence of two mode coupling in a transient wavelength region in which these modes transform form guided into lossy type and vice versa.

ABSTRACT: Strong light-matter coupling means that cavity photons and other types of matter excitations are coherently exchanged. It is used to couple different qubits (matter) via a quantum bus (photons) or to communicate different types of excitations, e.g., transducing light into phonons or magnons. A, so far, unexplored interface is the coupling between light and topologically protected particle-like excitations as magnetic domain walls, skyrmions, or vortices. Here, we show theoretically that a single photon living in a super-conducting cavity can be strongly coupled to the gyrotropic mode of a magnetic vortex in a nanodisc. We combine numerical and analytical calculations for a superconducting coplanar waveguide resonator and different realizations of the nanodisc (materials and sizes). We show that, for enhancing the coupling, constrictions fabricated in the resonator are crucial, allowing to reach strong coupling in CoFe discs of radius 200-400 nm having resonance frequencies of a few GHz. The strong coupling regime permits coherently exchanging a single photon and quanta of vortex gyration. Thus, our calculations show that the device proposed here serves as a transducer between photons and gyrating vortices, opening the way to complement superconducting qubits with topologically protected spin-excitations such as vortices or skyrmions. We finish by discussing potential applications in quantum data processing based on the exploitation of the vortex as a short-wavelength magnon emitter.

ABSTRACT: The phenomenological theory revealing the generic effects of the problem symmetry, its violation, and energy conservation law on the singularities of the Poynting vector field is presented. The bifurcation scenario of formation (annihilation) of the singularities under variations of the problem parameters is elucidated. The results describe the singularities in scattering a linearly polarized plane electromagnetic wave. However, they are valid for any configuration of the incident beam at its scattering by a subwavelength particle. The author shows that topological changes in the pattern of the Poynting vector field occur through a finite number of pitchfork bifurcations. It means that the patterns are topologically stable under variations of the problem parameter(s) that lie between the bifurcation values. The latter ensures that the discussed topological properties of the problem are robust to weak symmetry violation, which is inevitable in any actual experiment. The general consideration is illustrated by a detailed study of singularities in scattering by an infinite right circular germanium cylinder. The results open the possibility of fitting and controlling radiation patterns on subwavelength scales important for various nanotechnologies. The phenomenological theory describing the bifurcation scenario for the creation (annihilation) of singular points in the Poynting vector field at resonant light scattering by a subwavelength particle is presented. The effects of energy conservation law, symmetry, and its violation are elucidated. The results can be used to tailor and control the field pattern on a subwavelength scale.image

ABSTRACT: On-chip integrated orbital angular momentum (OAM) sorting is of great importance in tackling the severe challenge of exponential growth in data traffic. Despite the continuous success, current demultiplexing techniques either scarify efficiency dramatically or lose the compactness of a system. Here we experimentally demonstrate an ultracompact OAM sorter using TiO2 metasurfaces integrated onto a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) camera. By utilizing the propagation phases, we transfer the unitary transformation theory in bulky systems into two TiO2 metasurfaces, responsible for the functions of log-polar transformation and fan-out beam copying and focusing as well as the functions of phase correction and Fourier transform. The flatform metasurface doublet enables one to integrate the OAM sorter onto a camera chip. Consequently, OAM beams with topological charges of m = -3 to 3 were separated by a CMOS camera with an average crosstalk of -6.43 dB. This approach shall shed light on next-generation OAM modes processing.

ABSTRACT: Optical vortex (OV) beams are widely used for the generation of light fields with transverse energy flow inducing orbital motion of the nano- and microparticles in the transverse plane. Here, we present some new modifications of OV beams with autofocusing properties for shaping complex transverse energy flow distributions varying in space. The angular component of the complex amplitude of these beams is defined by the superpositions of OV beams with different topological charges. The proposed approach provides a convenient method to control the three-dimensional structure of the generated autofocusing OV beams. The control of the transverse distribution of an autofocusing beam provides a wide variety of generated fields with both rotating and periodic properties, which can be used in the field of laser manipulation and laser material processing. Thus, the obtained numerical results predict different types of motion of the trapped particles for the designed OV autofocusing beams. The experimental results agree with modeling results and demonstrate the principal possibility to shape such laser beams using spatial light modulators.

ABSTRACT: We proposed the perfect vector optical vortex arrays (PVOVAs) for encoding and decoding communications, including the 2 x 2, 1 x 4, 4 x 4, and 2 x 4 array forms, which were generated with the coaxial superposition of two vector optical vortex arrays with left- and right-handed circular polarization. The polarization order and state of each vector element could be modulated independently by adjusting the corresponding topological charges and additional phases, theta(n) . By attaching code information to these vector elements with different states of polarization, the hexadecimal code elements, including 0 to F, were represented. Therefore, PVOVAs consisting of multiple vector elements can transmit encoding information and be decoded as original information in the receiving end. The school badge grayscale image, with a size of 64 x 64 pixels, was transmitted using the encoding and decoding communication via PVOVAs, and the received restored image had a reliable accuracy. This study proves PVOVAs have flexible spatial structure and controllable states of polarization, and it expands the application of vector optical fields in optical encoding and decoding communication.

ABSTRACT: Structured light is derived from the ability to tailor light, usually referring to the spatial control of its amplitude, phase, and polarization. Although a venerable topic that dates back to the very first laser designs, structuring light at the source has seen an explosion in activity over the past decade, fuelled by a modern toolkit that exploits the versatility of diffractive structures, liquid crystals, metasurfaces/metamaterials, and exotic laser geometries, as well as a myriad of applications that range from imaging, microscopy, and laser material processing to optical communication. Here, the recent progress in creating and controlling structured light is reviewed, with particular emphasis on structuring light at the source: structured light lasers. The various design approaches, including pump shaping, cavity geometries, and the use of custom intracavity optical elements, implemented in a variety of lasers from microchip solutions to high-power fibers are covered in a tutorial style. The history and latest developments in the field are reviewed, elucidating the various structured light patterns that have been created from lasers, including orbital angular momentum and vector states of light. Finally, the present challenges and limitations are highlighted, along with comments on likely future trends.

ABSTRACT: "Thin-film samples of fluorides CaF2, BaF2, and LaF3, free of oxyfluorides, have been fabricated by ultrasonic fragmentation (CaF2) and sublimation in vacuum onto amorphous carbon substrates (BaF2 and LaF3). The electron diffraction patterns of these polycrystals are measured with a low statistical error (1-2%) using an EMR-102 electron diffractometer. The reflection intensities were applied to refine the electronic structure  the refinement showed mainly ionic character of chemical bonding in these compounds. Electron density and electrostatic potential distributions were obtained using the parameters of kappa-model, which describes ionic bonding, and their quantitative analysis was performed within Bader's topological approach. It is noted that the positions of critical points in the electrostatic potential and electron density maps for CaF2, BaF2, and LaF3 crystals do not exactly coincide. This finding has confirmed the well-known fact: the electron density (and energy) of a many-electron system is not completely determined by the innercrystalline electrostatic field. The electron density and electrostatic potential maps supplement each other when describing interatomic interactions. A consideration of the gradient field E(r) = -delta phi(r) in these crystals confirms the conclusion that long-range Coulomb interactions of atoms (having finite sizes) occur in the form of atom atom interactions. The interaction forces and their directions in crystal is a peculiar property of each compound (specifically, each structure type)."

ABSTRACT: "Recently, the attention has been increased to the study of the connectivity properties and to the topology of the complex networks. This paper studies the relationship between the influential node and the topological structure of a network. Identification of influential nodes receives paramount interest as it is important for many real-world applications to identify strategically important nodes in different networks including social networks. Several node centrality measures are there for the identification of influential node. To overcome the limitations of well-known centrality measures like degree centrality, closeness centrality, and betweenness centrality, two more techniques are considered  one based on local properties of nodes (localarea centrality) and another based on global properties of the network (structural centrality). This paper investigates the role of local properties and position of the node with respect to the entire network for influential node identification with these algorithms. The experimental result shows that local-area centrality and structural centrality algorithms are able to identify the influential node with less computation time and effectiveness compared to other algorithms."

ABSTRACT: "Optical nanofiber cavity research has mainly focused on the fundamental mode. Here, a Fabry-Perot fiber cavity with an optical nanofiber supporting the higher-order modes (TE01, TM01, HEo21, and HEe21) is demonstrated. Using cavity spectroscopy, with mode imaging and analysis, we observed cavity resonances that exhibited com-plex, inhomogeneous states of polarization with topological features containing Stokes singularities such as C-points, Poincare vortices, and L-lines. In situ tuning of the intracavity birefringence enabled the desired profile and polarization of the cavity mode to be obtained. We believe these findings open new research possibilities for cold atom manipulation and multimode cavity quantum electrodynamics using the evanescent fields of higher-order mode optical nanofibers.& COPY  2023 Chinese Laser Press"

ABSTRACT: In recent years, singular light beams with orbital angular momentum are one of the most striking examples of structured light that have been widely applied in modern science. The transition from the generation of a single vortex beam to the generation of multiple such beams progressed the development of singular optics. This paper presents a new efficient method of vortex laser beam splitting using a two-level pure-phase diffractive optical element. The proposed compact element, which can be easily implemented with a low-cost binary spatial light modulator or fabricated by electron beam lithography or photolithography, is a useful tool for the reconfigurable generation of multiple closed-packed vortex beams. Furthermore, the proposed splitter can efficiently operate in the wavelength range of approximately 8% of the central wavelength, thus providing an efficient method to generate optical vortex arrays with various potential applications in modern optics and photonics.

ABSTRACT: The caustics of vortex optical beams have been investigated. An asymptotic method of calculating vortex-beam caustic surfaces is developed. The statement of the inverse problem of the formation of axial caustics of the desired form is considered. It is shown that the presence of the vortex component leads to the formation of an axisymmetric caustic surface, the characteristic diameter of which increases with an increase in the topological charge.

ABSTRACT: A coherence vortex (CV) carrying topological-charge information in its correlation dimension is a new option for optical manipulation and communication. CV generation by directly modulating the correlation function enables a way to control the light field in this dimension. However, few experimental realizations on this issue have been reported because of the difficulty in phase modulation when the light arrays are of low coherence. In this paper, we propose a method for generating a CV by utilizing partially coherent light arrays. A proper design of random arrays at the input plane leads to a complex CV field at the output plane after free-space propagation. This generation mechanism works well for beamlets of low coherence.

ABSTRACT: We demonstrate numerically and experimentally the generation of powerful supercontinuum vortices from femtosecond vortex beams by using multiple thin fused silica plates. The supercontinuum vortices are shown to preserve the vortex phase profile of the initial beam for spectral components ranging from 500 nm to 1200 nm. The transfer of the vortex phase profile results from the inhibition of multiple filamentation and the preservation of the vortex ring with relatively uniform intensity distribution by means of the thin-plate scheme, where the supercontinuum is mainly generated from the self-phase modulation and self-steepening effects. Our scheme works for vortex beams with different topological charges, which provides a simple and effective method to generate supercontinuum vortices with high power. (C) 2022 Chinese Laser Press

ABSTRACT: The orbital angular momentum (OAM) carried by photons defines an infinitely dimensional discrete Hilbert space. With OAM modes, high-dimensional quantum states can be achieved for quantum communication and cryptography. Here we demonstrate a heralded single-photon source with a switchable OAM mode, which consists of a heralded single-photon source and an integrated OAM emitter as the mode converter. As the first step, the heralded single-photon source is based on the dispersion-shifted fiber. In this work, the OAM mode (quantized by topological charge l) carried by the heralded single photon (at fixed wavelength of 1555.75 nm) can be switched within the range of l = 3-7 while the mode purity is more than 80%.

ABSTRACT: It is well known that bright vortex solitons are unstable in the ?(2) nonlinear media due to the strong azimuthal modulation instability. To solve this problem, a quadratic (?(2)) LiNbO3 ferroelectric crystal with a special kind of helical-periodically poled structure is proposed. The proposed structure is designed by embedding topological charges into the crystal with a quasi-phase matching technique. Simulation results indicate that vortex solitons containing fundamental-frequency and second-harmonic waves can robustly propagate over a distance. Two types of vortex states are obtained: double vortices state and vortex-antivortex state. The dependence of effective area, propagation constants, and maximum light intensity on the control parameters are presented. These results provide a new solution for robust transmission of bright vortex solitons in a ?((2)) nonlinear media.

ABSTRACT: A three-level spiral metalens in an amorphous silicon film is designed. The metalens relief consists of two subwavelength gratings with a 220-nm period (for 633 nm wavelength) and depths of 90 and 170 nm. The metalens forms a left-hand circular polarized optical vortex with topological charge 2 when illuminated by a linearly polarized plane wave. The intensity distribution at a distance of 633 nm is in the form of a subwavelength circle, whereas the longitudinal projection of the Pointing vector has negative values on the optical axis, meaning that a backward energy flow occurs. Two subwavelength gratings with different depth act as quarter-wave plates, transforming linearly polarized light into circularly polarized light with a phase delay of lambda/2. This metalens combines functionalities of three optical elements: a quarter-wave plate, a spiral phase plate, and a high-NA diffraction metalens (NA close to unity).

ABSTRACT: We consider sharp focusing of an axial superposition of two optical vortices with identical topological charges, but different amplitudes and circular polarizations of different signs. The ratio of the amplitudes of the two beams is a parameter. When this parameter changes, the polarization state of the superposition changes from linear polarization to right-hand circular polarization. Based on the Richards-Wolf theory, exact expressions are obtained for the longitudinal components of the spin angular momentum (SAM) density and orbital angular momentum (OAM) density at the focus of the considered superposition. It follows from these expressions that the sum of the total longitudinal components of the SAM and OAM is conserved upon focusing, and also that, due to the spin-orbit conversion, the total longitudinal component of the SAM decreases during focusing, while the total longitudinal component of the OAM increases by the same amount. By changing the ratio of the amplitudes of the constituent beams from 1 to 0, one can change the value of the spin-orbit conversion from zero (for linear polarization) to a maximum (for circular polarization). Also, by changing this parameter, one can control the spin Hall effect at the focus, which takes place at the focus of the considered beam. This study can be applied for controlling the rotation velocity of microparticles trapped in the focus.

ABSTRACT: We demonstrate the generation of versatile mode-locked operations in an Er-doped fiber laser with an indium tin oxide (ITO) saturable absorber (SA). As an epsilon-near-zero material, ITO has been only used to fashion a mode-locked fiber laser as an ITO nanoparticle-polyvinyl alcohol SA. However, this type of SA cannot work at high power or ensure that the SA materials can be transmitted by the light. Thus, we covered the end face of a fiber with a uniform ITO film using the radio frequency magnetron sputtering technology to fabricate a novel ITO SA. Using this new type of SA, single-wavelength pulses, dual-wavelength pulses, and triple-wavelength multi-pulses were achieved easily. The pulse durations of these mode-locked operations were 1.67, 6.91, and 1 ns, respectively. At the dual-wavelength mode-locked state, the fiber laser could achieve an output power of 2.91 mW and a pulse energy of 1.48 nJ. This study reveals that such a proposed film-type ITO SA has excellent nonlinear absorption properties, which can promote the application of ITO film for ultrafast photonics.

ABSTRACT: A new type of saturable absorber (SA) based on indium tin oxide (ITO) nanocrystals for passively Q-switched erbium-doped fiber (EDF) laser has been demonstrated experimentally. High quality ITO nanocrystals were prepared by the coprecipitation method. As a degenerate oxide semiconductor, the ITO has a wide range of saturable absorption regions, strong plasmonic absorption peaks, and ultra-fast recovery time. The nonlinear absorption properties of ITO are investigated by a balanced twin-detector measurement system. The saturation intensity and modulation depths are 9.87 MW/cm(2) and 0.83%, respectively. We successfully fabricated ITO SAs by depositing the ITO dispersion solution at the end of a fiber connector. By inserting the ITO SAs into an EDF fiber cavity, stable passively Q-switched pulses with the minimum pulse width of 1.15 mu s under a repetition rate of 81.28 kHz were obtained. The maximum output power of 1722 mu W and pulse energy of 21.19 nJ were realized when the pump power was 480 mW at the wavelength of 1530.3 nm. The results suggest that ITO nanocrystals are expected to develop into another effective SA for ultrafast photonics. (C) 2017 Optical Society of America

ABSTRACT: Tunable optical transitions in ultrathin layered 2-dimensional (2D) materials unveil the electronic structures of materials and provide exciting prospects for potential applications in optics and photonics. Here, we present our realization of dynamic optical modulation of layered metal chalcogenide nanoplates using ionic liquid (IL) gating over a wide spectral range. The IL gating significantly increased the tuning range of the Fermi level and, as a result, substantially altered the optical transitions in the nanoplates. Using heavily n-doped Bi2Se3 nanoplates, we substantially modulated the light transmission through the ultrathin layer. A tunable, high-transmission spectral window in the visible to near-infrared region has been observed due to simultaneous shifts of both the plasma edge and absorption edge of the material. On the other hand, optical response of multilayer MoSe2 flakes gated by IL has shown enhanced transmission in both positive and negative biases, which is consistent with their ambipolar electrical behavior. The electrically controlled optical property tuning in metal chalcogenide material systems provides new opportunities for potential applications, such as wide spectral range optical modulators, optical filters, and electrically controlled smart windows with extremely low material consumption.

ABSTRACT: Using Richards-Wolf formulae it is shown that a tightly focused azimuthally-radially polarized m-th order laser beam with an arbitrary apodization function produces a reverse energy flow in the focal plane (m=2). If m=3, the reverse energy flow on the axis is equal to zero, increasing in the axis vicinity as the square of the distance to the axis. The azimuthally-radially polarized beam of the m-th order is an example of a polarization vortex. Previously, the reverse energy flow in the focus was obtained only for circularly polarized vortex beams with the topological charge m. Using the FDTD method and the Richards-Wolf formulae, we show numerically that in the focus of a zone plate such laser beams produce regions where the Poynting vector is opposite to the direction of the beam propagation.

ABSTRACT: Using the plane waves expansion, we derive all six components of the E- and H-vectors for an elliptically polarized optical vortex with the arbitrary topological charge. Relations to describe the distributions of intensity and components of the Poynting vector in the initial plane of the optical vortex are also derived. In a particular case of the narrow angular spectrum of circularly polarized plane waves (Bessel beams), it is shown that if inhomogeneous evanescent waves are presented in the initial light field, a near-axis reverse flow of radiation can occur. An angular optical tractor effect is also shown to occur in the initial plane, in which at different radii from the optical axis the transverse energy flow rotates either clockwise or anticlockwise. The general relations derived can also be used to analyze peculiarities of the light flow for other known exact solutions of Maxwell's equations.

ABSTRACT: Based on a phase-modulated metallic nanoslit array, an angular momentum (AM) beam splitter has been demonstrated to distinguish both spin and orbital components carried by the light beam. With such a device, the AM modes could be coupled into nondiffracting surface plasmonic beams propagating toward different directions. According to the experimental results, the extinction ratio for spin AM beam splitting is larger than 10 and the spatial interval of adjacent orbital AM modes (with a topological charge interval of 2) is more than 1.1 mu m. We believe that such a device would have great potential to achieve a highly compact photonic integrated circuit with the plasmonic beam.

ABSTRACT: We show here that in the sharp focus of a linearly polarized laser beam the spin vector flux has only transverse components (the effect of photonic wheels or photonic helicopter). For a linearly polarized optical vortex, the orbit-spin conversion leads to the appearance of both longitudinal and transverse components of the spin density vector in the focus. Spin-orbit conversion is experimentally demonstrated for a circularly polarized Gaussian beam when a transverse energy flux (orbital angular momentum) arises in the focus, which is transmitted to a microparticle and makes it rotate. Switching the handedness of circular polarization (from left to right) switches the microparticle rotation direction. It is also shown here that an azimuthally polarized vortex beam with an arbitrary integer topological charge generates in the focus a spin density vector that only has an axial component (pure magnetization), while the transverse spin flux is absent.

ABSTRACT: The overall design of metamaterials are highly experience-dependent and time consuming, and meanwhile provide many degree of freedom in parameter configurations. Intelligent algorithms in the design and optimization of metamaterial aremuch more efficient than manual design when the massive trial and error are inevitable. In recent years, the bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm has attracted much attention because of its good performance on expensive electromagnetic simulation problems. Since BO is limit to continuous problems, we propose the compression mapping method to transform the discrete problem into a continuous problem and successfully apply the BO to the design of the topological structure of the metamaterial unit. We design a double-layer structure topology configuration frequency selection surface(FSS) to verify the effectiveness of the proposedmethod. Compared with some other intelligent algorithms, such as heuristic algorithm and neural network algorithm, BO aims to obtain a better result through less electromagnetic simulation times, which greatly shortens the time cost. Consequently, for the application of intelligent algorithms to design metamaterials, we provide a new idea and method to find an metamaterial structure in a relatively short period of time.

ABSTRACT: "Optical resonators with high quality (Q) factors are paramount for the enhancement of light-matter interactions in engineered photonic structures, but their performance always suffers from the scattering loss caused by fabrication imperfections. Merging bound states in the continuum (BICs) provide us with a nontrivial physical mechanism to overcome this challenge, as they can significantly improve the Q factors of quasi-BICs. However, most of the reported merging BICs are found at & UGamma  point (the center of the Brillouin zone), which intensively limits many potential applications based on angular selectivity. To date, studies on manipulating merging BICs at off-& UGamma  point are always accompanied by the breaking of structural symmetry that inevitably increases process difficulty and structural defects to a certain extent. Here, we propose a scheme to construct merging BICs at almost an arbitrary point in momentum space without breaking symmetry. Enabled by the topological features of BICs, we merge four accidental BICs with one symmetry-protected BIC at the & UGamma  point and merge two accidental BICs with opposite topological charges at the off-& UGamma  point only by changing the periodic constant of a photonic crystal slab. Furthermore, the position of off-& UGamma  merging BICs can be flexibly tuned by the periodic constant and height of the structure simultaneously. Interestingly, it is observed that the movement of BICs occurs in a quasi-flatband with ultra-narrow bandwidth. Therefore, merging BICs in a tiny band provide a mechanism to realize more robust ultrahigh-Q resonances that further improve the optical performance, which is limited by wide-angle illuminations. Finally, as an example of application, effective angle-insensitive second-harmonic generation assisted by different quasi-BICs is numerically demonstrated. Our findings demonstrate momentum-steerable merging BICs in a quasi-flatband, which may expand the application of BICs to the enhancement of frequency-sensitive light-matter interaction with angular selectivity. & COPY  2023 Chinese Laser Press"

ABSTRACT: Two-dimensional molecular crystals (2DMCs) are emerging ideal materials for future high-performance optoelectronic devices. People are constantly exploring new methods to solve the problem of difficult growth. Here, we design an improved chemical reaction-assisted vertical micro sublimation method based on vertical micro sublimation for the growth of two-dimensional Sb2O3 inorganic molecular crystals for the first time. The saturation absorption characteristics of the self-made Sb2O3 2DMCs were systematically tested, and the Q-switched laser output characteristics of Sb2O3 2DMCs at 1 mu m were verified by using Nd: GYAP mixed crystal. The maximum average output power of 231 mW was achieved at 1080.6 nm, corresponding shortest pulse with a duration of 472 ns and maximum pulse repetition rate of 376 kHz. The maximum single pulse energy and the maximum peak power of the laser output were 0.614 mu J and 1.3 W, respectively. The growth of other 2DMCs would be motivated and its potential applications in the field of ultrafast photonics would be expanded with our findings.

ABSTRACT: Twisted light carrying orbital angular momentum inherently possesses a handedness, which would produce chiroptical responses by chiral matter. In this work, a scheme of vortical differential scattering (VDS) was utilized to investigate the chiroptical responses of dielectric chiral particles to the twisted light. The simulation results showed that the dielectric chiral particles have obvious VDS signals under the illumination of twisted light with opposite topological charges. The larger the relative chiral parameter of the particles, the more obvious the VDS signals. The extreme value of the VDS signals can be enhanced by reducing the waist radius of the twisted light or by adopting the circularly polarized twisted light. In addition, non-spherical dielectric chiral particles exhibit more obvious VDS signals compared with spherical ones. These findings are expected to find potential applications in the detection and identification of chiral substances.

ABSTRACT: We study theoretically the simultaneous existence of large phononic and photonic bandgaps in chiral phoxonic crystals by topology optimization. By analyzing the effect of the chiral symmetry with different material orientations in both the square and triangular lattices, we discuss the most suitable structural properties for opening large phononic and photonic bandgap widths simultaneously and demonstrate the key role of the chiral topological feature. We also present the sensitivity analysis on the optimized phoxonic crystals and suggest the relatively robust structures. It will be shown that topology optimization can discover novel types of simple structures, offering new degrees of freedom to the beneficial design of phoxonic crystals for manipulating photons with phonons.

ABSTRACT: We demonstrate that the shape and the orientation of a surface plasmon (SP) vortex can be deterministically tailored through the geometrical design of a plasmonic Archimedes spiral (PAS). Noncircular SP vortices exhibiting c, triangular, and square patterns are successfully synthesized under circular polarized plane-wave excitations. We provide clear evidence that the topological charges of the shaped SP vortices are dominated by the PAS under all geometrical settings. Our analytical description for the vortices shows excellent agreement with numerical simulations. Our design principle provides unique opportunity to manipulate nanoscale intensity and phase distribution of optical field on a flat area and may find interesting applications in plasmonic optical trapping and subwavelength patterning.

ABSTRACT: Using the Kubo formalism we have calculated the local dynamic conductivity of a bulk, i.e., three-dimensional (3D), Dirac semimetal (BDS). We obtain that at frequencies lower than Fermi energy the metallic response in a BDS film manifests in the existence of surface-plasmon polaritons, but at higher frequencies the dielectric response is dominated and it occurs that a BDS film behaves as a dielectric waveguide. At this dielectric regime we predict the existence inside a BDS film of novel electromagnetic modes, a 3D analog of the transverse electric waves in graphene. We also find that the dielectric response manifests as the wide-angle passband in the mid-infrared (IR) transmission spectrum of light incident on aBDS film, which can be used for the interferenceless omnidirectional mid-IR filtering. The tuning of the Fermi level of the system allows us to switch between the metallic and the dielectric regimes and to change the frequency range of the predicted modes. This makes BDSs promising materials for photonics and plasmonics.

ABSTRACT: Magnetic Weyl semimetal shows intriguing properties in both fundamental physics and potential applications. However, the complex relationship between nonreciprocal transmission and magnetic field manipulation in magnetic Weyl semimetal systems has not been generally clarified and fully utilized. Here, a universal Chirality-Wavevector-Magnetic field (C-K-B) relation is established in the magnetic Weyl semimetal system, which completely describes the spin topological band and its intrinsic polarization output in full space orientation under an arbitrary magnetic vector. This relation can provide complete guidance for the device design of nonreciprocal spin manipulation. Coupling this nonreciprocal mechanism with the photonic spin Hall effect of the geometric phased metasurface, a magnetic Weyl semimetal metasurface is constructed in the terahertz (THz) range, The experiments demonstrate the flexible THz beam steerings in a broad spatial dispersion range of +/- 25-+/- 55 degrees with four different working modes by only altering the biased magnetic vectors. Moreover, all these beam steering processes are accompanied by nonreciprocal isolating transmission with the isolation ratio reaching 27 dB. This C-K-B relation and active nonreciprocal beam steering devices are expected to prompt magneto-optical devices and systems combined with echo isolation function in beam scanning, wavelength division multiplexing, and spin multiplexing. A universal Chirality-Wavevector-Magnetic field (C-K-B) relation is introduced for the magnetized Weyl semimetal InSb, which not only enables a quantitative analysis of the topological transmission properties but also unveils the manipulating properties inherent in magnetized Weyl semimetal system. Based on this, a magnetized semimetal metasurface is demonstrated, realizing an intriguing four states nonreciprocal manipulation.image

ABSTRACT: A new power-exponent-phase vortex beam with nonlinear phase winding has shown flexible control freedom compared with conventional vortex beams. In order to further enrich the modulation freedom and expand the ability of self-healing to meet current application requirements, we conducted a detailed study on the characteristics of the Airy transform of the new power-exponent-phase vortex beam. The influences of the Airy function, the power exponent, and the topological charge on normalized intensity and phase distributions are investigated theoretically and experimentally. More importantly, the self-healing properties of the new power-exponent-phase vortex beam with and without the Airy transform are compared. This shows that the new power-exponent-phase vortex beam with the Airy transform exhibits better self-healing ability when obstructed by obstacles. This study has potential applications in optical trapping and free-space optical communication.

ABSTRACT: Identifying and protecting traffic hub is vital to keep the stability and reliability of urban road traffic network. In this paper, a comprehensive evaluation method of node importance in urban road traffic network was introduced based on identification theory of key nodes in complex network. Firstly, taking into account the impact of road network topology and traffic flow characteristics on node's capacity, node importance in topological network and betweenness, urban road grade and node traffic flow are selected as the evaluating indexes of node importance, and AHP is used to determine the weight of each index. Secondly, the associated value of the indexes are calculated and obtained based on SuperMap Deskpro and practical investigation, and then, combined with TOPSIS, a sequence of node importance is determined. Finally, we applied the method to part district of Hohhot road traffic network, it can be seen that the key nodes obtained with the method stay in the important position in the the traffic network and have greater traffic flow, the results showed it is effective and practical feasible.

ABSTRACT: The mathematical concept of fractals is widely applied to photonics as planar structures ranging from terahertz resonators, optical antennas, to photodetectors. Here, instead of a direct mathematical abstract, we design a plasmonic leaf with fractal geometry from the outline of a leaf from Wargrave Pink. The enhanced light-matter interactions are observed numerically from the improvement in both absorption and near-field intensification. To demonstrate the effect experimentally, a three-dimensional fractal structure is realised through direct laser writing, which significantly improves the photothermal conversion. By virtue of the self-similarity in geometry, the artificial leaf improves the absorption of a 10-nm-thick gold film with 14 x temperature increment compared to flat Au film. Not limited to the proof-of-concept photothermal experiment demonstrated here, the fractal structure with improved light-matter interactions can be utilised in a variety of applications ranging from non-linear harmonic generation, plasmonic-enhanced fluorescence, to hot electron generation for photocatalysis.

ABSTRACT: We have grown ultrathin quartz plate-based multilayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). When employed as saturable absorber (SA), the prepared MoS2 device exhibits remarkable merits (e.g. uniform thickness, high quality of crystal lattice high damage threshold easy fabrication and good practicability). The modulation depth, saturable intensity, and non-saturable loss of this SA device are measured to be 16.1%, 0.438 MW/cm(2) and 44.6% respectively. By incorporating the SA into a typical ring cavity erbium-doped fiber laser, stable passive soliton mode-locked pulse is achieved with the repetition frequency of 0.987 MHz, the signal noise ratio (SNR) of 71.4 dB and the pulse duration of 2.17 ps. The experimental results demonstrate our MoS2-SA device to be an effective mode locker, and it is promising to be used in ultrafast photonics. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light represents an independent degree of freedom using orthogonal helical modes for optical and quantum multiplexing, offering great potential to transform future ultrahigh-bandwidth information systems. Practical OAM communication systems suffer from turbulence-induced phase distortions to the propagating beams, decreasing the orthogonality of OAM modes through introduced modal crosstalk. To date, optical systems used for measuring OAM orthogonality breakdown in different turbulence conditions are too bulky and slow (e.g., one OAM mode at a time) for any practical use. Here, we demonstrate the use of an ultrathin OAM mode-sorting metasurface for characterizing the OAM orthogonality breakdown under different turbulence conditions. Our approach allows the measurement of the whole OAM spectrum at the same time. This metasurface exhibits strong OAM selectivity with an average modal crosstalk below -42.4 dB for OAM modes with topological charges ranging from -15 to +15. Our results suggest that higher-order OAM modes are as robust as lower-order modes in particular turbulence environments, paving the way for future practical free-space OAM communications harnessing high-dimensional OAM multiplexing. We demonstrated that a flat optical device with a small form factor can be integrated with practical communication systems for compact, fast, and efficient generation and detection of twisted light.

While the dynamic motion control of the magnetic Skyrmions has been achieved through many techniques, studies on the manipulation of the photonic Skyrmion have rarely been done. Here, we show dynamic position control of photonic Skyrmion with the use of a phase profile imposed by a spatial light modulator. The photonic Skyrmions are generated by the spin-orbit coupling in the surface plasmon polariton field, and the spin textures are mapped through a nanoparticle-on-film configuration. The photonic Skyrmions are experimentally shown to be shifted flexibly in two dimensions, with precise position control and almost no distortion of the spin textures. In addition, the locking of the shifting directions to the Skyrmion chirality is observed when a liquid crystal plate is employed to provide the phase profile instead of the spatial light modulator. The proposed technique realizes the mapping of the spin angular momentum of the photonic Skyrmion with dynamic position control for the first time, which is expected to be valuable for future applications in optical information storage and transfer.

ABSTRACT: Anyons, particles displaying a fractional exchange statistics intermediate between bosons and fermions, play a central role in the fractional quantum Hall effect and various spin-lattice models, and have been proposed for topological quantum computing schemes due to their resilience to noise. Here we use parametric down-conversion in an integrated semiconductor chip to generate biphoton states simulating anyonic particle statistics in a reconfigurable manner. Our scheme exploits the frequency entanglement of the photon pairs, which is directly controlled through the spatial shaping of the pump beam. These results, demonstrated at room temperature and telecom wavelength on a chip-integrated platform, pave the way to the practical implementation of quantum simulation tasks with tailored particle statistics.

ABSTRACT: The far-field pattern of a simple one-dimensional laser array of emitters radiating into free space is considered. In the course of investigating the inverse problem for their near fields leading to a target beam form, surprisingly, we found that the result is successful when the matrix of the corresponding linear system is not well scaled. The essence of our numerical observations is captured by an elegant inequality defining the functional range of the optical distance between two neighboring emitters. Our finding can restrict substantially the parametric space of integrated photonic systems and simplify significantly the subsequent optimizations.

ABSTRACT: We report a novel hybrid refractive-diffractive microlens combined with spiral phase for the generation of optical vortex, which is fabricated via femtosecond laser direct writing technology. The unique optical performance of focusing capability is demonstrated. At the focus position, the hollow focus with different integer topological charges is investigated. Moreover, experimental results are supported by finite-element calculation. The novel microlens generating an optical vortex will fulfill important applications in optical manipulation, multistate information encoding, quantum communication, and computation, particularly in the compaction, integration, and simplification of optical vortex generation system.

ABSTRACT: Recent studies of the optical properties of 2D materials have reported unique phenomena and features that are absent in conventional bulk semiconductors. Many of these interesting properties, such as enhanced light-matter coupling, gate-tunable photoluminescence, and unusual excitonic optical selection rules arise from the nature of the two- and multi-particle excited states such as strongly bound Wannier excitons and charged excitons. The theory, modeling, and ab initio calculations of these optically excited states in 2D materials are reviewed. Several analytical and ab initio approaches are introduced. These methods are compared with each other, revealing their relative strength and limitations. Recent works that apply these methods to a variety of 2D materials and material-defect systems are then highlighted. Understanding of the optically excited states in these systems is relevant not only for fundamental scientific research of electronic excitations and correlations, but also plays an important role in the future development of quantum information science and nano-photonics.

ABSTRACT: Aiming at asymmetric Bessel mode, we investigate the propagation characteristics of vortex mode in atmospheric turbulence. The theoretical expressions of mode detection probability are derived for signal and crosstalk modes, based on which channel capacity is further analyzed. The detection probability distribution is mainly affected by mode wavelength and asymmetric factor. The increment of asymmetric factor can diversify the transverse mode intensity pattern, but cause the decline of signal probability and channel capacity. To improve channel capacity, longer wavelength and more transmitted modes are beneficial, while the adjustments of mode topological charge and Bessel cone angle have no effect. Besides, the influences of atmospheric turbulence conditions are discussed. The results are referential for exploring the use of asymmetric Bessel mode as signal source.

ABSTRACT: We demonstrate that the asymmetry of a high-power laser diode spectrum with its typical blue tail is related to frequency-dependent diffraction losses. A two-dimensional differential near-field analysis shows that the red longitudinal modes exhibit more self-focusing than the blue ones, reducing their diffraction losses, leading to as much as 20% variation of measured filament sizes in the plane parallel to the junction. The topological analysis of the far-field allows us to isolate the higher losses experienced by the blue modes, in agreement with a wavelength-dependent Kerr-lens model.

ABSTRACT: Analytical expressions for the cross-spectral density matrix of a partially coherent twisted Laguerre-Gaussian pulsed (PCTLGP) beam in anisotropic atmospheric turbulence are derived based on the extended Huygens-Fresnel principle. Numerical results indicate that the atmospheric turbulence induces the degeneration of the spectral intensity distribution of the PCTLGP beam, and the PCTLGP beam also shows different evolution properties on propagation in weaker turbulence and stronger turbulence. The PCTLGP beam with a negative twisted factor exhibits an advantage over the Laguerre-Gaussian pulsed beam for reducing the atmospheric turbulence-induced degeneration, and this advantage is further strengthened with increasing the topological charge, mode order and absolute value of the twisted factor. In addition, we also find that the pulse duration will affect the spectral intensity of the PCTLGP beam in turbulence. This kind of beam will show potential application value in free-space optical communications and remote sensing.

ABSTRACT: With the recent development of the metasurface, generating an optical vortex in optical far or near fields is realized in various ways. However, to generate vortices in both the near and far fields simultaneously is still a challenge, although it has great potential in the future compact and versatile photonic system. Here, a bi-channel optical vortex generator in both the near and far fields is proposed and demonstrated within a single metasurface, where the surface plasmon vortex and the far-field optical vortex can be simultaneously generated under circularly polarized light. The ability of generating vortices with arbitrary topological charges is experimentally demonstrated, which agrees well with simulations. This approach provides great freedom to integrate different vortex generators in a single device and offers new opportunities for integrated optical communications, trapping, and other related fields.

ABSTRACT: Optical modulation technique plays a crucial role in photonics technologies, and there is an ever-increasing demand for broadband and ultrafast optical modulation in the era of artificial intelligence. All-optical modulation is known to be able to operate in an ultrafast way and has a broadband response, showing great potential in applications for ultrafast information processing and photonic computing. Two-dimensional (2D) materials with exotic optoelectronic properties bring tremendous new opportunities for all-optical modulators with excellent performance, which have attracted lots of attention recently. In this review, we cover the state-of-art all-optical modulation based on 2D materials, including graphene, transitional metal dichalcogenides, phosphorus, and other novel 2D materials. We present the operations mechanism of different types of all-optical modulators with various configurations, such as fiber-integrated and free-space ones. We also discuss the challenges and opportunities faced by all-optical modulation, as well as offer some future perspectives for the development of all-optical modulation based on 2D materials.

ABSTRACT: Remote sensing of the Earth allows to receive medium information, a high spatial resolution from space vehicles, and to conduct hyperspectral measurements. This study presents a remote sensing application using time-series Landsat satellite images to monitor the solid waste disposal site (WDS). The article proposes algorithms for working with spatial information, namely the transformation (convolution) of these manifolds into a one-dimensional sample. Recursive quasi-continuous sweeps are used for which the following conditions are satisfied: 1) preservation of the topological proximity of the original and expanded spaces, 2) preservation of correlations between the elements of the original and transformed spaces. An automated system is proposed for detecting and investigating waste objects based on the concept of fractal sets and convolutional neural networks. The first neural network detects WDS, the second works to localize the waste objects. This technique can become the object of further research on developing a medical-prophylactic expert system at the territorial level to detect and neutralize unauthorized waste disposal sites based on medium and high-resolution space images. As a result, the proposed method demonstrates good accuracy in detecting the solid waste disposal site on real satellite images.

ABSTRACT: We present two kinds of interferences on metallic thin films with orbital angular momentum (OAM) beams, namely, double-slit interference and square-slit interference. When an OAM beam is normally incident upon the metallic thin film with two slits, the fringes on the metallic thin film generated by the interference of two surface-plasmonpolariton waves will twist, and the twist amount depends on the topological charge of the incoming OAM beam. When a square slit is employed, a quasi-square optical lattice will be unveiled, and the arrangement of lattice can be modulated by the OAM beam. The fringes and spots are both at the subwavelength level, which show great potential for superresolution microscopy, OAM detection, and spot-array generation.

ABSTRACT: Achieving tunable physical properties is currently one of the most exciting research topics. In order to realize this goal, a medium that is responsive to external stimuli and can undergo a change in its physical property is required. Liquid crystal (LC) is a prominent candidate, as its physical and optical properties can be easily manipulated with various stimuli, such as surface anchoring, rubbing, geometric confinement, and external fields. Having broken away from the past devotion to obtaining a uniform domain of LCs, people are now putting significant efforts toward forming and manipulating ordered and oriented defect structures with a unique arrangement within. The complicated molecular order with tunability would benefit the interdisciplinary research fields of optics, physics, photonics, and materials science. In this review, the recent progress toward defect engineering in the nematic and smectic phases by controlling the surface environment and electric field and their combinational methods is introduced. We close the review with a discussion of the possible applications enabled using LC defect structures as switchable materials.

ABSTRACT: The cylindrical vector beams (CVBs) compose two circularly polarized vortex beams carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) states with the opposite topological charge. We derived the probabilities for OAM of high-order CVB propagation through turbulent atmosphere. The calculated probabilities of OAM are based on the polarization insensitive element detection and phase perturbation coherence function assumption. The numerical calculation results show that the probabilities of OAM state spreading to neighbor states of CVBs through turbulent atmosphere increase with the propagation distance increase. Under the same conditions, the spreading of OAM for CVBs are weaker than Laguerre-Gaussian beam propagation through turbulent atmosphere. The results show that the OAM state of CVBs could improve the performance of optical communications systems in atmospheric turbulence.

ABSTRACT: Quantum walks are processes that model dynamics in coherent systems. Their experimental implementations proved to be key to unveiling novel phenomena in Floquet topological insulators. Here, we realize a photonic quantum walk in the presence of a synthetic gauge field, which mimics the action of an electric field on a charged particle. By tuning the energy gaps between the two quasi-energy bands, we investigate intriguing system dynamics characterized by the interplay between Bloch oscillations and Landau-Zener transitions. When both gaps at quasi-energy values of 0 and pi are vanishingly small, the Floquet dynamics follows a ballistic spreading.

ABSTRACT: Vector vortex beams have attracted considerable research attention owing to their unique optical properties, and have been explored in vortex filtering, photon entanglement, and the photonic spin hall effect. In this work, a universal all-dielectric metasurface platform is proposed that can generate longitudinally varying vector vortex beams in the terahertz band. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, a series of metasurface examples generating evolution of topological charges and vector polarization states of generated vector vortex beams are characterized. The experimental results agree well with the simulations, fully verifying the feasibility of the proposed scheme. The proposed metasurface strategy may find applications ranging from optical traps to polarization optics.

ABSTRACT: Using Jones matrices and vectors, we show that a metasurface-based optical element composed of a set of subwavelength diffraction gratings, whose anisotropic transmittance is described by a matrix of polarization rotation by angle m phi, where phi is the polar angle, generate an nth order azimuthally or radially polarized beam, when illuminated by linearly polarized light, or an optical vortex with topological charge m, when illuminated by circularly polarized light. Such a converter performs a spin-orbit transformation, acting similarly to a liquid-crystal half-wave plate. Using the FDTD-aided numerical simulation, we show that uniform linearly or circularly polarized light passing through the above-described optical metasurface with m = 2 and then tightly focused with a binary zone plate generates an on-axis near-focus energy backflow comparable in magnitude with the incident energy. Notably, the magnitude of the reverse energy flow is shown to be the same when focusing a circularly polarized optical vortex with topological charge m = 2 and a light beam with the second-order polarization singularity.

ABSTRACT: Using the Richards-Wolf formalism, we show that if an optical vortex with a topological charge of 3 and with left (opposite) circular polarization is sharply focused by an aplanatic system, then in the focal plane there is a reversed flux of light energy near the optical axis (on the axis itself it is zero), which is only 2-3 times less than the forward energy flux in the focus. It is also shown that near the optical axis the reverse flux propagates along a counterclockwise helix (spiral) around the optical axis. The reverse flux near the optical axis is also demonstrated by the FDTD-simulation of diffraction of a circularly polarized plane wave by a third-order spiral zone plate with a numerical aperture of about 1. A Rayleigh microparticle trapped in the area of such a focus should move in the opposite direction with respect to the direction of beam propagation.

ABSTRACT: The analytical solution for the propagation of the laser beam with optical vortex through the system of lenses is presented. The optical vortex is introduced into the laser beam (described as Gaussian beam) by spiral phase plate. The solution is general as it holds for the optical vortex of any integer topological charge, the off-axis position of the spiral phase plate and any number of lenses. Some intriguing conclusions are discussed. The higher order vortices are unstable and split under small phase or amplitude disturbance. Nevertheless, we have shown that off-axis higher order vortices are stable during the propagation through the set of lenses described in paraxial approximation, which is untypical behavior. The vortex trajectory registered at image plane due to spiral phase plate shift behaves like a rigid body. We have introduced a new factor which in our beam plays the same role as Gouy phase in pure Gaussian beam.

ABSTRACT: We show that when strongly focusing a linearly polarized optical vortex with the topological charge 2 (or -2) in the near-focus region, there occurs not only a reverse energy flow (where the projection of the Poynting vector is negative) but the right- (or left-) handed circular polarization of light as well. Notably, thanks to spin-orbital conversion, the on-axis polarization vector handedness is the same as that of the transverse energy flow, i.e., anticlockwise (clockwise). An absorbing spherical microparticle centered on the optical axis placed in the focus may be expected to rotate anticlockwise (clockwise) around its axis and its center of masses. We also show that in the case of sharp focusing of light with linear polarization (without an optical vortex) before and after focus, the light has an even number of local regions with left- and right-handed circular (elliptical) polarizations. Theoretical predictions are corroborated by the numerical simulation.

ABSTRACT: Topological structure of the mathematical models of the laser diode amplifier (LDA) can be visualized with the help of a diagrammatic method based on depicting differential relationships of the form delta y = t(xy)delta x by the diagram x --> y. The quantity t(xy) is called the transmission function of the oriented line xy. Such atomic diagrams can be combined to more involved schemes to represent systems of mathematic formulas. The approach is demonstrated on the LDA model proposed by Adams. The diagram representing this model is derived and shown to contain two closed oriented paths - feedback loops. The transmission functions of these loops are shown to have a controlling influence on the qualitative operation mode of the LDA. In particular, if their sum crosses the unity level in two distinct states, the LDA acts as a bistable element. This condition can be expressed in terms of the numeric values of the characteristic parameters such as the driving electric current, facet reflectivities, resonator length, etc.

ABSTRACT: Synchronization is of importance in both fundamental and applied physics, but its demonstration at the micro/nanoscale is mainly limited to low-frequency oscillations such as mechanical resonators. We report the synchronization of two coupled optical microresonators, in which the high-frequency resonances in the optical domain are aligned with reduced noise. It is found that two types of synchronization regimes emerge with either the first- or second-order transition, both presenting a process of spontaneous symmetry breaking. In the second-order regime, the synchronization happens with an invariant topological character number and a larger detuning than that of the first-order case. Furthermore, an unconventional hysteresis behavior is revealed for a time-dependent coupling strength, breaking the static limitation and the temporal reciprocity. The synchronization of optical microresonators offers great potential in reconfigurable simulations of manybody physics and scalable photonic devices on a chip.

ABSTRACT: Optical interactions are governed by both spin and angular momentum conservation laws, which serve as a tool for controlling light-matter interactions or elucidating electron dynamics and structure of complex systems. Here, we uncover a form of simultaneous spin and orbital angular momentum conservation and show, theoretically and experimentally, that this phenomenon allows for unprecedented control over the divergence and polarization of extreme-ultraviolet vortex beams. High harmonics with spin and orbital angular momenta are produced, opening a novel regime of angular momentum conservation that allows for manipulation of the polarization of attosecond pulses-from linear to circular-and for the generation of circularly polarized vortices with tailored orbital angular momentum, including harmonic vortices with the same topological charge as the driving laser beam. Our work paves the way to ultrafast studies of chiral systems using high-harmonic beams with designer spin and orbital angular momentum.

ABSTRACT: Synthetic dimensions provide a promising platform for photonic quantum simulations. Manipulating the flow of photons in these dimensions requires an electric field. However, photons do not have charge and do not directly interact with electric fields. Therefore, alternative approaches are needed to realize electric fields in photonics. One approach is to use engineered gauge fields that can mimic the effect of electric fields and produce the same dynamical behavior. Here, we demonstrate such an electric field for photons propagating in a two-dimensional synthetic space. Generation of electric fields in a two-dimensional synthetic lattice provides the possibility to guide photons and to trap them through the creation of quantum confined structures. We achieve this using a linearly time-varying gauge field generated by direction-dependent phase modulations. We show that the generated electric field leads to Bloch oscillations and the revival of the state after a certain number of steps dependent on the field strength. We measure the probability of the revival and demonstrate a good agreement between the observed values and the theoretically predicted results. Furthermore, by applying a nonuniform electric field, we show the possibility of waveguiding photons. Ultimately, our results open up new opportunities for manipulating the propagation of photons with potential applications in photonic quantum simulations.

ABSTRACT: Photonic integrated circuits have garnered significant attention in recent years. To enhance the functional versatility of these devices, researchers have introduced the concept of reconfiguration into photonic integrated circuits. Inspired by field programmable gate arrays in the electrical domain, programmable photonic chips employing various topologies have been developed. However, users still encounter challenges when utilizing these devices, as they need to understand the internal structure and principles of the chip and individually adjust the tunable basic units within the topology network. In this paper, we employ the quadrilateral topological network based on the on-chip Mach-Zehnder interferometer as a black box to realize a highly self-reconfigurable optical signal processor. By leveraging this approach, we achieve positive real-valued matrix computation, optical routing, and low-loss optical energy splitting. Our demonstration effectively showcases the immense potential of on-chip programmable photonic waveguide meshes.

ABSTRACT: Quantum fluids of light are an emerging platform for energy-efficient signal processing, ultrasensitive interferometry and quantum simulators at elevated temperatures. Here we demonstrate all-optical control of the topological excitations in a large polariton condensate realizing the bosonic analogue of a long Josephson junction and inducing the nucleation of Josephson vortices. When a phase difference is imposed at the boundaries of the condensate, two extended regions become separated by a sharp phase jump of pi radians and a solitonic depletion of the density, forming an insulating barrier with a suppressed order parameter. The superfluid behaviour-characterized by a smooth phase gradient across the system instead of the sharp phase jump-is recovered at higher polariton densities and is mediated by the nucleation of Josephson vortices within the barrier. Our results contribute to the understanding of dissipation and stability of elementary excitations in macroscale quantum systems.

ABSTRACT: We experimentally demonstrated a method of generating continuously wavelength-switchable optical vortex beams (OVBs) in an all-fiber laser. A polarization-dependent microknot resonator (MKR) functions as comb filter and accounts for the narrow linewidth (0.018 nm) of multiwavelength channels. The wavelength interval corresponds to the free spectral range of the MKR. We exploit a fused SMF-FMF (single mode fiber-few mode fiber) mode coupler to obtain broadband mode conversion and successfully achieve multiwavelength switchable OVBs. As far as we know, this is the first report about identical multiwavelength vortex beams with topological charges of +/- 1. It has been verified that each channel of the vortex beams preserves the same orbital angular momentum (OAM) properties through their clear spiral interferograms. Multiwavelength vortex beams with identical OAM properties are desirable for multiplexing, exchanging, and routing to further improve the capacity of optical fiber transmission.

ABSTRACT: "The realization of pseudomagnetic fields for lightwaves has attained great attention in the field of nanophotonics. Like real magnetic fields, Landau quantization could be induced by pseudomagnetic fields in the strain engineered graphene. We demonstrated that pseudomagnetic fields can also be introduced to photonic crystals by exerting a linear parabolic deformation onto the honeycomb lattices, giving rise to degenerate energy states and flat plateaus in the photonic band structures. We successfully inspire the photonic snake modes corresponding to the helical state in the synthetic magnetic heterostructure by adopting a microdisk for the unidirectional coupling. By integrating heat electrodes, we can further electrically manipulate the photonic density of states for the uniaxially strained photonic crystal. This offers an unprecedented opportunity to obtain on-chip robust optical transports under the electrical tunable pseudomagnetic fields, opening the possibility to design Si-based functional topological photonic devices.& COPY  2023 Chinese Laser Press"

ABSTRACT: Recently studied bound states in the continuum (BICs) enable perfect localization of light and enhance light -matter interactions although systems are optically open. They have found applications in numerous areas, including optical nonlinearity, light emitters, and nano-sensors. However, their unidirectional nature in nonreciprocal devices is still elusive because such trapping states are easily destroyed when the symmetry of an optical system is broken. Herein, we propose nonreciprocal and dynamically tunable BICs for unidirectional confinement of light and symmetry-protected BICs at Gamma-point by introducing antiparallel magnetism into the optical system. We demonstrate that such BICs can be achieved by using topological magnetic Weyl semimetals near zero-index frequency without any structural asymmetry, and are largely tunable via modifying the Fermi level. Our results reveal a regime of extreme light manipulation and interaction with emerging quantum materials for various practical applications. (C) 2022 Chinese Laser Press

ABSTRACT: Singularities in the spectra of open systems, known as exceptional points (EPs), have been shown to exhibit non-trivial topological properties and enhanced sensitivities. Here, we propose a novel approach to realize the EPs in a plasmon-exciton hybrid system and explore their applications in enhanced nanoscale sensing technology. We consider a plasmon-exciton system composed of a gold nanorod and a monolayer WSe2. By controlling the geometric parameters of the nano-hybrid system, we obtain simultaneous coalescence of the resonance frequencies and loss rates of the hybrid system, which is a unique feature of EPs. Numerical simulations show its application in enhanced nanoscale sensing for environmental refractive indices. Our work opens the way to a new class of sensors based on EP-enhanced sensing, with intrinsic nanoscale sensitivity due to the sub-diffraction- limit size of the plasmon-exdton nano-hybrid system.

ABSTRACT: Traditionally, optical vortices (OVs) were generated with diffractive optical elements (DOEs) such as spiral phase plate (SPP), fork grating, spatial light modulator (SLM), and liquid crystal display (LCD). Here, a method was proposed for generating OVs by employing all-dielectric polarization-insensitive metasurfaces with cylinder arrays, which have high transmission efficiency. The polarization insensitivity of the metasurfaces was illustrated with the incidence of two pairs of orthogonal polarization, both the phase and transmission efficiency were consistent for the cylinder unit cell, and similar OVs were generated with the cylinder array. The topological charges of the generated OVs can be adjusted through the design of the metasurfaces. OVs with additional characteristics as vector beams, focused beams and Bessel beams were further generated. This work has potential applications in beam shaping, optical tweezers, and optical communication.

ABSTRACT: We propose a design on integrated optical devices on-chip with an extra width degree of freedom by using a photonic crystal waveguide with Dirac points between two photonic crystals with opposite valley Chern numbers. With such an extra waveguide, we demonstrate numerically that the topologically protected photonic waveguide retains properties of valley-locking and immunity to defects. Due to the design flexibility of the width-tunable topologically protected photonic waveguide, many unique on-chip integrated devices have been proposed, such as energy concentrators with a concentration efficiency improvement of more than one order of magnitude, and a topological photonic power splitter with an arbitrary power splitting ratio. The topologically protected photonic waveguide with the width degree of freedom could be beneficial for scaling up photonic devices, and provides a flexible platform to implement integrated photonic networks on-chip.

ABSTRACT: A chiral arrangement of molecular nanoemitters is shown to support delocalised exciton states whose spontaneous decay can generate optical vortex radiation. In contrast to techniques in which phase modification is imposed upon conventional optical beams, this exciton method enables radiation with a helical wave-front to be produced directly. To achieve this end, a number of important polarisation and symmetry-based criteria need to be satisfied. It emerges that the phase structure of the optical field produced by degenerate excitons in a propeller-shaped array can exhibit precisely the sought character of an optical vortex - one with unit topological charge. Practical considerations for the further development of this technique are discussed, and potential new applications are identified.

ABSTRACT: In order to realize unidirectional surface plasmon polariton coupling, here, we design an orbital angular momentum-controlled tunable directional plasmonic coupler which can distinguish optical vortex with a topological charge of +/- 1 precisely, as well as act as surface plasmon polariton propagation controller to determine the surface plasmon polariton coupling directions. The method of design for the directional plasmonic coupler is explained in detail by both the theoretical analysis and the numerical simulation showing a directionality of similar to 5:1. It is believed the directional plasmonic coupler can potentially be applied in the plasmonic control system.

ABSTRACT: Level set methods provide powerful numerical techniques for analyzing and solving interface evolution problems based on partial differential equations. Level sets display interesting elastic behaviors and can handle topological changes. Although level set methods have many advantages, they still often face difficult challenges such as poor image contrast, noise, and missing or diffuse boundaries. The robust level set method of this paper is based on the anisotropic diffusion method. The fast marching method provides a fast implementation for level set methods, the anisotropic diffusion is allowed to better control the amount of smoothing effect and this process can get both noise smoothing and edge enhancement at the same time. Experimental results indicate that the method can greatly reduce the noise without distorting the image and made the level set methods more robust and accurate.

ABSTRACT: development of THz devises. A number of material systems have been proposed and demonstrated for THz plasmonic resonators, including doped semiconductors, materials with metallic behavior, such as graphene, graphite, and carbon nano-tubes, superconductors and topological insulators. However, experimental investigations of THz plasmonic resonators, which are typically a fraction of the free space wavelength in size, remain challenging. We demonstrate that THz near-field spectroscopy and imaging technique based on a sub-wavelength aperture probe can be employed to detect excitation of THz plasmons in carbon micro-fibers. Upon excitation of a single carbon fiber by a THz pulse, we observe a standing wave formed along the fiber length. The resonant frequency is consistent with the fundamental dipole mode, both in its value and in its dependence on the fiber length. The field of the standing wave is localized and it indicates the plasmonic nature of the excitation. The fact that the resonance frequency also depends on the material conductivity allows us to employ the THz near-field spectroscopy method to evaluate the material conductivity non-invasively. Furthermore we propose an alternative method for non-contact conductivity probing. It utilizes the relative amplitude of the surface plasmon field that can be measured by the near-field probe. The amplitude increases with the fiber conductivity and therefore it can be used for conductivity estimation.

ABSTRACT: Bismuth oxysulfide (Bi2O2S) is a layered material with high carrier mobility, excellent light absorption characteristic and good stability. However, there are few reports about the use of Bi2O2S in photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. In this paper, Bi2O2S nanosheets (NSs) films were prepared on FTO substrates by one-step hydrothermal method, which broke the traditional powder state of Bi2O2S prepared. Based on the high lattice matching between antimony sulfide (Sb2S3) and bismuth sulfide (Bi2S3) obtained from the topological trans-formation of partial Bi2O2S, Sb2S3 nanorods (NRs) with [hk1] predominant orientation were epitaxially grown on the surface of Bi2O2S to establish a transport channel for rapid carrier migration. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) electron transport layer with oxygen vacancies was introduced into the back to capture and release electrons, further reducing the recombination rate. The photocurrent density of TiO2/Bi2O2S/Sb2S3-annealed photo -electrode at 1.23 V vs. RHE was 4.37 mA/cm2, which was 13.7 times that of monomer Bi2O2S. In addition, the TiO2/Bi2O2S/Sb2S3-annealed photoelectrode had lower charge transfer resistance and the IPCE value up to 48.22%. This study is of great significance for the application of Bi2O2S based photoelectrodes in the field of PEC water splitting.

ABSTRACT: The effects of asymmetry atmospheric eddies on the beam spreading and wander of Bessel-Gaussian (BG) beams in anisotropic turbulence are studied. Results show that turbulence anisotropy leads to the declines in both beam spreading and wander of BG beams in the atmosphere. A BG beam with larger beam shape parameter. has a narrower spot size in a short-distance range and a wider spot size in a long-distance range. The effective Rayleigh ranges of BG beams for every turbulent situation decrease with the beam shape parameter.. When. is larger than 10, atmospheric turbulence has a negligible effect on effective Rayleigh range. The effective Rayleigh range and beam spreading increase and beam wander decreases as topological charge increase. Beam spreading is mainly affected by turbulence inner-scale, and outer-scale evidently affects beam wander in the atmosphere.

ABSTRACT: We proposed an optical vortex array (OVA) with deformable hybrid Ferris structures (DH-OVA). The DH-OVA was generated via the coaxial coherent superposition of two grafted elliptic perfect optical vortices (OVs) with different topological charges (TCs). The proposed DH-OVA exhibited the capacity of a free transformation from a circle to an ellipse except for the modulation of the number and sign of the unit OVs on the array. The OV distribution obeys the rule of uniform distribution of the area on the upper or lower half. By adjusting the initial phase difference, the orientation factor, and the direction of the grafted axis, a more complex OV motion and the entire hybrid rotation of the DH-OVA can be easily conducted according to the desired application. For instance, for the unidirectional and bidirectional motions of the OVs, regardless of whether they possessed the same or opposite signs, the entire rotation contained the unit OV's motion. During the OV's motion, the number of dark cores was not conserved, whereas the total TCs of the OVs were conserved on the DH-OVA. Results contrasted with the conventional wisdom on OVAs. Furthermore, the bidirectional motion of yeast particles via the DH-OVA was executed experimentally. This work provided a flexible DH-OVA, which will result in new potential applications in particle transfer, polarity particle sorting, and micro-particle manipulation.

ABSTRACT: Orbital angular momentum (OAM) multiplexing provides an efficient method to improve data-carrying capacity in various quantum communication protocols. It is a precondition to distribute OAM multiplexed quantum resources in quantum channels for implementing quantum communication. However, quantum steering of OAM multiplexed optical fields and the effect of channel noise on OAM multiplexed quantum resources remain unclear. Here, we generate OAM multiplexed continuous-variable (CV) entangled states and distribute them in lossy or noisy channels. We show that the decoherence property of entanglement and quantum steering of the OAM multiplexed states carrying topological charges l = 1 and l = 2 are the same as that of the Gaussian mode with l = 0 in lossy and noisy channels. The sudden death of entanglement and quantum steering of high-order OAM multiplexed states is observed in the presence of excess noise. Our results demonstrate the feasibility to realize high data-carrying capacity quantum information processing by utilizing OAM multiplexed CV entangled states. (C) 2022 Chinese Laser Press

ABSTRACT: Recently, the perfect vector (PV) beam has sparked considerable interest because its radius is independent of the topological charge (TC), which has demonstrated special capabilities in optical manipulation, microscopy imaging, and laser micromachining. Previous research about the generation and manipulation of such PV beams only focuses on the linear optical fields. Therefore, the generation of nonlinear PV beams is still lacking. Here, we propose a dual waveband generator to simultaneously generate the PV beams in linear and nonlinear wavebands. In our experiment, PV beams with different polarization states are realized. It is proved that the polarization states of the generated PV beams can be flexibly adjusted by changing the axis direction of a half wave plate. The experimental results show that the radii of the generated PV beams are equal and independent of the TCs. With proper alteration of the nonlinear crystals, this approach could be further extended to other nonlinear processes, such as sum-frequency generation and difference-frequency generation.

ABSTRACT: In recent years many technological applications based on graphene-structured systems have attracted great interest of the solid state community due to the non-peculiar optical properties of graphene related to the strong movility of the charge carriers of this material. One of these applications is the electro-optical modulator, which becomes a key device for optical communication. In this connection, in this paper we theoretically propose an electro-optical system based on a graphene-structured Schottky junction and gated by a low voltage, which induces a considerably transmission modulation of the terahertz signal. One of the most important results of the presented system, that is supported on the strong interaction between Dirac electrons and circularly polarized photons of the field radiation, lies especially in that no extra pumping optical field is needed to obtain a modulation depth around 97% for a low gate voltage of 0.42 V. For positive voltages, the signal amplitude strongly increases till the built-in potential value is reached. For voltage values over the built-in potential a reversing tendency of the modulation depth is observed, whereas for negative values of the voltage the modulation decreases, presenting the system a classical Schottky diode behavior. We also report an oscillatory behavior of the signal amplitude that, in addition to the known Drude behavior, complements the description of the terahertz transmission spectra. In this context, we develop a quantum formulation, which is able to describe clearly these nonlinear effects on the basis of the coherent and incoherent momentum relaxation of photon dressed electrons at impurities in such graphene-structured systems.

ABSTRACT: Light-induced supercurrents chart a path forward for the electromagnetic design of emergent materials phases and collective modes for quantum engineering applications. However, controlled spatial-temporal modulation of the complex order parameter characterizing such non-equilibrium macroscopic quantum states remains elusive. Such ultrafast phase-amplitude modulation can manifest via high harmonic modes beyond those allowed by equilibrium symmetries. Here, we drive moving condensate states via subcycle dynamical symmetry breaking achieved with nonlinear oscillating terahertz photocurrents. These non-equilibrium macroscopic quantum states with broken inversion symmetry are controlled via Cooper pair acceleration by asymmetric and multi-cycle terahertz photoexcitations. The observed supercurrent-carrying states evolve during a lightwave cycle and exhibit three distinguishing features: Anderson pseudo-spin precessions forbidden by equilibrium symmetry, strong high harmonic coherent oscillations assisted by pairing and long-lived gapless superfluidity with minimal condensate quench. Lightwave tuning of persistent photocurrents can be extended for quantum control of unconventional superconductors and topological matter, with implications on quantum gate and sensing functionalities.

ABSTRACT: The creation of increasingly large multipartite entangled states is not only a fundamental scientific endeavour in itself(1-3), but is also the enabling technology for quantum information(4,5). Tremendous experimental effort has been devoted to generating multiparticle entanglement with a growing number of qubits(6-16). So far, up to six spatially separated single photons(10-14) have been entangled based on parametric downconversion(17). Multiple degrees of freedom of a single photon have been exploited to generate forms of hyper-entangled states(18,19). Here, using new ultra-bright sources of entangled photon pairs(20), an eight-photon interferometer and post-selection detection, we demonstrate for the first time the creation of an eight-photon Schrodinger cat state(1) with genuine multipartite entanglement. The ability to control eight individual photons represents a step towards optical quantum computation, and will enable new experiments on, for example, quantum simulation(21,22), topological error correction(23) and testing entanglement dynamics under decoherence(24).

ABSTRACT: "Parity-time (PT) symmetric lattices have been widely studied in controlling the flow of waves, and recently, moire superlattices, connecting the periodic and non-periodic potentials, have been introduced for exploring unconventional physical properties in physics, while the combination of both and nonlinear waves therein remains unclear. Here, we report a theoretical survey of nonlinear wave localizations in PT symmetric moire optical lattices, with the aim of revealing localized gap modes of different types and their stabilization mechanism. We uncover the formation, properties, and dynamics of fundamental and higher-order gap solitons as well as vortical ones with topological charge, all residing in the finite bandgaps of the underlying linear-Bloch wave spectrum. The stability regions of localized gap modes are inspected in two numerical ways: linear-stability analysis and direct perturbance simulations. Our results provide an insightful understanding of soliton physics in combined versatile platforms of PT symmetric systems and moire patterns. & COPY  2023 Chinese Laser Press"

ABSTRACT: Highly customized and miniaturized structured light is expected in many application fields. A kind of structured vortex generators is proposed based on a metasurface consisting of rectangular nanoholes etched in a silver film, and the generated vortices with the same or different topological charges are distributed along the radial direction. The geometric metasurface is completed with the help of optical holography technology, and the structured vortex generator possesses high working efficiency and large information capacity. The proposed vortex generators work under circularly polarized light illumination, and the reproduced vortices of multiplexing vortex generator depend on the handedness of the circularly polarized light. This work paves a way to generate new structured light fields. The radially distributed vortices may be utilized to simultaneously screen or separate microparticles. The compact design of the structured vortex generator and the convenient switch of different structured vortices will be a benefit to expand the applications of structured vortex fields.

ABSTRACT: A history and a glimpse into the future of spaser (acronym for surface plasmon amplification by stimulated emission of radiation) is provided. The spaser (also called a plasmonic nanolaser) is an active nanosystem including a gain medium and a nanoplasmonic metal core. It generates coherent intense nanolocalized fields. Theoretically predicted in 2003 by Bergman and Stockman, the spaser grew into a large fundamental research and application field with thousands of publications. We review a few of them to illustrate the most important and general fundamental properties of the spaser. We also review some selected applications of spasers, in particular, to ultrasensing and biomedical problems, concentrating on cancer-cell theranostics (therapeutics and diagnostics). In conclusion, we attempt to glimpse into the future by predicting that the next big development of the spasers will be topological nano-optics, and its killer application will be ultrafast, high-density on-chip communications for future information processing.

ABSTRACT: We have recently shown that spiral phase plates (SPPs) with continuous surface can be fabricated with one time exposing process only [35]. Four categories of SPPs with different topological charges at wavelength of 532 nm were prepared, and the corresponding vortex beams were obtained. In this paper, in order to verify the optical effects' quality of the SPPs, the optical characteristics, including the diffractive and interferential characteristics, were systematically analyzed in the Fresnel diffraction region. In addition, the optical characteristics have been used to describe the surface profile of the SPPs. The results show that the SPPs have good surface quality and excellent optical effects. Compared with the other generation methods for vortex beam, this method is particularly suitable for obtaining a vortex beam with high efficiency and continuous phase and is extremely promoting R&D of the corresponding applications.

ABSTRACT: Non-perturbative coupling of photons and excitons produces hybrid particles, exciton-polaritons, which have exhibited a variety of many-body phenomena in various microcavity systems. However, the vacuum Rabi splitting (VRS), which defines the strength of photon-exciton coupling, is usually a single constant for a given system. Here, we have developed a unique architecture in which excitons in an aligned single-chirality carbon nanotube film interact with cavity photons in polarization-dependent manners. The system reveals ultrastrong coupling (VRS up to 329 meV or a coupling-strength-to-transition-energy ratio of 13.3%) for polarization parallel to the nanotube axis, whereas VRS is absent for perpendicular polarization. Between these two extremes, VRS is continuously tunable through polarization rotation with exceptional points separating crossing and anti-crossing. The points between exceptional points form equienergy arcs onto which the upper and lower polaritons coalesce. The demonstrated on-demand ultrastrong coupling provides ways to explore topological properties of polaritons and quantum technology applications.

ABSTRACT: The recently established paradigm of higher-order topological states of matter has shown that not only edge and surface states(1,2) but also states localized to corners, can have robust and exotic properties(3-9). Here we report on the experimental realization of novel corner states made out of visible light in three-dimensional photonic structures inscribed in glass samples using femtosecond laser technology(10,11). By creating and analysing waveguide arrays, which form two-dimensional breathing kagome lattices in various sample geometries, we establish this as a platform for corner states exhibiting a remarkable degree of flexibility and control. In each sample geometry we measure eigenmodes that are localized at the corners in a finite frequency range, in complete analogy with a theoretical model of the breathing kagome(7-9,12-14). Here, measurements reveal that light can be 'fractionalized,' corresponding to simultaneous localization to each corner of a triangular sample, even in the presence of defects.

ABSTRACT: Assuming weakly guiding approximation, we examine orbital angular momentum (OAM) mode mixing on account of ellipticity in a fiber and derive a complete set of analytic expressions for spatial crosstalk, using scalar perturbation theory that incorporates fully the existing degeneracy between a spatial OAM mode and its degenerate partner characterized by a topological charge of opposite sign. These expressions, consequently, include an explicit formula for calculating the $2\pi$ walk-off length over which an input OAM mode converts into its degenerate partner, and back into itself. We further explore the applicability of the derived expressions in the presence of spin-orbit interaction. The expressions constitute a useful mathematical tool in the analysis and design of fibers for spatially-multiplexed mode transmissions. Their utility is demonstrated with application to a few mode and a multimode step-index fiber.

ABSTRACT: A spin current has novel linear and second-order nonlinear optical effects due to its symmetry properties. With the symmetry analysis and the eight-band microscopic calculation we have systematically investigated the interaction between a spin current and a polarized light beam (or the photon spin current) in direct-gap semiconductors. This interaction is rooted in the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling in valence bands and does not rely on the Rashba or Dresselhaus effect. The light-spin current interaction results in an optical birefringence effect of the spin current. The symmetry analysis indicates that in a semiconductor with inversion symmetry, the linear birefringence effect vanishes and only the circular birefringence effect exists. The circular birefringence effect is similar to the Faraday rotation in magneto-optics but involves neither net magnetization nor breaking the time-reversal symmetry. Moreover, a spin current can induce the second-order nonlinear optical processes due to the inversion-symmetry breaking. These findings form a basis of measuring a pure spin current where and when it flows with the standard optical spectroscopy, which may provide a toolbox to explore a wealth of physics connecting the spintronics and photonics.

ABSTRACT: We investigate the evolution properties of a partially coherent Laguerre-Gaussian vector vortex (LGVV) beam through inhomogeneous atmospheric turbulence. Analytical formulae for the elements of a cross-spectral density matrix of a partially coherent LGVV beam propagating in turbulence are derived with the help of the extended Huygens-Fresnel principle. Our outcomes demonstrate that the normalized initial profile of a partially coherent beam with concentric dark rings gradually evolves into a Gaussian-like beam profile in turbulence. We also find that the beam is emitted at a large zenith angle and quickly converts to a Gaussian-like beam. Furthermore, it is also shown that a propagation beam with a large topological charge has a stronger ability to resist atmospheric turbulence. In order to confirm our numerical results, we combine the complex screen method and multi-phase screen method to simulate the propagation of a partially coherent LGVV beam in atmospheric turbulence. It is indicated that the simulation results are in good agreement with theoretical predictions. Our results will pave the way for the development of free-space optical communications and remote sensing.

ABSTRACT: Using the two-dimensional nonlinear Schrodinger equation, the collapse dynamics of vortex beams in a Kerr medium with refractive index modulation and parity-time (PT) symmetric lattices are explored. The critical power for the collapse of vortex beams in a Kerr medium with real optical lattices (i.e., refractive index modulation lattices) was obtained and discussed. Numerical calculations showed that the number of self-focusing points, the locations of the collapse, and the propagation distances for collapse are sensitively dependent on the modulation factors, topological charge numbers, and initial powers. When the vortex optical field propagates in a Kerr medium with real optical lattices, the optical field will collapse into a symmetrical shape. However, the shape of the vortex beam will be chaotically distorted and collapse in asymmetric patterns during propagation in a Kerr medium with PT-symmetric lattices because of the presence of the complex refraction index. Introducing PT-symmetric lattices into nonlinear Kerr materials may offer a new approach to controlling the collapse of vortex beams.

ABSTRACT: As a promising platform for versatile electromagnetic (EM) manipulations, metasurfaces have drawn wide interest in recent years due to their unique EM properties and small footprints. However, although great efforts have been made to achieve multifunctionalities, the design of tunable metasurfaces with high compactness is still challenging. Here, a simple yet powerful design methodology for single-layered reconfigurable metasurfaces composed of nonvolatile phase-change material Ge2Sb2Se4Te1 (GSST) is proposed with average working amplitudes of 72.6% and 53% at different crystallization levels. The proposed metasurfaces could not only enable independent phase control at different crystallization levels but also introduced another polarization degree of freedom. As a proof of concept, we numerically demonstrate three kinds of metadevices in the infrared region achieving a multi-focus metalens with tunable foci, multistate vortex beam generator with adjustable topological charges and multi-channel meta-hologram with three independent information channels. It is believed that these multifunctional metasurfaces with both tunability and compactness are promising for various applications including information encryption, chiroptical spectroscopy, chiral imaging and wireless communication.

ABSTRACT: A simple mathematical expression based on rational maps to describe all optical paraxial skyrmion known to date, including Neel-type and Bloch-type skyrmions, bimerons, and anti-skyrmions, is introduced. This expression is derived solely from topological considerations and outlines the rules that fully polarized paraxial light fields must obey to qualify as optical skyrmions. It is shown that rational maps can be implemented experimentally by superposing a pair of orthogonally polarized Laguerre-Gaussian modes. Novel optical skyrmion fields, called multi-skyrmions, are obtained upon generalizing the proposed expression, laying the foundation for the exploration of skyrmion nucleation and annihilation mechanisms in optics.

ABSTRACT: Due to countless orthogonal eigenstates, light beams with orbital angular momentum(OAM) have a large potential information capacity. Recently, deep learning has been extensively applied in recognition of OAM mode. However, previous deep learning methods require a constant distance between laser and receiver. The accuracy will drop quickly if the distance of testing set deviates from the training set. Previous deep learning methods also have difficulty distinguishing OAM modes with positive and negative topological charges. In order to further exploit the huge potential of the countless dimension of state space, we proposed multidimensional information assisted deep learning flexible recognition (MIADLFR) method to make use of both intensity and angular spectrum information for the first time to achieve recognition of OA Mmodes unlimited by the sign of TC and distance with high accuracy. Also, MIADLFR can reduce the computational complexity significantly and requires much smaller training set.

ABSTRACT: Extraordinary Young's interference is an anomalous phenomenon observed at metallic surface in 2004. The shrinkage of slit size into deep subwavelength scale introduces many novel effects that cannot be described by classic interference theory. In this paper, the Young's interference excited by subwavelength slits is investigated via rigorous Maxwell's equations. We reveal a universal spin-orbit interaction mechanism associated with the catenary optical fields in 2D isotropic metal-dielectric structures for the generation of optical vortex array and spin Hall effect. Based on the interference of vectorial vortex arrays with opposite topological charges, a simple yet powerful method for the fabrication of space-variant metasurfaces is proposed for the first time, which breaks the fundamental limit of traditional interference lithography. These results may provide numerous new perspectives on both the design of catenary metasurfaces and optical spin-controlled devices.

ABSTRACT: Ultrafast laser that directly emits vortex beam has broad application prospects in many research fields and applications, such as telecommunication, bio-sampling and quantum information science. In this article, we demonstrate a wavelength-tunable and OAM-switchable ultrafast fiber laser enabled by intracavity polarization controlling elements. The mode-locked laser can emit vortex beam outputs with a topological charge of l = +1 or l = -1 and the center wavelength can be continuously tuned from 1015 nm to 1038nm. The obtained output pulse has a pulse energy of 3.3 nJ and a compressed pulse duration of 87 fs. Compared with previous results, this laser can emit OAM-switchable output with a shorter pulse duration and a broad wavelength tuning range. The concept of adding polarization control elements to a mode-locked fiber laser can be further expanded to build laser with more sophisticated and customizable outputs.

ABSTRACT: Structural boundaries, materials and feeding sources are the three fundamental segments defining photonic devices. Since excitation is usually dictated by the application and there are infinite ways to select the spatial configuration of the component, an optimization with respect to the used media is both doable and useful. We provide several combinations of elements and compounds making high-performing electromagnetic devices in terms of absorption, scattering and unusual refraction with simple structures like bilayers, two- and three-dimensional core-shell particles or binary metasurfaces. Such large sets of potential candidates for the employed media can be deployed by experimentalists after applying a secondary sweep by imposing additional constraints concerning ease of fabrication.

ABSTRACT: Different from conventional two-dimensional photonic metasurfaces, chiral photonic metasurfaces, which are composed of a chiral pattern with subwavelength dimensions, exhibit different chiroptical physical phenom-ena, such as spin-preserving, nonlinear chiroptical effects, and optical vortex generation. However, the effect of symmetry in the vertical direction on the linear and nonlinear response of the chiral quasi-two-dimensional meta -surface has been seldom reported. In this study, we design and simulate a chiral metasurface using topological patterns in lithium niobate (LN) thin film to obtain the optimal circular dichroism and its corresponding non-linear effect. Triangular holes with a certain rotation constitute a quasi-two-dimensional metasurface, which possesses outstanding chirality for the spin state of light, thus allowing it to control linear and nonlinear chirali-ties. The nonlinear conversion efficiency eta SHG reaches 2 x 10-4 and 4 x 10-3 on the LN structure with substrate and without substrate, respectively. Nonlinear circular dichroism CDSHG is 5.8 dB at 783 nm on a SiO2 substrate. This tunable chiral metasurface is expected to be applicable to nonlinear chiroptical responses and chiral light modulation. (c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group

ABSTRACT: We propose an effective approach to generate tunable orbital angular momentum (OAM) beam based on all-fiber fused coupler consisting of a single mode fiber (SMF) and a two-mode fiber. The fundamental mode in the SMF is directly coupled to the LP11 mode group (TE0,1, HE2,1even,odd, TM0,1) by appropriately phase matching the modes in the fiber coupler. The experimental results demonstrate that the OAM beam is produced by combining HE2,1even and TE0,1 (or HE2,1odd and TM0,1) with a pi/2 phase shift and the OAM topological charge could be tuned from l = -1 to l = + 1 by adjusting a polarizer set at the output end of fiber.

ABSTRACT: The recent discovery of the Lorentz symmetry-violating type-II Weyl semimetal phase has renewed interest in the study of Weyl physics in condensed-matter systems. However, tuning the exceptional properties of this novel state has remained a challenge. Optical lattices, created using standing laser beams, provide a convenient platform to tune tunneling parameters continuously in time. In this paper, we propose a generalized two level system exhibiting type-II Weyl points that can be realized using ultracold atoms in an optical lattice. The system is engineered using a three-dimensional lattice with complex p phase tunneling amplitudes. Various unique properties of the type-IIWeyl semimetal such as open Fermi surface, anomalous chirality, and topological Fermi arcs can be probed using the proposed optical lattice scheme.

ABSTRACT: We report on the observation of robust self-trapping of vortex beams propagating in a uniform condensed medium featuring local saturable self-focusing nonlinearity. Optical vortices with topological charge m = 1, that remain self-trapped over approximately five Rayleigh lengths, are excited in carbon disulfide using a helical light beam at 532 nm and intensities from 8 to 10GW/cm(2). At larger intensities, the vortex beams lose their stability, spontaneously breaking into two fragments. Numerical simulations based on the nonlinear Schrodinger equation, including the three-photon absorption and nonpolynomial saturation of the refractive nonlinearity, demonstrate close agreement with the experimental findings.

ABSTRACT: Controlling energy flow in waveguides has attractive potential in integrated devices from radio frequencies to optical bands. Due to the spin-orbit coupling, the mirror symmetry will be broken, and the handedness of the near-field source will determine the direction of energy transport. Compared with well-established theories about spin-momentum locking, experimental visualization of unidirectional coupling is usually challenging due to the lack of generic chiral sources and the strict environmental requirement. In this work, we design a broadband near-field chiral source in the microwave band and discuss experimental details to visualize spin-momentum locking in three different metamaterial waveguides, including spoof surface plasmon polaritons, line waves, and valley topological insulators. The similarity of these edge waves relies on the abrupt sign change of intrinsic characteristics of two media across the interface. In addition to the development of experimental technology, the advantages and research status of interface waveguides are summarized, and perspectives on future research are presented to explore an avenue for designing controllable spin-sorting devices in the microwave band.

ABSTRACT: Optical tweezers (OTs) and optical spanners (OSs) are powerful tools of optical manipulation, which are responsible for particle trapping and rotation, respectively. Conventionally, the OT and OS are built using bulky three-dimensional devices, such as microscope objectives and spatial light modulators. Recently, metasurfaces are proposed for setting up them on a microscale platform, which greatly miniaturizes the systems. However, the realization of both OT and OS with one identical metasurface is posing a challenge. Here, we offer a metasurface-based solution to integrate the OT and OS. Using the prevailing approach based on geometric and dynamic phases, we show that it is possible to construct an output field, which promises a high-numerical-aperture focal spot, accompanied with a coaxial vortex. Optical trapping and rotation are numerically demonstrated by estimating the mechanical effects on a particle probe. Moreover, we demonstrate an on-demand control of the OT-to-OS distance and the topological charge possessed by the OS. By revealing the OT-OS metasurfaces, our results may empower advanced applications in on-chip particle manipulation. (C) 2021 Chinese Laser Press

ABSTRACT: A femtosecond mid-infrared optical vortex laser can be used for high harmonic generation to extend cutoff energy to the kilo-electron-volt range with orbital angular momentum, as well as other secondary radiations. For these, we demonstrate a high-energy femtosecond 4 mu m optical vortex laser based on optical parametric chirped pulse amplification (OPCPA) for the first time. The optical vortex seed is generated from a femtosecond 4 mu m laser by a silicon spiral phase plate with the topological charge l of 1 before the stretcher. Through using a two-stage collinear OPCPA amplifier, the chirped vortex pulse is amplified to 12.4 mJ with 200 nm full width at half-maximum bandwidth. After compression, the vortex laser pulse with 9.53 mJ, 119 fs can be obtained. Furthermore, the vortex characteristics of the laser beam are investigated and evaluated. This demonstration can scale to generate a higher-peak-power vortex mid-IR laser and pave a new way for high field physics. (C) 2020 Chinese Laser Press

ABSTRACT: Physical systems with discrete energy levels are ubiquitous in nature and acre fundamental building blocks of quantum technology. Realizing controllable artificial atom- and molecule-like systems for light would enable coherent and dynamic control of the frequency, amplitude and phase of photons(1-5). In this work, we demonstrate a 'photonic molecule' with two distinct energy levels using coupled lithium niobate microring resonators and control it by external microwave excitation. We show that the frequency and phase of light can be precisely controlled by programmed microwave signals, using concepts of canonical two-level systems including Autler-Townes splitting, Stark shift, Rabi oscillation and Ramsey interference. Through such coherent control, we show on-demand optical storage and retrieval by reconfiguring the photonic molecule into a bright-dark mode pair. These results of dynamic control of light in a programmable and scalable electro-optic system open doors to applications in microwave signal processing(6), quantum photonic gates in the frequency domain(7) and exploring concepts in optical computing(8) and topological physics(3,9).

ABSTRACT: Spin angular momentum (SAM) and orbital angular momentum (OAM), which can provide different orthogonal states as independent information channels, have opened up new avenues in optical communications, imaging processing, and quantum optics. However, detection and analysis of these states concurrently require complicated optical setups, which greatly hinder system integration. Here, a 12-channel detection for SAM and OAM modes based on a single dielectric ultracompact metasurface is introduced and investigated. The phase profile of the metasurface is theoretically constructed by merging both the propagation phase and Pancharatnam-Berry (PB) phase modulations. The former modulation is governed by the geometric parameters of the nanostructures and the latter results from the rotation angle of the nanostructures. A set of Silicon nanobricks are selected as unit cells covering 0 to 2p phase range with transmission over 90% and polarization conversion efficiency over 85%. Adopting spin photonic Hall effect and off-axis focusing scheme, light beams carrying different vortices are demultiplexed into several vortex beams with distinct topological charges, and each can be recognized with different focused solid spots on a transverse plane with unique azimuthal coordinate. SAM modes associated with left/right circular polarization of light and OAM modes with topological charges ranging from 0 to 5 can be simultaneously detected. The proposed optical device provides an efficient method to demultiplex the incident with a superposition of different SAM and OAM modes through a single-layer metasurface, which significantly improves the compactness of the system. We envision this work will pave the way for the development of high-capacity optical communication applications and integrated optical systems.

ABSTRACT: Strong coupling between light and the fundamental excitations of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) is of foundational importance both to pure physics and to the understanding and development of future photonic nanotechnologies(1-7). Here we study the relationship between spin polarization of a 2DEG in a monolayer semiconductor, MoSe2, and light-matter interactions modified by a zero-dimensional optical microcavity. We find pronounced spin-susceptibility of the 2DEG to simultaneously enhance and suppress trion-polariton formation in opposite photon helicities. This leads to observation of a giant effective valley Zeeman splitting for trion-polaritons (g-factor of >20), exceeding the purely trionic splitting by over five times. Going further, we observe clear effective optical nonlinearity arising from the highly nonlinear behaviour of the valley-specific strong light-matter coupling regime, and allowing all-optical tuning of the polaritonic Zeeman splitting from 4 meV to >10 meV. Our experiments lay the groundwork for engineering topological phases with true unidirectionality in monolayer semiconductors, accompanied by giant effective photonic nonlinearities rooted in many-body exciton-electron correlations.

ABSTRACT: "It is difficult to get high compression ratio and good reconstructed image by conventional methods  we give a new method of compression on medical image. It is to decompose and reconstruct the medical image by wavelet packet. Before the construction the image, use neural network in place of other coding, method to code the coefficients in the wavelet packet domain. By using the Kohonen's neural network algorithm, not only for its vector quantization feature, but also for its topological property. This property allows an increase of about 80% for the compression rate. Compared to the JPEG standard, this compression scheme shows better performances (in terms of PSNR) for compression rates higher than 30. This method can get big compression ratio and perfect PSNR. Results show that the image can be compressed greatly and the original image can be recovered well. In addition, the approach can be realized easily by hardware."

ABSTRACT: An equilateral triangular prism is used as the fundamental building block to construct additive Sierpinski fractals, enabling new surface plasmon resonances (SPR) in the first three generations of Sierpinski triangles, as well as topological intermediaries between generations. The modes are characterized using electron energy loss spectroscopy accompanied by eigenmode calculations and optical finite-difference time-domain simulations. The complex fractal geometries present a predictable hierarchy of new resonances, each arising from the previous generational building blocks used to construct the fractal. Intermediate structures break the polarization degeneracy of the equilateral fractals while maintaining a rich multiband spectral response. Engineering defects in the narrow conductive channels of the fractal allows further manipulation of the SPR response, emphasizing higher order SPR modes over the lowest energy peak. The knowledge gained is used to develop guidelines for engineering the response of more complex fractal-based structures, including the spectral response and hotspot distribution.

ABSTRACT: Terahertz vortex beams need to be developed for supporting new applications in fundamental sciences. In this paper, a novel and feasible scheme is presented for generation of helically microbunched electron beam for the emission of terahertz (THz) vortex pulses. In the scheme, a seed laser pulse with longitudinal and azimuthal modulation is firstly produced by optical beating of dual-vortex pulses. Through the laser-electron interaction, such a complex profile of laser can be converted to a periodically azimuth-dependence energy modulation in the electron beam, which finally forms a helical microbunching structure in the beam after a dispersion section. Then, this electron beam is applied to emit THz vortex beams and its quantum number can be continuously tuned by changing the topological charges of the optical laser pulses. This approach is suited to conventional accelerator system consisted of a modulator and a chicane. We expect this presentation can access to new researches in THz science.

ABSTRACT: The generation and manipulation of optical vortices are of fundamental importance in a variety of promising applications. Here, we develop a nonlinear optical paradigm to implement self-and cross-convolution of optical vortex arrays, demonstrating the features of a vortex copier and regenerator. We use a phase-only spatial light modulator to prepare the 1064 nm invisible fundamental light to carry special optical vortex arrays and use a potassium titanyl phosphate crystal to perform type II second-harmonic generation in the Fourier domain to achieve 532 nm visible structured vortices. Based on pure cross-convolution, we succeed in copying arbitrary-order single vortices as well as their superposition states onto a prearranged array of fundamental Gaussian spots. Also, based on the simultaneous effect of self-and cross-convolutions, we can expand the initial vortex lattices to regenerate more vortices carrying various higher topological charges. Our presented method of realizing an optical vortex copier and regenerator could find direct applications in optical manipulation, optical imaging, optical communication, and quantum information processing with structured vortex arrays.

ABSTRACT: An approach to generate the tunable fractional vector curvilinear beams (VCBs) was proposed. The scheme is based on the vector optical field generator (VOFG) system, where the two orthogonal polarized scalar curvilinear beams (SCBs) are generated to be the base vector components, and coaxially superposed by a Ronchi grating. We design a new phase distribution with several loops of 0 to pi in order to generate more dark gaps. The phase distribution becomes nonuniform by varying the phase variation rate and the positions of the dark gaps are changed. Using the different parameters of the curves, the fractional VCBs with different shapes are achieved. The two orthogonal polarized SCBs with the opposite topological charges are modulated to perform the beam conversion by a phase-only computer-generated hologram (CGH). Our experimental results comply with the theory and the radial opening of the dark gaps may have some applications for guiding and transporting particles.

ABSTRACT: It has recently been pointed out that Gaia is capable of detecting a stochastic gravitational wave background in the sensitivity band between the frequency of pulsar timing arrays and LISA. We argue that Gaia and Theia have great potential for early universe cosmology, since such a frequency range is ideal for probing phase transitions in asymmetric dark matter, SIMP and the cosmological QCD transition. Furthermore, there is the potential for detecting primordial black holes in the solar mass range produced during such an early universe transition and distinguish them from those expected from the QCD epoch. Finally, we discuss the potential for Gaia and Theia to probe topological defects and the ability of Gaia to potentially shed light on the recent NANOGrav results.

ABSTRACT: The transverse focal shift (TFS) is a phenomenon that the maximum of a focused field does not occur at the geometrical focus, but is moved a short distance transversely in the focal plane. In this paper, the TFS of vortex beams in a high numerical aperture system is investigated. Four typical types of incident vortex beams are selected and the intensity distributions and the vortices behaviors in the focal region are discussed analytically and numerically. It is found that there are three main parameters, the topological charge, the initial positions of the vortices, and the semiaperture angle influencing the TFS in different ways, and the TFS even can be observed when the vortices annihilate in the focal plane. Our results also show that the intensity maximum can move from the y-axis, x-axis to the geometrical focus, or move from +y-axis to -y-axis in different cases, which may have implications in optical trapping.

ABSTRACT: We investigate the concept that the value of the spin-orbit coupling is the energy efficiency of energy transfer between orthogonal components. The energy efficiency changes as the beam propagates through the crystal. For a fundamental Gaussian beam, its value cannot exceed 50%, while the energy efficiency for Hermite-Gaussian and Laguerre-Gaussian beams of higher orders of the complex argument can reach a value close to 100%. For Hermite-Gauss and Laguerre-Gauss beams of higher orders of real argument, the maximum energy efficiency can only slightly exceed 50%. It is shown that zero-order Bessel-Gauss beams are able to achieve an energy efficiency close to 100% when generating an axial vortex in the orthogonal component in both monochromatic and polychromatic light, while for a polychromatic Laguerre-Gauss or Hermite-Gauss beam of a complex argument, the energy efficiency reduced to a value not exceeding 50%. The spin angular momentum is compensated by changing the orbital angular momentum of the entire beam, which occurs as a result of the difference in the topological charge of the orthogonally polarized component by 2 units.

ABSTRACT: Line laser measurement technology is effective for obtaining the 3D point clouds of complex surfaces. Thus, a 3D gear measurement model is established in this study. All the point clouds of gear surfaces are rapidly obtained using a line laser sensor, and the holistic deviations of gear surfaces are acquired by calculating the normal errors of the gear surface. These informative and complete data include traditional gear error items and considerable valuable information that is not deconstructed. To exploit the acquired gear holistic deviations, the structured 3D model is constructed to express tooth surface errors. In this model, the control method of the statistical process is used to define highly representative assessment indicators, and a new gear accuracy assessment system is developed by selecting reasonable indicators. The measurement practice shows that this method exploits the complete information of the gear surface, including all the current accuracy assessment indicators, which can be used to expand the new assessment indicators. This method can be used to characterize the 3D topological tooth surface completely and comprehensively and realize the deep mining and extended applications of the 3D full information of gear surfaces.

ABSTRACT: A compound plasmonic light analyzer with an elliptical Archimedean spiral nanostructure is proposed analytically and analyzed numerically. The elliptical Archimedean spiral is analogous to an ellipse but has varying semimajor axes. When the structure is illuminated by the incident light with different angular momentum, surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) are excited, and various plasmonic vortexes indicating the angular momentum of the light are generated. Incident light with different spin angular momentum can create plasmonic vortexes centered at different points, and the orbital angular momentum of light determines the size of the vortex, which manifests its topological charge. Thus, both spin and orbital angular momentum states of the incident light can be estimated simultaneously by observing the position and the size of the plasmonic vortex. We provide an analytical description of the structure and it is well consistent with the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) numerical simulation results. This plasmonic light analyzer may provide various potential applications in nanophotonics device and optical information technology.

ABSTRACT: In this paper, we studied transformations of structured light and its angular momentum in a three-coil optical snake - a coil resonator composed of 3 evanescently uniformly coupled coils of a multimode fiber. We have suggested a fully vectorial theory of normal modes of the 3- coil resonator, which takes account of the spin-orbit interaction. On the basis of the analytical expressions for such normal modes and their propagation constants we have studied transmission of some types of structured light beams - optical vortices, Hermite-Gaussian-like and Laguerre-Gaussian beams through such a system. We have shown the possibility of a super-efficient parametric control over the topological charge, orbital and spin angular momenta of the outcoming optical field by this system. We have theoretically demonstrated implementation of logic X and Y Pauli gates for light beams carrying orbital angular momentum on the basis of such a 3-coil resonator.

ABSTRACT: Twist direction and degree of interference fringes collected in double-slit interference experiment can be used to determine the topological properties of vortex beams, and the modulation depth of interference fringes indicates the spatial coherence of vortex beams. The effects of distance between double slits and the initial coherence length of the beam on the visibility and the twist degree of interference fringes in the partially coherent vortex beam topological charge interference measurement are analysed by adjusting the double-slit distance and the coherence length of the partially coherent vortex beam under near-field conditions. The study found that the interference fringes are distorted with the increase of the double slit distance, but the interference fringes and their distortion are not obvious when the initial coherence length of the partially coherent vortex beam is shorter than the beam width. Visible interference fringes will appear when the initial coherence length is longer than the beam width and the twist degree of interference fringes also increase. The coherence length has little effect on the visibility and distortion of the interference fringes when the initial coherence is greater than the size of the light spot on cross-section where the double slits are located, but the distance between the double slits still affects the observation to the visibility of interference fringes and distortion phenomenon. The research results may be useful for the measurement of orbital angular momentum of partially coherent vortex beams.

ABSTRACT: We consider quantum interference effects in carrier and photocurrent excitation in graphene using coherent electromagnetic field components at frequencies omega and 2 omega. The response of the material at the fundamental frequency. is presented, and it is shown that one-photon absorption at. interferes with stimulated electronic Raman scattering (combined 2 omega absorption and omega emission) to result in a net contribution to the current injection. This interference occurs with a net energy absorption of (h) over bar omega and exists in addition to the previously studied interference occurring with a net energy absorption of 2 (h) over bar omega under the same irradiation conditions. Due to the absence of a band gap and the possibility to block photon absorption by tuning the Fermi level, graphene is the perfect material to study this contribution. We calculate the polarization dependence of this all-optical effect for intrinsic graphene and show that the combined response of the material at both omega and 2 omega leads to an anisotropic photocurrent injection, whereas the magnitude of the injection current in doped graphene, when transitions at omega are Pauli blocked, is isotropic. By considering the contribution to coherent current control from stimulated electronic Raman scattering, we find that graphene offers tunable, polarization sensitive applications. Coherent control due to the interference of stimulated electronic Raman scattering and linear absorption is relevant not only for graphene but also for narrow-gap semiconductors, topological insulators, and metals.

ABSTRACT: Light-matter interactions can be mainly described by transitions of electrons,accompanied by emission,absorption,or scattering of photons. Light absorption and emission of atoms,molecules,solids and other substances play a vital role in the development of science and technology.Because of its excellent monochromaticity,directivity and coherence,laser has become a powerful tool to detect the structure and properties of matter. With the development of laser technology,the peak power of the laser pulse reaches the order of 10(15) W and the laser pulse durations decrease to a few femtoseconds. Advanced optical technology makes it possible to carry out experiments at an unprecedented intensity. When the electric field intensity of laser pulse reaches or even exceeds the electric field intensity of the Coulomb potential inside the substances,the concept that the laser field is regarded as a perturbation to the motion of electrons under the constraints of the Coulomb field is no longer applicable,accompanied by a series of highly nonlinear complex dynamic processes,such as multi-photon and above threshold ionization,tunneling ionization, nonsequential double ionization and High Harmonic Generation(HHG). In this context,the emergence of ultrashort and ultra-intense pulses gradually opened up the research of strong field physics. When a macroscopic system is exposed to intense laser fields whose forces are comparable to the binding forces of valence electrons,the system will emit coherent radiation with frequencies many times that of the driving laser field. This non-perturbativeand extremely nonlinear optical phenomenon is calledhigh- order harmonic generation,whichhas become a research direction of great concern in the field of strong field physicsas a Potential Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) source and a possible means of real- time detection of ultrafast dynamics inside matter. In the past 30 years,HHG from gases has been developed greatly based on the physical image of the three-step model,which has laid a solid foundation for attosecond physics. HHG from solids provides a new way to miniaturize devices as a EUV light source and explore the electronic structure of condensed matter system. Meanwhile,in order to find more integrated and compact EUV light source,people gradually turn their attention to solid target. Experimental observation of non-perturbative transmitted high-order harmonics generated from ZnO crystal suggested that the solid-state HHG process can be illustrated neither by conventional perturbative nonlinear optics nor by the kinematics of strong- field re- scattering. More researches demonstrated that solid-state HHG can be achieved through a wide variety of interaction media with suitable laser wavelengths from the near-infrared to terahertz range. High harmonic generation from solid materials driven by an ultrafast strong laser is a fast developing direction in interdisciplinary fields of condensed matter physics,materials science,optics and photonics. So far,the target of solid-state HHG study has been expanded from bulk metals, semiconductors, insulators to low- dimensional nanostructures. Moreover, nonperturbative harmonic signals have been successfully detected in topological insulators and from topological surface states. Compared to gaseous atoms and molecules,solid materials have higher atomic density,and the mechanism of solid-state HHG is more complicated,thus solid-state HHG possesses good application prospects in achieving new light sources, exploring physical properties as well as characterizing microscopic dynamics of materials. This article mainly reviews the experimental and theoretical progresses of solid- state HHG in recent years,and also summarizes its mechanisms and potential applications.

ABSTRACT: Spintronic THz emitters (STEs) rely on spin current acceleration or decay, resulting in a burst of broadband THz emission, offering a new route to THz optics. Here, we demonstrate novel metastructures of STEs for molding the vectorial focal distribution of the emitted THz radiations. The metastructures also allow controlling the characteristics of local fields. Performing combined micromagnetic-electro-magnetic simulations, we demonstrate the generation of broadband THz fields with designed vectorial, chiral, magnetic, or topological features and discuss the potential of these fields for studying magnetic, multiferroic, and chiral structures. The STEs metastructure is shown to produce higher-order electric and magnetic multipoles as well as localized, longitudinal, broadband magnetoelectric THz pulses. Furthermore, subwavelength features of the near fields at a distance less than 10 mu m can be tuned by steering the magnetization of the metastructure. The results point to a new type of engineered STEs for the generation of structured broadband THz fields, with potential applications in the fields of optoelectronics, optics, and ultrafast magnetism.

ABSTRACT: This paper reports the observation of band-edge states at the high-symmetry M-point in the first Brillouin zone of hexagonal and honeycomb plasmonic nanoparticle (NP) lattices. The surface lattice resonance at the M-point (SLRM) of a hexagonal lattice results from asymmetric out-of-plane dipole coupling between NPs. In contrast to the hexagonal lattice, honeycomb lattices support two SLR modes at the M-point because of their non-Bravais nature: (1) a blue-shifted SLRM1 from the coupling of two distinct out-of-plane dipole LSP resonances, and (2) a redshifted SLRM2 from in-plane dipole-dipole coupling. By incorporating organic dye solutions as gain media with Ag NP lattices, we achieved M-point lasing from both hexagonal and honeycomb lattices. Understanding coupling mechanisms at high-symmetry points in NP lattices with the same geometry but different unit cells is important to assess the prospects of topological states in plasmonic systems.

ABSTRACT: A silicon microring resonator with an embedded Bragg grating for orbital angular momentum (OAM) generation is designed and experimentally demonstrated. The device consists of a 3.9 mu m-radius ring resonator with cylindrical silica holes along the central path and exploits the radially polarized component of the propagating electric field in the resonator's strip waveguide, enabling both the bandwidth broadening and the emission efficiency improvement, while reducing the footprint. The experimental results show that the device achieves a 3dB bandwidth of 134 GHz and an efficiency up to 6.5%. The interference patterns are measured for different OAM orders in which the number of spirals are clearly visible proving that the device can support different topological charges. Results are in good agreement with simulations.

ABSTRACT: Recent advances in metasurfaces, i.e., two-dimensional arrays of engineered nanoscale inclusions that are assembled onto a surface, have revolutionized the way to control electromagnetic waves with ultrathin, compact components. The generation of optical vortex beams, which carry orbital angular momentum, has emerged as a vital approach to applications ranging from high-capacity optical communication to parallel laser fabrication. However, the typically bulky elements used for the generation of optical vortices impose a fundamental limit toward on-chip integration with subwavelength footprints. Here, we investigate and experimentally demonstrate a three-dimensional volumetric optical vortices generation based on light matter interaction with a high-efficiency dielectric metasurface. By employing the concepts of Dammann vortex gratings and spiral Dammann zone plates, a 3D optical vortex array with micrometer spatial separation is achieved from visible to near-infrared wavelengths. Importantly, we show that the topological charge controlled by the design. distribution can be spatially variant and fully

ABSTRACT: Optical vortices have emerged as a potential approach to enhance data capacity for its extra degree of freedom of orbital angular momentum. Although linear metasurfaces have been used to generate optical vortices, their capacity can be further increased by involving nonlinear frequency conversions, providing new channels for data storage. Here, by introducing second harmonic Pancharatnam-Berry phase, one linear and two second harmonic optical vortices with different topological charges focused into different focal lengths can be generated simultaneously from the proposed metasurface, which can store threefold optical vortices compared with the conventional linear geometric metasurfaces have been demonstrated. Besides, the 2D multifocal metalens with same strength for each focus emerged from the parabolic phase factor has been experimentally observed. This nonlinear optical vortex generation process represents a new strategy for enhancing the capacity of optical communications and multi-channels integrated optical communications.

ABSTRACT: Interlayer vibrations with discrete quantized modes in two-dimensional (2D) materials can be excited by ultrafast light due to the inherent low dimensionality and van der Waals force as a restoring force. Controlling such interlayer vibrations in layered materials, which are closely related to fundamental nanomechanical interactions and thermal transport, in spatial- and time-domain provides an in-depth understanding of condensed matters and potential applications for advanced phononic and photonics devices. The manipulation of interlayer vibrational modes has been implemented in a spatial domain through material design to develop novel optoelectronic and phononic devices with various 2D materials, but such control in a time domain is still lacking. We present an all-optical method for controlling the interlayer vibrations in a highly precise manner with Bi2Se3 as a promising optoelectronic and thermoelasticity material in layered structures using a coherently controlled pump and probe scheme. The observed thickness-dependent fast interlayer breathing modes and substrate-induced slow interfacial modes can be exactly explained by a modified linear chain model including coupling effect with substrate. In addition, the results of coherent control experiments also agree with the simulation results based on the interference of interlayer vibrations. This investigation is universally applicable for diverse 2D materials and provides insight into the interlayer vibration-related dynamics and novel device implementation based on an ultrafast timescale interlayer-spacing modulation scheme.

ABSTRACT: After the discovery that focused laser pulse is capable to locally change material's refractive index it became possible to integrate various photonic devices or data directly into the volume of transparent material, usually with conventional Direct Laser Writing (DLW) techniques. Many different photonic devices, passive or active, integrated in different materials were demonstrated. In majority of cases the change in refractive index comes from rearrangement (damage) of materials' lattice and are permanent. Metastable (reversible) modifications can be beneficial for some applications and these could be realized in photorefractive crystals such as lithium niobate. While photorefractive data recording is a well studied process in holographic applications, the photorefractive induction via femtosecond laser pulses is scarcely investigated. In this work we demonstrate the possibility to form discrete regions of homogeneously-altered refractive index in bulk of pure and iron doped lithium niobate crystals using femtosecond DLW technique. We show that non-linear free charge generation and charge separation caused by the bulk photovoltaic effect are the main contributing factors to the change in refractive index. Moreover, femtosecond pulse induced refractive index change can be by an order of magnitude higher than values reached with longer laser pulses. Femtosecond DLW opens opportunities for precise control of topological charge separation in lithium niobate crystals in volume and in micrometer scale. Various examples as well as strategies to control and manipulate refractive index change is presented and discussed.

ABSTRACT: The upsurge of new materials that can be used for near-infrared (NIR) photodetectors operated without cooling is crucial. As a novel material with a small bandgap of approximate to 0.28 eV, the topological crystalline insulator SnTe has attracted considerable attention. Herein, this work demonstrates self-driven NIR photodetectors based on SnTe/Si and SnTe:Si/Si heterostructures. The SnTe/Si heterostructure has a high detectivity D* of 3.3 x 10(12) Jones. By Si doping, the SnTe:Si/Si heterostructure reduces the dark current density and increases the photocurrent by approximate to 1 order of magnitude simultaneously, which improves the detectivity D* by approximate to 2 orders of magnitude up to 1.59 x 10(14) Jones. Further theoretical analysis indicates that the improved device performance may be ascribed to the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE), in which doped Si atoms break the inversion symmetry and thus enable the generation of additional photocurrents beyond the heterostructure. In addition, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) measured at room temperature at 850 nm increases by a factor of 7.5 times, from 38.5% to 289%. A high responsivity of 1979 mA W-1 without bias and fast rising time of 8 mu s are also observed. The significantly improved photodetection achieved by the Si doping is of great interest and may provide a novel strategy for superior photodetectors.

ABSTRACT: Exciton-polaritons in 2D lattice geometries now attract considerable attention as systems in which to explore new physics. However, such structures are relatively difficult to fabricate as this can involve sophisticated milling or etching of cavity layers to create arrays of defects. Here, a straightforward technique is reported that allows rapid fabrication of 2D polariton lattices that operate at room temperature. Specifically, laser patterning has been used to write a 2D square lattice of defects into a sacrificial polymer layer. An organic microcavity structure is then built on top of the patterned polymer, with the morphology of the patterned polymer propagating through the subsequent layers and spatially modifying the optical path length of the active cavity region. Using real- and momentum-space spectroscopy, the formation of gapped polaritonic band structures has been demonstrated at room temperature. The optical writing approach discussed here opens up the way for fabrication of more complex 2D-lattice geometries for studying topological physics at room temperature.

ABSTRACT: Kagome lattices supporting Dirac cones and flatband dispersions are well-known as a highly frustrated, two-dimensional lattice system. Particularly, the flatbands therein are attracting continuous interest based on their link to topological order, correlations, and frustration. In this work, we realize coupled microcavity implementations of Kagome lattices hosting exciton-polariton quantum fluids of light. We demonstrate precise control over the dispersiveness of the flatband as well as selective condensation of exciton-polaritons into the flatband. Subsequently, we focus on the spatial and temporal coherence properties of the laserlike emission from these polariton condensates that are closely connected to the flatband nature of the system. Notably, we find a drastic increase in coherence time due to the localization of flatband condensates. Our work illustrates the outstanding suitability of the exciton-polariton system for detailed studies of flatband states as a platform for microlaser arrays in compact localized states, including strong interactions, topology, and nonlinearity.

ABSTRACT: "CONSPECTUS: Rationally assembled nanostructures exhibit distinct physical and chemical properties beyond their individual units. Developments in nanofabrication techniques have enabled the patterning of a wide range of nanomaterial designs over macroscale (>in.(2)) areas. Periodic metal nanostructures show long-range diffractive interactions when the lattice spacing is close to the wavelength of the incident light. The collective coupling between metal nanoparticles in a lattice introduces sharp and intense plasmonic surface lattice resonances, in contrast to the broad localized resonances from single nanoparticles. Plasmonic nanoparticle lattices exhibit strongly enhanced optical fields within the subwavelength vicinity of the nanoparticle unit cells that are 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of individual units. These intense electromagnetic fields can manipulate nanoscale processes such as photocatalysis, optical spectroscopy, nonlinear optics, and light harvesting. This Account focuses on advances in exciton-plasmon coupling and light-matter interactions with plasmonic nanoparticle lattices. First, we introduce the fundamentals of ultrasharp surface lattice resonances  these resonances arise from the coupling of the localized surface plasmons of a nanoparticle to the diffraction mode from the lattice. Second, we discuss how integrating dye molecules with plasmonic nanoparticle lattices can result in an architecture for nanoscale lasing at room temperature. The lasing emission wavelength can be tuned in real time by adjusting the refractive index environment or varying the lattice spacing. Third, we describe how manipulating either the shape of the unit cell or the lattice geometry can control the lasing emission properties. Low-symmetry plasmonic nanoparticle lattices can show polarization-dependent lasing responses, and multiscale plasmonic superlattices-finite patches of nanoparticles grouped into microscale arrays-can support multiple plasmon resonances for controlled multimodal nanolasing. Fourth, we discuss how the assembly of photoactive emitters on the nanocavity arrays behaves as a hybrid materials system with enhanced exciton plasmon coupling. Positioning metal-organic framework materials around nanoparticles produces mixed photon modes with strongly enhanced photoluminescence at wavelengths determined by the lattice. Deterministic coupling of quantum emitters in two-dimensional materials to plasmonic lattices leads to preserved single-photon emission and reduced decay lifetimes. Finally, we highlight emerging applications of nanoparticle lattices from compact, fully reconfigurable imaging devices to solid-state emitter structures. Plasmonic nanoparticle lattices are a versatile, scalable platform for tunable flat optics, nontrivial topological photonics, and modified chemical reactivities."

ABSTRACT: Photopolymerization is a powerful technique to create arbitrary micro-objects with a high spatial resolution. Importantly, to date all photopolymerization studies have been performed with incident light fields with planar wavefronts and have solely exploited the intensity profile of the incident beam. We investigate photopolymerization with light fields possessing orbital angular momentum, characterized by the topological charge 1. We show both experimentally and theoretically that, as a consequence of nonlinear self-focusing of the optical field, photopolymerization creates an annular shaped vortex-soliton and an associated optical fiber, which breaks up into [l] solitons or microfibers. These microfibers exhibit helical trajectories with a chirality determined by the sign of 1 due to the orbital angular momentum of the light field and form a bundle of helical-microfibers. This research opens up a new application for light fields with orbital angular momentum, and our generated microfibers may have applications in optical communications and micromanipulation.

ABSTRACT: The challenge of bridging the terahertz gap with semiconductor lasers faces an inevitable problem of enhanced nonradiative Auger recombination with reduction of photon energy. We show that this problem can be mitigated in mercury-cadmium-telluride quantum wells (HgCdTe QWs), wherein the Auger process is suppressed due to formation of highly symmetric quasi-relativistic electron-hole dispersion imposing strong energy-momentum restrictions on recombining carriers. Such dispersion is formed upon interaction of topological states at the two QW interfaces. We characterize the lasing properties of HgCdTe QWs quantitatively by constructing a microscopic theory for recombination, absorption, and gain and show the feasibility of lasing up to similar to 50 mu m wavelength at liquid nitrogen temperature with threshold currents two orders of magnitude lower than in existing lasers. Our findings comply with recent experimental data on stimulated far-infrared emission from HgCdTe QWs and show the directions toward achievement of maximum possible lasing wavelength.

ABSTRACT: With the development of precision optical engineering, higher manufacturing qualities are demanded for advanced optical systems. The characterization of the surface topographies of optical elements is required to be more specific and more comprehensive. In this paper, the contourlet transform is adopted to extract the topological features of optical elements. The performance of the contourlet transform(CT) is analyzed carefully. The multiscale analysis techniques based on contourlet transform for peak/pit extraction, tool trace identification and sharp edge detection on non-smooth microstructured optical surfaces were shown. The experimental examples are given to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.

ABSTRACT: Exceptional points (EPs) are degeneracies of non-Hermitian operators where, in addition to the eigenvalues, the corresponding eigenmodes become degenerate. Classical and quantum photonic systems with EPs have attracted tremendous attention due to their unusual properties, topological features, and an enhanced sensitivity that depends on the order of the EP, i.e., the number of degenerate eigenmodes. Yet, experimentally engineering higher-order EPs in classical or quantum domains remain an open challenge due to the stringent symmetry constraints that are required for the coalescence of multiple eigenmodes. Here, we analytically show that the number-resolved dynamics of a single, lossy waveguide beam splitter, excited by N indistinguishable photons and post-selected to the N-photon subspace, will exhibit an EP of order N + 1. By using the well-established mapping between a beam splitter Hamiltonian and the perfect state transfer model in the photon-number space, we analytically obtain the time evolution of a general N-photon state and numerically simulate the system's evolution in the post-selected manifold. Our results pave the way toward realizing robust, arbitrary-order EPs on demand in a single device. (C) 2019 Chinese Laser Press

ABSTRACT: Optical metamaterials and metasurfaces, which emerged in the course of the last few decades, have revolutionized our understanding of light and light-matter interaction. While solid materials are naturally employed as key building elements for construction of optical metamaterials mainly due to their structural stability, practically no attention was given to study of liquid-made optical two-dimensional (2-D) metasurfaces and the underlying interaction regimes between surface optical modes and liquids. We theoretically demonstrate that surface plasmon polaritons and slab waveguide modes that propagate within a thin liquid dielectric film trigger optical self-induced interaction facilitated by surface tension effects, which leads to the formation of 2-D optical liquid-made lattices/metasurfaces with tunable symmetry and can be leveraged for tuning of lasing modes. Furthermore, we show that the symmetry breaking of the 2-D optical liquid lattice leads to phase transition and tuning of its topological properties, which allows the formation, destruction, and movement of Dirac-points in the k-space. Our results indicate that optical liquid lattices support extremely low lasing threshold relative to solid dielectric films and have the potential to serve as configurable analogous computation platform.

ABSTRACT: Light beams carrying spin angular momentum (SAM) and orbital angular momentum (OAM) have created novel opportunities in the areas of optical communications, imaging, micromanipulation, and quantum optics. However, complex optical setups are required to simultaneously manipulate, measure, and analyze these states, which significantly limit system integration. Here, a detection approach is introduced for measuring multiple SAM and OAM modes simultaneously through a planar nanophotonic demultiplexer based on an all-dielectric metasurface. Coaxial light beams carrying multiple SAM and OAM states of light upon transmission through the demultiplexer are spatially separated into a range of vortex beams with different topological charge, each propagating along a specific wavevector. The broadband response and momentum conservation further enable the demultiplexer to achieve wavelength demultiplexing. The ultracompact multifunctional architecture is envisioned to enable simultaneous manipulation and measurement of polarization and spin encoded photon states with applications in integrated quantum optics and optical communications.

ABSTRACT: Based on the Richards-Wolf (RW) formalism, we obtain two different exact expressions for the angular momentum (AM) density of light in the focus of an optical vortex with a topological charge n and right circular polarization. One expression for the AM density is derived as the cross product of the position vector and the Poynting vector and has a nonzero value in the focus for an arbitrary integer n. Another expression for the AM density is equal to a sum of the orbital angular momentum (OAM) and the spin angular momentum (SAM) and, in the focus of a considered light field, is equal to zero at n = -1. These expressions are not equal at each point in space, but their 3D integrals are equal. Thus, we derive exact expressions for the AM, SAM and OAM densities in the focus of an optical vortex with right circular polarization and demonstrate that the identity for the densities AM = SAM + OAM is not valid. In addition, we show that the expressions for the strength vectors of the electric and magnetic field near the tight focus, obtained on the basis of the RW formalism, are exact solutions of Maxwell's equations. Thus, the RW theory exactly describes the behavior of light near the tight focus in free space.

ABSTRACT: We present an elliptic annular optical vortex array (EOVA), whose annular eccentricity can be freely adjusted. The EOVA is generated by coherent superposition of two elliptic perfect optical vortices (EPOVs) with the same eccentricity. The vortex number and sign of the EOVA are determined by the difference of the topological charges (TCs) of these two EPOVs. Continuously increasing the initial phase difference between the EPOVs, each vortex of the EOVA can be rotated on the elliptic ring. Moreover, the birth process of a vortex is visualized by changing the TC of one of the EPOVs from an integer to the adjacent integer in steps of 0.1. This letter demonstrates a different spatial-structured optical vortex array, which is of significance in applications such as optical tweezers and micro-particle manipulation.

ABSTRACT: Owing to their unique optical properties and new degrees of freedom, orbital angular momentum (OAM) beams have been applied in various fields. Detection of the topological charges (TCs) of OAM beams is the key step for their applications. However, on-chip sorting of OAM beams with large TCs still remains a challenge. In this paper, Bloch surface wave (BSW) structures with five semi-ring shaped nanoslits are modeled. A spatial separation of 135 nm on the chip is obtained between two neighboring OAM states. OAM beams with TCs up to 35 can be successfully sorted by the BSW structures, which is much larger than that using metallic structures (only seven). BSW structures exhibit better OAM sorting performances than metallic structures. We systematically show how the lower attenuation of BSW structures leads to far superior separation ability compared to surface plasmons propagating on metallic structures. In addition, sorting of two OAM beams with different TCs simultaneously can be achieved in this way. Our results reveal that BSW structures should be an excellent solution for OAM sorting with large TCs, which is beneficial for applications in integrated on-chip devices and optical communications.

ABSTRACT: A novel optical multiple-image hiding method is proposed based on two cascaded free-space propagation transforms in this paper. With the use of the structured phase mask in the phase retrieval algorithm, a plain image is encoded to only one statistically independent phase-only mask. All retrieved phase masks are integrated into the noise-like ciphertext by using the phase mask multiplexing technique. When reconstructing an original plain image, the architecture of double random phase encoding system is directly adopted, where the structured phase mask and the corresponding decryption key mask are located at determined positions along the axis of propagation. Besides the propagation distances, the optical parameters such as wavelength, focal length, and topological charge of the structured mask are considered as the security keys to expand the key space. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first report on employing the structured phase mask in the process of phase retrieval algorithm, which can enhance the level of security greatly. Simulation results have been given to verify the feasibility and robustness of the proposed scheme.

ABSTRACT: Broadband and efficient terahertz absorbing films are crucial to high-performance terahertz detectors, which are in demand for next-generation wireless communications, astronomy, security screening, medical imaging and so on. Recent studies reported a series of two-dimensional materials for enhanced light absorption in terahertz waves, such as graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides and topological insulators, among others. However, it is still challenging to achieve the intrinsic thin-film absorption limit (50%) across the whole ultrabroad terahertz band. Here we demonstrate that ultrathin 10.2-nm-thick (similar to lambda/30,000) Ti3C2Tx MXene assemblies can reach the intrinsic thin-film absorption limit across the entire 0.5-10 THz band. Such intriguing phenomena are attributed to the highly concentrated free electrons (similar to 10(21) cm(-3)), short relaxation time (similar to 10 fs) and unique intra- and interflake (hopping) electron transport properties in Ti3C2Tx MXenes. Our results are validated by alternating current impedance theory using the Drude-Smith model, rather than classic direct current impedance matching. We believe that our findings will stimulate more studies of broadband terahertz technologies with MXenes and beyond, providing a route to developing compact, supercontinuum terahertz optoelectronic or photothermoelectric devices.

ABSTRACT: In this work, we analyze the effects of the presence of waveguides in a wireless on-chip optical channel, which act as obstacles for the rays composing the propagating signal. The analysis has been performed numerically by using the FDTD method, and the simulation results have been validated by the experimental characterization. This work focuses on the relationship between the received signal and the position of the obstacles on the circuit plane in a multilayered channel made of heterogeneous dielectric cladding. We show how the crossing waveguide perturbates the received power and we provide ad hoc guidelines for the best topological choices allowing to mitigate losses. Moreover, with a good agreement between numerical and experimental results, amounting to a variation of less than 1 dB, we have demonstrated that the effects of this perturbation in real chips can be predicted. The results of this analysis, as well as increasing the level of knowledge of on-chip optical wireless links, allow a better comprehension and control of unbound optical signals within the optical chip environment.

ABSTRACT: In this paper, using a Richards-Wolf method, which describes the behavior of electromagnetic waves at the sharp focus, we show that high-order spin and orbital Hall effects take place at the focal plane of tightly focused laser beams. We reveal that four local subwavelength regions are formed at the focus of a linearly polarized optical vortex with unit topological charge, where the spin angular momentum behaves in a special way. Longitudinal projections of the spin angular momentum are oppositely directed in the adjacent regions. We conclude that this is because photons falling into the neighboring regions at the focus have the opposite spin. This newly observed phenomenon may be called a spin Hall effect of the 4-th order. We also show that tightly focusing the superposition of cylindrical vector beams of the m-th and zero-order produces 2m subwavelength regions in the focal plane, such that longitudinal projections of the orbital angular momentum are oppositely directed in the neighboring regions. This occurs because photons falling into the neighboring regions at the focus have the opposite signs of the on-axis projections of the orbital angular momentum. This phenomenon may be termed an orbital Hall effect of the 2m-th order.

ABSTRACT: The Soleil-Babinet compensator (SBC) is a variable retarder and has been used in a variety of application fields. A scheme based on the vectorial optical field is proposed to calibrate the SBC by transforming the change of the phase retardation into the visible rotation of the petal-like pattern. The relationship between the rotation angle of the petal-like pattern and the phase retardation of the SBC is established theoretically. In the experiment, the vector beam is generated by using the spiral phase plate (SPP) and the modified Mach-Zehnder interferometer based on the superposition principle of two orthogonal circularly polarized vortex beams with opposite topological charges. Taking advantage of the image processing method, the rotation angles of the acquired petal patterns are calculated, and the relationship between the phase retardation of the SBC and the displacements of its micrometer screw is determined. The measured phase retardation of the SBC ranges from -277.00 degrees to 516.57 degrees. By linearly fitting the experimental data, the phase sensitivity is 33.076 +/- 0.147 degrees/mm, and the coefficient of determination value that shows the linearity of the experimental data is 0.9995. The experimental results agree well with the theoretical data.

ABSTRACT: We report a scheme to generate broadband first-order linear polarization (LP11) modes and optical vortex beams (OVBs) emitted by a figure-9 femtosecond mode-locked (ML) fiber laser connecting a broad long-period fiber grating (BLPFG) inside and outside the cavity, respectively. When the group velocities between the core modes of LP01 and LP11 in a two-mode fiber (TMF) are matched, the BLPFG can achieve broadband mode conversion with a 3-dB bandwidth of 160 nm. Moreover, the mode purity of output LP11 measured through a 4-f system is higher than 98%. The generation of OVBs can be verified by employing a self-interference system to detect the phase singularity and topological charge. The study of broadband OVBs promotes the development in optical trapping, optical communications and so on.

ABSTRACT: Based on the Richard-Wolf diffraction theory, we demonstrate the tightly focused optical field distribution with two beams circularly polarized light. We deduced the expression of the double-beam superimposed vortex light intensity of left-handed circularly polarized light and right-handed circularly polarized light under the focusing condition of a high numerical aperture objective lens. Based on the different vortex topological charge values, amplitudes and initial phases of the dual beams, we numerically simulated the light intensity distribution of the superimposed hybrid focused light field. It is found that a variety of peculiar vortex spots can be obtained through the tight focus stacking of the double beams. These complex hybrid focused light fields with different polarizations can be used in fields such as optical field micro-manipulation or nonlinear fluorescence microscopy imaging.

ABSTRACT: Cylindrical vector beams (CVBs) detection is of vital significance in various kinds of studies such as particle observation and mode-division multiplexing (MDM). Herein, a comprehensive detection of CVBs based on the rotational Doppler effect (RDE) including analysis of topological charge (TC), relative amplitude module, and phase for superimposed mode bases is realized. A mode demultiplexing scheme is constructed through the complex amplitude of the harmonic terms in the beating signal. The method resolves both absolute values and signs of the TC of CVB simultaneously, which cannot be simply realized by existing polarization examination techniques. It may be of big potential in related research since an efficient, quantitative, and complete scheme to detect CVBs is verified starting from this work.

ABSTRACT: Traditional technologies to generate and manipulate the orbital angular momentum (OAM) suffer from bulky size and do not lend themselves to nanophotonic systems. An ultrathin metasurface based on abrupt phase shift has recently been proposed as an alternative method. Nevertheless, gradient phase was generally approximated by multiple meta-atom/molecules with discrete levels of abrupt phase shift, which not only increases the design and fabrication complexity but also causes difficulties in obtaining simultaneous electrical and optical functionality. Furthermore, a discontinuous phase profile would introduce phase noise to the scattering fields and deteriorate the purity of the OAM beams. Here, we propose a wavefront engineering mechanism by virtue of the spin-orbit interaction in continuously shaped plasmonic metasurfaces, which offers a new approach to generate OAM modes of high purity. Equally important, a method producing arbitrary OAM topological charge, integral and fractional, is demonstrated by merging the plasmon retardation phase with the geometric phase in the proposed continuously shaped metasurfaces. The proposed approach is well supported by full-wave numerical simulations and experimental characterization of the fabricated structure in the visible regime.

ABSTRACT: Optical vortex beams carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) have received great attention since the 1990s. In particular, OAM offers an additional degree of freedom, thus, enabling boosting of data transmission capacity in communication systems. One of the major challenges of OAM-based communication lies in multiplexing OAM via a kind of effective, compact, and flexible approach. Here, a novel approach to achieve the generation and combination of OAM beams by a pre-engineered reflective metasurface chip is demonstrated. Compared to traditional methods of OAM generation, this approach shows superiorities of broadband operating wavelength, high mode purity, flexible design, and compact size. Moreover, a free-space OAM multiplexing communication experiment based on the single metasurface is successfully carried out, performing 448 Gbit s(-1) data transmission with four different topological charges of OAM and two polarizations by 28-GBaud QPSK signals. This work experimentally demonstrates promising applications of the metasurface in high-capacity optical communication systems.

ABSTRACT: We numerically investigated the focusing of optical vortices with topological charge of 2, wavelength of 532 nm and circular polarization by a diffractive lens with a numerical aperture NA = 0.95. The simulation was carried out using the Richards-Wolf formulae and FDTD-method. It was shown that the focusing of optical vortices with circular polarization by a wide-aperture diffractive lens can produce intensity distribution with a negative component of the longitudinal component of the Poynting vector.

ABSTRACT: Spatiotemporal modulation has shown great promise as a strong time-reversal symmetry breaking mechanism that enables integrated nonreciprocal devices and topological materials at optical frequencies. However, ideal circulator and isolator performance has relied on spatial symmetry or momentum matching between modulation and optical modes. The resulting systems have been challenging to experimentally realize, due to the prohibitively complex and lossy biasing networks and tight fabrication tolerances that maintain the desired rotational and mirror symmetries. In this work, we propose a microresonator Floquet circulator that leverages the previously untapped degrees of freedom of the modulation, through waveforms with strong harmonic components. The Floquet circulator response exhibits ideal on-resonance isolation and supports broadband forward transmission with no trade-off in insertion loss. We present a numerical demonstration in an on-chip photonic crystal platform with just two modulated resonators requiring no rotational symmetry. Moreover, this approach is general and can leverage a variety of modulation mechanisms while not being limited by pump depletion and signal distortion associated with parametric nonlinear systems.

ABSTRACT: Metasurfaces have shown unprecedented capabilities and flexibilities for optical wave manipulation, which provide a powerful platform for the integration and minimization of multifunctional optical devices. However, the realization of the multidimensional manipulation of harmonic waves generated by nonlinear metasurfaces is still a challenge due to the lack of a theoretical guidance. Here, an efficient design strategy of nonlinear metasurfaces based on the hydrodynamic model of the free electron dynamics is demonstrated to realize the full complex-amplitude modulation of the second harmonic generation (SHG). As a proof concept, three multifunctional nonlinear metasurfaces are designed, in which both the amplitude and the phase of the SHG waves are efficiently and independently manipulated. With numerical and experimental validations, the proposed nonlinear metasurfaces can realize the spin-selective SHG optical vortices with independent topological charges. The design strategy of nonlinear metasurfaces shall boost the applications of nonlinear metasurfaces in optical information, optical multifunctional integration, and so on.

ABSTRACT: Orbital angular momentum (OAM)-based optical encryption transmission plays an important role in optical communications. However, it remains challenging to encrypt the data with great security and decrypt them with high fidelity while maintaining large-capacity transmission. In this paper, we propose a novel optical encryption transmission technique, which dynamically converts OAM modes into speckle patterns with a randomly shaking diffuser for high-security encryption, and a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) is later employed to extract encoded information hidden in the speckle patterns for high-fidelity information decryption. Our experiment demonstrates that the modulated OAM with an interval of a topological charge as small as 0.01 can be recognized by the CNN with an accuracy of 99.83%. To demonstrate its application, a cat image, encoded and encrypted by the designed system, has been successfully decrypted and decoded with a bit error rate of 0.008%. The security mechanism of the technique has also been experimentally verified and discussed. This technique thereby provides a new avenue for OAM-based encrypted optical information transmission.

ABSTRACT: Orbital angular momentum (OAM) has received considerable attention regarding high-capacity communication owing to its spatial orthogonality. However, it is still challenging to build a compact communication system that can generate multiple coaxial OAM beams and receive information from each. In this work, OAM multiplexing and demultiplexing at the E-band frequency using a single metasurface structure is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. For OAM multiplexing, the metasurface used as a transceiver generates two orthogonal coaxial OAM beams for Gaussian incident beams with different incidence angles. For OAM demultiplexing, the same metasurface flipped 180 degrees as a receiver forms a Gaussian beam in different off-axis directions depending on the topological charge of the coaxially incident OAM beam. The Gaussian beam measured at the receiver end exhibits a high signal-to-noise ratio of more than 33 dB compared with the background OAM beam. OAM multiplexing and demultiplexing based on a single metasurface may provide a route for high-capacity and compact free-space communication systems.

ABSTRACT: We report on the theoretical investigation of plasmonic resonances in metallic Mobius nanorings. Half-integer numbers of resonant modes are observed due to the presence of an extra phase pi provided by the topology of the Mobius nanostrip. Anomalous plasmon modes located at the non-orientable surface of the Mobius nanoring break the symmetry that exist in conventional ring cavities, thus enable far-field excitation and emission as bright modes. The far-field resonant wavelength as well as the feature of half-integer mode numbers is constant to the change of charge distribution on the Mobius nanoring due to the topology of Mobius ring. Owing to the ultra-small mode volume induced by the remaining dark feature, an extremely high sensitivity as well as a remarkable figure of merit is obtained in our numerical calculations for sensing performance. The topological metallic nanostructure provides a novel platform for the investigation of localized surface plasmon modes exhibiting unique phenomena for potential plasmonic applications.

ABSTRACT: The combinatorial topological analysis and modeling of self-assembly of the K78In160-hP238 (space group P-3m1, a = b = 17.211, c = 28.888 angstrom, V = 7410 angstrom(3)) and K8In11-hR114 (space group R-3c, a = b = 10.021 angstrom, c = 50.891 angstrom, V = 4426 angstrom(3)) crystal structures are performed by computer methods (the ToposPro software package). Icosahedra In-12 (with the -3m symmetry) are the templates on which three-layer clusters K130 = 0@12(In-12)@30(In12K18)@86(K20In66) with the diameter of 17 angstrom are formed. The two-layer cluster K66 formed on Friauf polyhedra K(K4In12) (with 3m symmetry) has a chemical composition of shells K@16(K4In12)@49(K16In33) and a diameter of 14 angstrom. The K130 and K66 nanoclusters are framework-forming and involved in the formation of 2D layers A and B, respectively, thus forming a three-layer B-A-B package. The In-12 clusters (with the -3m symmetry), In-8 hexagonal bipyramids (with the 3m symmetry), and K spacer atoms are located in the voids of the layer of the K66 clusters. The three-layer package thickness corresponds to the value of the translation vector modulus c = 28.888 angstrom. The framework structure is formed by linking the three-layer B-A-B packages in the [001] direction. The cluster precursor K17 = 0@In11K6 is installed for K8In11-hR114 in the form of a triangular In-5 bipyramid on six faces of which In atoms are located with six bound potassium atoms. The microlayer is formed when the primary chains are bound in the (001) plane with a shift. The localization of the K spacer atoms takes place in the layer. The microframework of the structure is formed when the microlayers are bound with a shift.

ABSTRACT: Perfect optical vortices (POVs) provide a solution to address the challenge induced by strong dependence of classical optical vortices on their carried topological charges. However, traditional POVs are all shaped into bright rings with a single main lobe along the radial direction. Here we propose a method for enhanced control on the ring profile (the radial intensity profile of circular rings) of POVs based on modulated circular sine/cosine radial functions, which is realized by a circular Dammann grating embedded with a spiral phase. Specifically, a type of absolute dark POVs surrounded by two bright lobe rings in each side is presented, which provides a perfect annular potential well along those dark impulse rings for trapping low-index particles, cells, or quantum gases. In addition, several POVs with different ring profiles, including conventional POVs with bright rings, the dark POVs mentioned above, and also POVs with tunable ring profiles, are demonstrated. This work opens up new possibilities to controllably tune the ring profile of perfect vortices, and this type of generalized POVs will enrich the content of singular optics and expand the application scope of perfect vortices in a range of areas including optical manipulation, both quantum and dassical optical communications, enhanced optical imaging, and also novel structured pumping lasers.

ABSTRACT: Perfect optical vortices (POVs), characterized as a ring radius independent of topological charge (TC), possess extensive application in particle manipulation and optical communication. At present, the complex and bulky optical device for generating POVs has been miniaturized by leveraging the metasurface, and either spindependent or spin-independent POV conversions have been further accomplished. Nevertheless, it is still challenging to generate superposed POVs for incidences with orthogonal circular polarization. Here, a spinmultiplexed all-dielectric metasurface method for generating superposed POVs in the terahertz frequency range is proposed and demonstrated. By using the multiple meta-atom comprised structure as the basic unit, the complex amplitude of two superposed POVs is modulated, decoupled, and subsequently encoded to left- and righthanded circular polarization incidences. Furthermore, two kinds of metasurfaces are fabricated and characterized to validate this controlling method. It is demonstrated that the measured intensity and phase distributions match well with the calculation of the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld diffraction integral, and the radius of superposed POVs is independent of TCs. This work provides promising opportunities for developing ultracompact terahertz functional devices applied to complex structured light generation and terahertz communication, and exploring sophisticated spin angular momentum and orbital angular momentum interactions like the photonic spin-Hall effect.

ABSTRACT: Raman scattering among conventional linearly polarized (LP) modes in single mode optical fibers is generally accepted as a promising way to achieve distributed amplification due to the fact that Raman amplification may provide gain at any wavelength, determined by the used pump wavelength, and excellent noise performance. Here, we show that Raman scattering among orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes in optical fibers have similar properties. We show theoretically that the Raman gain among OAM modes is independent on the topological charge of the OAM modes and that the gain efficiency when the pump and signal are parallel (orthogonally) polarized is similar to the Raman scattering among LP modes in parallel (orthogonal) states of polarization. In addition, we experimentally characterize Raman gain among OAM modes in a fiber supporting multiple OAM modes for both the pump and signal. Finally, we discuss the impact of polarization mode dispersion. (C) 2019 Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Optical angular momentum (OAM)-based structured light beams provide an additional degree of freedom for practical applications ranging from optical communication to laser-based material processing. Many techniques exist for generating such beams within laser sources and these primarily rely upon the use of specially designed optical components that limit laser power scaling and ready tunability of the topological charge and polarization of the output OAM beams. Here we show that some of these limitations can be overcome by employing a computer controlled reflective phase-only spatial light modulator to adaptively tailor the input (and subsequent output) beam wavefront and polarization in a few-mode fiber amplifier. In this way modal-coupling-induced beam distortion within the fiber amplifier can be mitigated and we are able to generate at will any desired supported spatial mode guided in the fiber, including conventional linearly polarized (LP) modes, scalar OAM modes, and cylindrical vector modes, at average powers >10 W and with a peak power of >11 kW. Our results pave the way to the realization of practical high-power structured laser sources with tunable chirality and polarization.

ABSTRACT: Orbital angular momentum (OAM) holography gradually develops towards multi-dimension, large capacity, multi-degree of freedom and high complexity. Benefiting from the light field modulation mechanism in the radial space, a radially sub-region modulated OAM multiplexing holography is proposed to increase information capacity by using different diameters of radial annuluses (RA) or different radial gradient (RG) factors of vortex phase plate. The required image can be reconstructed by using corresponding inverse modulated phase distribution. Fully used the radial space increases the information capacity of OAM holography. Meanwhile, two proposed keys, namely the annulus radius and the radial topological charge gradient, enhance the encryption security of traditional OAM holography. The proposed method is able to combine with existed OAM holography for achieving complete full bandwidth multiplexing, which opens a new window for increasing the capacity of the information storage and communication.

ABSTRACT: High-power mode-programmable orbital angular momentum (OAM) beams have received substantial attention in recent years. They are widely used in optical communication, nonlinear frequency conversion, and laser processing. To overcome the power limitation of a single beam, coherent beam combining (CBC) of laser arrays is used. However, in specific CBC systems used to generate structured light with a complex wavefront, eliminating phase noise and realizing flexible phase modulation proved to be difficult challenges. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate a two-stage phase control method that can generate OAM beams with different topological charges from a CBC system. During the phase control process, the phase errors are preliminarily compensated by a deep-learning (DL) network, and further eliminated by an optimization algorithm. Moreover, by modulating the expected relative phase vector and cost function, all-electronic flexible programmable switching of the OAM mode is realized. Results indicate that the proposed method combines the characteristics of DL for undesired convergent phase avoidance and the advantages of the optimization algorithm for accuracy improvement, thereby ensuring the high mode purity of the generated OAM beams. This work could provide a valuable reference for future implementation of high-power, fast switchable structured light generation and manipulation. (C) 2020 Chinese Laser Press

ABSTRACT: "In recent years, parity-time (PT) symmetry in optoelectronic systems has been widely studied, due to its potential applications in lasers, sensors, topological networks, and other fields. In this paper, a time-division multiplexed pulsed optoelectronic oscillator (OEO) is proposed to study the dynamics of a PT symmetry system. Two microwave pulses are used to realize the PT symmetry in a single spatial resonator based on the temporal degrees of freedom. The gain and loss of the micro-wave pulses and the coupling coefficient between them can then be controlled. We first demonstrate the phase diagram from PT broken to PT symmetry in the OEO system. We theoretically prove that the perturbation of a coupling-induced phase shift larger than (2 pi) x 10(-2) causes the disappearance of the PT symmetry. In this experiment, the perturbation is less than (2 pi) x 0.5 x 10(-2)  thus, the phase transition of PT symmetry is observed. In addition, multipairs of PT-symmetry pulses indicate that pulsed OEO could be used to implement complex non-Hermitian Hamilton systems. Therefore, it is confirmed that pulsed OEO is an excellent platform to explore the dynamics of PT symmetry and other non-Hermitian Hamiltonian systems. (C) 2022 Chinese Laser Press"

ABSTRACT: "Since the invention of the laser in the 1960s, the higher power of the laser has led to a better understanding of the interaction between light and matter because of its monochromaticity, directionality, and coherence. Optical tweezers, which won the 2018 Nobel Prize in Physics, are one of the best applications of lasers. In 1976 ASHKIN A discovered that a single beam of light dependent on a gradient force could capture particles. The single beam optical tweezers is widely used in the biological field. In 1992, Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) was discovered, structural beams carrying OAM have been widely used in the field of particle manipulation and it adds the degree of freedom of lateral manipulation for optical tweezers and has more abundant manipulation modes. However, in the case of the existing structural beams, no matter how the structure of light is changed, due to the nature of OAM, its structure beam will always make particles move along a given orbit in specific applications. The real-time orbital movement of particles is not considered. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a beam with a more abundant mode than the previous single OAM , which can simultaneously exist a variety of different OAMs and control the motion of particles in real-time. The Hohmann transfer was derived by the German engineer Dr. Walter Hohmann in 1925. It is a method to transfer the minimum energy of a satellite between two circular orbits with the same inclination and different altitudes. It's widely used in the aerospace field. Although particles move in solution, they are also affected by buoyancy and other external forces in addition to the gravity of particles themselves, and the environment they live in is relatively complex, so their motion cannot be compared with the law of planetary motion. However, the orbital switching of Hohmann transfer can still solve the existing problems of structured optical tweezers. To solve this situation, in this paper, the corresponding orbit beam is generated by beam shaping technology, the orbit is transformed into an elliptical orbit by coordinate transformation technology, and finally, the orbit is combined by the Fourier phase shift theorem. A kind of Hohmann Transfer Structured Beam (HTSB) has been proposed via combining beam shaping technology, coordinate transformation technology and Fourier phase shift theorem. This beam has a very abundant mode of regulation and the phase gradient distribution can transfer the particles from the parking orbit to the synchronous orbit. Also, the size, structure, and phase gradient, can be arbitrarily adjusted, in the application can be based on the actual needs of the corresponding adjustment of the beam. Firstly, we analyze the relationship between each orbit of Hohmann transfer, and give the relationship between parameters corresponding to each orbit of HTSB, and the control method. The intensity and phase distribution of the HTSB with increasing radius are simulated. Secondly, we extend the HTSB according to the principle of Hohmann transfer, and discuss the parameter setting and generation method of HTSB with more orbits. The intensity and phase distribution of HTSB with more orbits are simulated. Finally, an optical tweezer experiment is set up, and the HTSB is used to manipulate the polystyrene particles. We have designed two experiments, the first experiment is using a fixed HTSB to make the particles from the parking orbit transfer to synchronous orbit, and the second experiment is using dynamic switch cover template on spatial light modulator particles in a week and a half after parking orbits respectively, choose an appropriate time to transfer orbit switch mask template, rotating again after a week and a half, Transfer to synchronous orbit and rotate once in synchronous orbit. Moreover, the beam can do a lot more. It can reverse the fixed orbit and the synchronous orbit by changing the topological charges  the velocity of particles moving between orbits can be controlled by adjusting the topological charge of each orbit  it can control the way the particles are transferred by rotating the beam as a whole. Therefore, this research proves the feasibility of Hohmann transfer in the microscopic field and has great significance in the field of optical micromanipulation."

ABSTRACT: We investigate a simple paraxial vector beam, which is a coaxial superposition of two single-ringed Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beams, linearly polarized along the horizontal axis, with topological charges (TC) n and -n, and of two LG beams, linearly polarized along the vertical axis, with the TCs m and -m. In the initial plane, such a vector beam has zero spin angular momentum (SAM). Upon propagation in free space, such a propagation-invariant beam has still zero SAM at several distances from the waist plane (initial plane). However, we show that at all other distances, the SAM becomes nonzero. The intensity distribution in the cross-section of such a beam has 2m (if m > n) lobes, the maxima of which reside on a circle of a certain radius. The SAM distribution has also several lobes, from 2m till 2(m + n), the centers of which reside on a circle with a radius smaller than that of the maximal-intensity circle. The SAM sign alternates differently: one lobe has a positive SAM, while two neighbor lobes on the circle have a negative SAM, or two neighbor pairs of lobes can have a positive and negative SAM. When passing through a plane with zero SAM, positive and negative SAM lobes are swapped. The maximal SAM value is achieved at a distance smaller than or equal to the Rayleigh distance.

ABSTRACT: There is growing interest in using ultrafast light pulses to drive functional materials into nonequilibrium states with novel properties. The conventional wisdom is that above-gap photoexcitation behaves similarly to raising the electronic temperature and lacks the desired selectivity in the final state. Here, we report a novel nonthermal lattice instability induced by ultrafast above-gap excitation in SnSe, a representative of the IV -VI class of semiconductors that provides a rich platform for tuning material functionality with ultrafast pulses due to their multiple lattice instabilities. The new lattice instability is accompanied by a drastic softening of the lowest-frequency Ag phonon. This mode has previously been identified as the soft mode in the thermally driven phase transition to a Cmcm structure. However, by a quantitative reconstruction of the atomic displacements from time-resolved x-ray diffraction for multiple Bragg peaks and excitation densities, we show that ultrafast photoexcitation with near-infrared (1.55 eV) light induces a distortion toward a different structure with Immm symmetry. The Immm structure of SnSe is an orthorhombic distortion of the rocksalt structure and does not occur in equilibrium. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the photoinduced Immm lattice instability arises from electron excitation from the Se 4p- and Sn 5s-derived bands deep below the Fermi level that cannot be excited thermally. The results have implications for optical control of the thermoelectric, ferroelectric, and topological properties of the monochalcogenides and related materials. More generally, the results emphasize the need for ultrafast structural probes to reveal distinct atomic-scale dynamics that are otherwise too subtle or invisible in conventional spectroscopies.

ABSTRACT: The transverse spin and orbital-to-spin angular momentum conversion during strong focusing of light beams have attracted wide interest due to the novel physics behind and their broad potential applications. In this work, we study the effect of incident beam's degree of polarization on the localized spin density of a tightly focused field. By modulating the correlation strength between two orthogonally polarized vortex modes of the incident beam, we find that the magnitude of the focal-plane transverse spin density component changes only slightly, while its spatial shape becomes an isotropic spin vortex with the decrease of the incident degree of polarization. Whereas, the longitudinal spin density, induced by the vortex phase, reduces its magnitude significantly with the decrease of incident beam's degree of polarization. The behavior of the focal-plane spin density is interpreted with the two-dimensional degrees of polarization among the tightly focused field components. Furthermore, we explore the roles of the topological charge on enhancing the longitudinal spin density for unpolarized incident beam. Our results reveal the feasibility of spin-orbit interaction with partially polarized or even completely unpolarized light, such as the thermal light.

ABSTRACT: A real-time interrogation technology for a large-scale fiber laser sensor array is proposed and experimentally investigated by employing a hybrid topological structure based on the wavelength-and frequency-division multiplexing techniques. In this system, a 2-D n x m sensor array is established by using a 1 x n coupler and n 1 x m couplers. All sensors are divided into n units by the 1 x n coupler. In each unit, there are m fiber-ring laser sensors with approximately the same wavelength and different beat frequencies due to different laser cavity lengths. Meanwhile, different units are characteristic of different operating wavelengths by splicing different fiber Bragg grating (FBG) as a reflector. Therefore, each sensor has a unique wavelength-and frequency-encoded information. All sensors can be interrogated by the combination of wavelength and frequency multiplexing technology. In the paper, a 4 x 4 sensor array is set up experimentally to verify the interrogation ability, and the sensing information of the strain and temperature has been successfully extracted. The experimental results show that the proposed interrogation system has the ability of real-time monitoring for a large-scale fiber laser sensor array.

ABSTRACT: The implementation of topological photonic systems at optical frequency is of great significance for practical applications. In this work, we extend the study of unidirectional transmission to the visible light range with a relatively simple structure. We theoretically demonstrated the existence of self-guiding one-way edge modes at the interface between air and a hexagonal lattice of rods with a layered plasmo-semiconductor-gyroelectric meta-material as the background medium. The inherent loss in metals can be compensated by the incorporation of the semiconductor layers with optical gain. Our simulation result shows that the self-guiding transmission remains 82% over a distance of about 30 wavelengths. In addition, it renders the light travel on such an interface insensitive to obstacles or impurities either on-purposely introduced or caused by manufacturing imperfections or variations. We show that the power transmission remains around 80% even in the presence of deliberately introduced obstacles. By exploiting the robust self-guiding unidirectional transport feature, we have designed a shape-independent cavity that can tolerate sharp corners in different angles, which eliminates the reflection and relaxes the geometrical constraint in design of integrated photonic devices.

ABSTRACT: The formation of an optical vortex by a silver spiral zone plate was presented by using the finite-difference time-domain method implemented in FullWVE (RSoft). Both the left and right circularly polarized Gaussian beams at the wavelength of 532 nm have been used as an incident light. Spiral zone plate with the topological charge of 2 mu m, the diameter of 8 mu m and the focal length of 532 nm made in 100 nm silver film produces an optical vortex with the maximum intensity of 55 a.u. at the focal plane.

ABSTRACT: In this manuscript, a method of generating an ultra-long optical needle (depth-to-width ratio 37.5:1) is proposed and demonstrated by focusing an azimuthally polarized beam. In theory, the action mechanism between the incident beam and the amplitude modulation element, the spiral phase modulation element, the focusing lens were studied based on the Richards and Wolf's theory. The relationship between the intensity distribution of the optical needle and the structure parameter of the element were obtained, thus leading to the complete design model and design standard. In experiment, the annular amplitude modulation element and spiral phase modulation element were fabricated by lithography. The optical needle was obtained based on a custom-designed optical setup in our laboratory. The optical system consists of an annular aperture (3.9-mm inner diameter, 80-mu m annular width), a spiral phase plate (topological charge of 1), and an objective lens with numerical aperture of 0.95. Finally, an optical needle with a subwavelength size (0.416 lambda) and an ultra-long depth of focus (15.6 lambda) was obtained, showing an excellent agreement with our theoretical model.

ABSTRACT: Arrays of atoms coupled to photons propagating in a waveguide are now actively studied due to their prospects for generation and detection of quantum light. Quantum simulators based on waveguides with long-range couplings were also predicted to manifest unusual many-body quantum states. However, quantum tomography for large arrays with N >= 20 atoms remains elusive since it requires independent access to every atom. Here, we present a novel concept for analog emulation of such systems by unveiling an analogy between the setup of waveguide quantum electrodynamics and the classical problem of an electromagnetic wave propagating in a wire metamaterial. Experimentally measuring near electromagnetic fields, we emulate the two-particle localization arising from polariton-polariton interactions in the quantum problem. Our results demonstrate the potential of wire metamaterials to visualize quantum light-matter coupling in a table-top experiment and may be applied to emulate other exotic quantum effects, such as quantum chaos, and self-induced topological states.

ABSTRACT: We have shown that a reverse energy flow (negative projection of the Poynting vector onto the optical axis) at the sharp focus of an optical vortex with topological charge 2 and left-hand circular polarization arises because the axial spin flow has a negative projection onto the optical axis and is greater in magnitude than positive projection onto the optical axis of the orbital energy flow (canonical energy flow). Also, using the Richards-Wolf formulas, it is shown that when focusing a left-handed circularly polarized light, in the region of the on-axis reverse energy flow, the light is right-handed circularly polarized.

ABSTRACT: Topological complex electromagnetic waves give access to nontrivial light-matter interactions and provide additional degrees of freedom for information transfer. An important example of such electromagnetic excitations are space-time non-separable single-cycle pulses of toroidal topology. Here we introduce an extended family of super-toroidal electromagnetic excitation, which exhibit skyrmionic structure of the electromagnetic fields, multiple singularities, and fractal-like energy backflow. By further introducing bandlimited effect into super-toroidal pulses, we show that space-time non-separable band-limited light fields can exhibit superoscillations simultaneously in the spatial and temporal domains, i.e. can oscillate faster that the highest harmonics of their spectra. The super-toroidal pulses with space-time superoscillation are of interest for transient light-matter interactions, ultrafast optics, spectroscopy, and toroidal electrodynamics.

ABSTRACT: "We present a novel experimental setup in which magnetic and optical tweezers are combined for torque and force transduction onto single filamentous molecules in a transverse configuration to allow simultaneous mechanical measurement and manipulation. Previously we have developed a super-resolution imaging module which, in conjunction with advanced imaging techniques such as Blinking assisted Localisation Microscopy (BaLM), achieves localisation precision of single fluorescent dye molecules bound to DNA of similar to 30 nm along the contour of the molecule  our work here describes developments in producing a system which combines tweezing and super-resolution fluorescence imaging. The instrument also features an acousto-optic deflector that temporally divides the laser beam to form multiple traps for high throughput statistics collection. Our motivation for developing the new tool is to enable direct observation of detailed molecular topological transformation and protein binding event localisation in a stretching/twisting mechanical assay that previously could hitherto only be deduced indirectly from the end-to-end length variation of DNA. Our approach is simple and robust enough for reproduction in the lab without the requirement of precise hardware engineering, yet is capable of unveiling the elastic and dynamic properties of filamentous molecules that have been hidden using traditional tools."

ABSTRACT: Orbital angular momentum (OAM) beams with topological charge l are commonly generated and detected by modulating an incoming field with an azimuthal phase profile of the form exp(il phi) by a variety of approaches. This results in unwanted radial modes and reduced power in the desired OAM mode. Here, we show how to enhance the modal purity in the creation and detection of classical OAM beams and in the quantum detection of OAM photons. Classically, we combine holographic and metasurface control to produce high purity OAM modes and show how to detect them with high efficiency, extending the demonstration to the quantum realm with spatial light modulators. We demonstrate ultra-high purity OAM modes in orders as high as l = 100 and a doubling of dimensionality in the quantum OAM spectrum from a spontaneous parametric downconversion source. Our work offers a simple route to increase the channel capacity in classical and quantum communication using OAM modes as a basis.

ABSTRACT: Polarization singularities, describing the points where the state of polarization is indeterminate, reveal the polarization topology in vectorial optical fields, which include two-/three-dimensional topologies such as C-points, V-points, L-lines, Mobius strips, links, and knots. Compared with the phase singularities, it has more parameters to manipulate, which bring forth a series of novel optical phenomena and potential applications. In this Perspective, the research progress and development of polarization singularities are reviewed from the mathematical description, generation, detection, propagation dynamics, and related applications. In particular, we focused on the three-dimensional spatial propagation and the topological characteristics of polarization singularities in detail and revealed some basic fundamental physical phenomena and the novel effects of polarization singularities. We aim to touch on the key research studies in this field and provide insight into the current status and the challenges to the research studies. Finally, we outline the exciting prospects for the future that are yet to be realized.

ABSTRACT: We demonstrate a novel way of synthesizing spin-orbit interactions in ultracold quantum gases, based on a single-photon optical clock transition coupling two long-lived electronic states of two-electron 173Yb atoms. By mapping the electronic states onto effective sites along a synthetic electronic dimension, we have engineered fermionic ladders with synthetic magnetic flux in an experimental configuration that has allowed us to achieve uniform fluxes on a lattice with minimal requirements and unprecedented tunability. We have detected the spin-orbit coupling with fiber-link-enhanced clock spectroscopy and directly measured the emergence of chiral edge currents, probing them as a function of the flux. These results open new directions for the investigation of topological states of matter with ultracold atomic gases.

ABSTRACT: We propose to use a femtosecond direct laser writing technique to realize dielectric optical elements from photo-resist materials for the generation of structured light from purely geometrical phase transformations. This is illustrated by the fabrication and characterization of spin-to-orbital optical angular momentum couplers generating optical vortices of topological charge from 1 to 20. In addition, the technique is scalable and allows obtaining microscopic to macroscopic flat optics. These results thus demonstrate that direct 3D photopolymerization technology qualifies for the realization of spin-controlled geometric phase optical elements.

ABSTRACT: This paper is devoted to the numerical investigation of the availability at cloud service systems. In this paper criteria and constraints calculations were performed and obtained results were analyzed for synthesis purposes of distributed service platforms based on the cloud service-oriented architecture such as availability and system performance index variations by defined set of the main parameters. The method of synthesis has been numerically generalized considering the type of service workload in statistical form by Hurst parameter application for each integrated service that requires implementation within the service delivery platform, which is synthesized by structural matching of virtual machines using combination of elementary servicing components up to functionality into a best-of-breed solution. As a result of restrictions from Amdahl's Law the necessity of cloud-networks clustering was shown, which makes it possible to break the complex dynamic network into separate segments that simplifies access to the resources of virtual machines and, in general, to the clouds and respectively simplifies complex topological structure, enhancing the overall system performance. In overall, proposed approaches and obtained results numerically justifying and algorithmically describing the process of structural and functional synthesis of efficient distributed service platforms, which under process of their configuring and exploitation provides an opportunity to act on the dynamic environment in terms of comprehensive services range and nomadic users' workload pulsing.

ABSTRACT: In recent years, optical vortex beams possessing orbital angular momentum have received much attention due to their potential for high-capacity optical communications. This capability arises from the unbounded topological charges of orbital angular momentum (OAM) that provide infinite freedoms for encoding information. The two most common approaches for generating vortex beams are through fork diffraction gratings and spiral phase plates. While realization of conventional spiral phase plate requires complicated 3D fabrication, the emerging field of metasurfaces has provided a planar and facile solution for generating vortex beams of arbitrary orbit angular momentum. Among various types of metasurfaces, the geometric phase metasurface has shown great potential for robust control of light-and spin-controlled wave propagation. Here, we realize a novel type of geometric metasurface fork grating that seamlessly combine the functionality of a metasurface phase plate for vortex-beam generation, and that of a linear phase gradient metasurface for controlling the wave-propagation direction. The metasurface fork grating is therefore capable of simultaneously controlling both the spin and the orbital angular momentum of light. [GRAPHICS] .

ABSTRACT: "Higher-order exceptional points (EPs), which appear as multifold degeneracies in the spectra of non-Hermitian systems, are garnering extensive attention in various multidisciplinary fields. However, constructing higher-order EPs still remains a challenge due to the strict requirement of the system symmetries. Here we demonstrate that higher-order EPs can be judiciously fabricated in parity-time (PT)-symmetric staggered rhombic lattices by introducing not only on-site gain/loss but also non-Hermitian couplings. Zero-energy flatbands persist and symmetry-protected third-order EPs (EP3s) arise in these systems owing to the non-Hermitian chiral/ sublattice symmetry, but distinct phase transitions and propagation dynamics occur. Specifically, the EP3 arises at the Brillouin zone (BZ) boundary in the presence of on-site gain/loss. The single-site excitations display an exponential power increase in the PT-broken phase. Meanwhile, a nearly flatband sustains when a small lattice perturbation is applied. For the lattices with non-Hermitian couplings, however, the EP3 appears at the BZ center. Quite remarkably, our analysis unveils a dynamical delocalization-localization transition for the excitation of the dispersive bands and a quartic power increase beyond the EP3. Our scheme provides a new platform toward the investigation of the higher-order EPs and can be further extended to the study of topological phase transitions or nonlinear processes associated with higher-order EPs.& COPY  2023 Chinese Laser Press"

ABSTRACT: The creation and manipulation of optical vortices, both in free space and in two-dimensional systems such as surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs), has attracted widespread attention in nano-optics due to their robust topological structure. Coupled with strong spatial confinement in the case of SPPs, these plasmonic vortices and their underlying orbital angular momentum (OAM) have promise in novel light-matter interactions on the nanoscale with applications ranging from on-chip particle manipulation to tailored control of plasmonic quasiparticles. Until now, predominantly integer OAM values have been investigated. Here, we measure and analyze the time evolution of fractional OAM SPPs using time-resolved two-photon photoemission electron microscopy and near-field optical microscopy. We experimentally show the field's complex rotational dynamics and observe the beating of integer OAM eigenmodes at fractional OAM excitations. With our ability to access the ultrafast time dynamics of the electric field, we can follow the buildup of the plasmonic fractional OAM during the interference of the converging surface plasmons. By adiabatically increasing the phase discontinuity at the excitation boundary, we track the total OAM, leading to plateaus around integer OAM values that arise from the interplay between intrinsic and extrinsic OAM.

ABSTRACT: Transition-metal dichalcogenides with their exciton-dominated optical behavior emerge as promising materials for realizing strong light-matter interactions in the visible range and at ambient conditions. When these materials are combined with metals, the energy confining ability of plasmon polaritons in metals below the diffraction limit allows for further enhancing and tailoring the light-matter interaction due to the formation of plexcitons in hybrid metal-TMDC structures at the interface. Herein, we demonstrate that the coupling between quasi-propagating plasmons in plasmonic crystals and excitons in WSe2 provides a multioscillator playground for tailoring the band structure of plasmonic crystal structures and results in emerging flat bands. The cathodoluminescence spectroscopy and angle-resolved measurements combined with the numerically calculated photonic band structure confirm a strong exciton-plasmon coupling, leading to significant changes in the band diagram of the hybrid lattice and the ability to tailor the band diagram via strong coupling. The hybrid plexcitonic crystal structures investigated here sustain optical waves with remarkably low group velocities. These results could be used for designing tunable slow-light structures based on the strong coupling effect and pave the way for plexcitonic topological photonic structures.

ABSTRACT: Vector Bessel beams may have a spatially varying polarization state combined with a Bessel-type transversal intensity profile. Such beams can carry both spin angular momentum and orbital angular momentum (OAM) and be characterized by points on higher-order Poincare (HOP) spheres. We report a method to produce vector Bessel beams on any point of a HOP sphere of any topological charge by utilizing only a single all-dielectric planar metasurface. Specifically, by a proper choice of the input polarization and distance from the metasurface, the entire HOP sphere surface can be covered. The proposed method is simple and efficient and applies to any nth-order HOP sphere. Furthermore, it yields an extremely high OAM mode purity. Our paper demonstrates a robust approach for generating arbitrary high-quality vector Bessel beams and will likely inspire future applications ranging from optical manipulation to laser beam engineering.

ABSTRACT: Optical lattices and Feshbach resonance management are two mighty and widely used techniques for studying, both experimentally and theoretically, various physical issues and the underlying nonlinear dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates. Both techniques show great power for studying solitons of different types, and particularly, the former technique realizes the creation of 1D bright matter-wave gap solitons, whose formation and properties in multidimensional systems, however, are much less known. Herein, both techniques and study are combined, theoretically and numerically, the formation and dynamics of 3D nonlinear localized gap modes, including fundamental gap solitons and their higher-order ones as soliton clusters, as well as gap vortices with topological charge s = 1. The stability regions of all the localized gap modes are identified by means of direct perturbed numerical simulations, revealing important insights into soliton physics in multidimensional space.

ABSTRACT: Metasurfaces provide an effective technology platform for manipulating electromagnetic waves, and the existing design methods all highlight the importance of creating a gradient in the output phase across light scattering units. However, in the emerging research subfield of meta-waveguides where a metasurface is driven by guided modes, this phase gradient-oriented approach can only provide a very limited emission aperture, significantly affecting the application potential of such meta-waveguides. In this work, we propose a new design approach that exploits the difference between meta-atoms in their light scattering amplitude. By balancing this amplitude gradient in the meta-atoms against the intensity decay in the energy-feeding waveguide, a large effective aperture can be obtained. Based on this new design approach, three different wavefront shaping functionalities are numeri-cally demonstrated here on multiple devices in the terahertz regime. They include beam expanders that radiate a plane wave, where the beam width can increase by more than 900 times as compared to the guided wave. They also include a metalens that generates a Bessel-beam focus with a width 0.59 times the wavelength, and vortex beam generators that emit light with a tunable topological charge that can reach -30. This amplitude gradient design approach could benefit a variety of off-chip light shaping applications such as remote sensing and 6G wireless communications.

ABSTRACT: The advent of topological semimetals with peculiar band structure and exotic transport provides an unprecedented material platform that allows exploring novel optoelectronics for circumventing technological bottlenecks. Cd3As2, a three-dimensional Dirac semimetal, represents a hallmark system for studying nontrivial quantum phenomena led by Dirac/Weyl physics. However, controllable growth and device implementation are still in their infancy due to lack of efficient ways to make use of light-induced effects in semimetals. In this study, highly sensitive, low-energy photodetection up to terahertz (THz) band wavelength along with fast response at room temperature has been implemented in an antenna-assisted Cd3As2 planar structure, which is derived from molecular-beam epitaxial growth. It is demonstrated that the THz photodetector based on semimetal Cd3As2 films possesses a responsivity of 0.04 A/W and a NEP value of 430 pW/Hz(1/2). Nonequilibrium manipulation of Dirac fermions with thickness-controlled gap phases and an electromagnetic-coupling effect has been well exploited. Our results portray opportunities for developing high-performance, scalable low-energy photodetectors enabled by a Dirac semimetal, which is promising for broadband photoresponses in the highly pursued THz band.

ABSTRACT: "Orbital angular momentum of light (OAM) is attracting increasing attention in conjunction with the continuing development of high-speed optical communications. The unlimited nature of OAM allows its multiple degrees of freedom to be used in communications applications. In the OAM multiplexing technique, different OAMs provide independent channels to carry and deliver different data. An OAM multiplexing scheme in the terahertz (THz) band based on use of a single-layer metasurface is demonstrated numerically and experimentally in this work. The designed structure generates four focused phase vortex beams that have different topological charges under illumination by a Gaussian beam, which means that OAM multiplexing with four channels is realized. When an individual vortex beam is used as the incident light, only one channel is identified and extracted as a focal spot  that is, demultiplexing of the OAM signal is achieved. The structure has subwavelength-level thickness, which enriches the number of potential approaches available for the miniaturization and integration of THz communication systems. The performance of the designed OAM multiplexing and demultiplexing device shows excellent agreement between the theoretical predictions and experimental results, thus indicating that this device is suitable for ultrahigh-speed THz communications."

ABSTRACT: In this paper, the problem of automatic determination of the position and measuring the thickness of the human skin layers in high-frequency ultrasound images (HFUS) is solved. Location and the process of position determination of the skin layers are not an obvious process due to the phenomenological nature of the images received in HFUS, the so-called speckle noise and the lack of the objective measures. In order to determine the positions of the boundaries of the skin layers, the image analysis methods were used, based on the specific features of the HFUS images, such as layered structure and echogenicity features. Only the fusion of the results of the analysis algorithms based on global (histogram of intensity levels) and local image features (cross-sectional and topological characteristics) improves discriminative features applicable to complete the information about the properties of the HFUS images with layered structure and to develop a method assessing the thickness of the skin layers. The knowledge gathered from such layers checks can improve understanding of the nature of the human skin and provide a more objective conditions for HFUS diagnostic imaging with speeding up the diagnostic process for dermatologists. We proposed a new method for automatic segmentation on HFUS images using fusion of discriminative information based on nonlinear segmentation with a reasonable threshold setting, boundary selecting and linking, and false boundary point removing strategies for intensity distributions.

ABSTRACT: We found that the surface relief grating direction (SRG) made the nematic liquid crystal (LC) align along the grating direction. The SRGs were photo-fabricated on a liquid crystalline azobenzene side-chain, polymer film by the conventional holographic method, The twisted nematic liquid crystal (TNLC) cell was prepared using two SRG substrates or two rubbed polyimide substrates as alignment layers, and the LC alignment was investigated by measuring the transmittance of a 90degrees-TNLC cell located between crossed polarizers. The LC aligning process was studied. in-situ using the hybrid LC cell with the rubbed polyimide substrate and the SRG substrate as the reference and the test alignment layers, respectively. The in-situ transmission data show that the topological effect by the SRG formation and the intermolecular interaction effect by the azo chromophore alignment compete with each other.

ABSTRACT: Photons possess spin degree of freedom, which plays an important role in various applications such as optical communications, information processing and sensing. In isotropic media, photon spin is aligned with the propagation direction of light, obeying the principle of spin momentum locking. Interestingly, surface waves decaying away from an interface have a photon spin transverse to its propagation, opening exciting opportunities for the observation of spin-dependent excitation in confined systems. Here, we propose and realize transverse photon spin (T-spin) in a bulk medium, without relying on the presence of any interfaces. We show the mapping of the T-spin of surface modes to that of the bulk modes by introducing bianisotropy into the medium. We further discover that the interface between two bianisotropic media of opposite orientations supports edge-dependent propagating modes with tunable cutoff frequencies. Our results provide a new platform for manipulating the spin-orbit interaction of electromagnetic waves.

ABSTRACT: We theoretically, numerically, and experimentally investigate new types of laser beams with autofocusing, rotating and/or transformation properties. A spatial light modulator generates these laser beams as clusters/sets of shifted vortex Laguerre-Gaussian beams and their superpositions with additional phase distribution. We demonstrate the formation of the clusters of rotating beams with controlled individual autofocusing trajectories as well as different transformations (topological/positional and interference redistribution) and rotation of the entire clusters as complex structures. Moreover, we investigate the possibility of astigmatic transformation of the propagating laser beams clusters. Thus, the proposed techniques provide additional control of the three-dimensional trajectories of the structured laser beams with predetermined intensity and phase distributions and can be used in laser manipulation, laser material processing, and optical microscopy.

ABSTRACT: The relationship between magnetoelectricity and electromagnetism is a subject of a strong interest and numerous discussions in microwave and optical wave physics and material sciences. The definition of the energy and momentum of the electromagnetic (EM) field in a magnetoelectric (ME) medium is not a trivial problem. The question of whether electromagnetism and magnetoelectricity can coexist without an extension of Maxwell's theory arises when the effects of EM energy propagation are studied and the group velocity of the waves in an ME medium is considered. The energy balance equation reveals unusual topological structure of fields in ME materials. Together with certain constraints on the constitutive parameters of a medium, definite constraints on the local field structure should be imposed. Analyzing the EM phenomena inside an ME material, the question what kind of the near fields arising from a sample of such a material can be measured? should be answered. The visualization of the ME states requires an experimental technique that is based on an effective coupling to the violation of spatial as well as temporal inversion symmetry. To observe the ME energy in a subwavelength region, it is necessary to assume the existence of first-principle near fields-the ME fields. These are non-Maxwellian near fields with specific properties of violation of spatial and temporal inversion symmetry. A particular interest to the ME fields arises in studies of metamaterials with artificial-atoms ME elements.

ABSTRACT: "Metamaterial absorbers, composed of artificial unit cells, have been widely investigated in the past few decades due to their unique performance of low profile, low cost, lightweight, and customized absorption responses, etc. The principles of the metamaterial absorber to absorb incoming electromagnetic waves lie in the impedance matching between the metamaterial absorber and free space (120 pi). This paper reviews the developments of the metamaterial absorbers, from narrow to wide band, single- to dual-polarization, polarization-sensitive to polarization-insensitive, small- to wide-angle absorption. The topologies and solutions to achieve wideband, dual-polarized, polarization-insensitive, wide-angle absorption metamaterial absorbers are clarified and discussed from the antenna reciprocity and equivalent circuit viewpoints. One of the applications of metamaterial absorbers is to reduce the scattering effects of a metal object by coating the metamaterial absorbers on the metal object. With the appearance of the band-notched metamaterial absorber and hybrid architecture, metamaterial absorbers can be readily integrated and co-designed with antennas to improve antennas' performance. This paper also presents the applications of the metamaterial absorbers on antennas from topological analysis to practical implementations. Two topologies to achieve low scattering antennas are described in detail. One is utilizing the notch band of a band-notched metamaterial absorber as the metal ground for an antenna (planar patch antenna, dipole antenna, or monopole antenna)  within the notch band, the antenna can radiate efficiently, while the band-notched metamaterial absorbers can absorb incoming electromagnetic waves to reduce the scattering effects significantly out of the notch band. The other is using hybrid architecture to design reflectarray antennas with gain filtering and low scattering effects by proposing a unit cell with simultaneous phase shift and electromagnetic wave absorption properties. The manipulations of the phase shift and electromagnetic wave absorption are independent of each other to facilitate the design of the reflectarray antennas. The future perspectives on metamaterial absorbers are discussed finally."

ABSTRACT: The connections between Laguerre-Gauss and Bessel-Gauss beams, and between Hermite-Gauss and cosine-Gauss beams are investigated. We review different asymptotic expressions for generalized Laguerre and Hermite polynomials of large radial/transverse order. The amplitude variations of generalized Laguerre-Gauss beams, including standard and elegant Laguerre-Gauss beams as special cases, are compared with Bessel-Gauss beams. Bessel-Gauss beams can be well-approximated by elegant Laguerre-Gauss beams. For non-integral values of the Laguerre function radial order, a generalized Laguerre-Gauss beam with integer order matches the width of the central lobe well, even for low radial orders. Previous approximations are found to be inaccurate for large azimuthal mode number (topolgical charge), and an improved approximation for this case is also introduced.

ABSTRACT: The broad application of hyperspectral devices makes hyperspectral image target detection a popular research. This paper presents a new method for target detection by transforming the hyperspectral data into complex networks. By analyzing the networks topological feature corresponding to each pixel, one can easily evaluate the statistical characteristics and intrinsic properties of the signals. Thereby matching the target by comparing the pixel network characteristics. The spectral characteristics of the pixel are analyzed from the perspective of the network, which provides a new spectral matching criterion. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can acquire satisfactory results when compared with traditional methods.

ABSTRACT: An all-optically reconfigurable generation of optical vortices would be highly beneficial to the implementation of next-generation optical communication and advanced information processing. The previously demonstrated approaches based on the parametric nonlinear optical processes, however, have exhibited limited conversion efficiency due to the group velocity mismatch and nonlinear phase shifts, and require the cumbersome preparation of either the optical element or initial seed beam having a non-zero topological charge. Here, we propose and analyze a novel scheme for highly efficient all-optical generation and control of optical vortices based on the dynamic acoustic vortex grating created by forward stimulated intermodal Brillouin scattering in a subwavelength-hole photonic waveguide. The dual-frequency pump beams in two different hybrid optical modes drive an acoustic vortex mode, which transforms a signal in the fundamental optical mode into an optical vortex mode. This scheme not only eliminates the need for the initial preparation of an angular-momentum-carrying medium or an optical vortex seed but also guarantees high modal purity and nearly 100% conversion efficiency assisted by the energy-momentum conservation. We also investigate the feasibility and practicability of the subwavelength-hole waveguides by examining the intermodal conversion efficiency and robustness of guidance of the optical vortices, taking into account the impact of the Kerr-type nonlinear effects on the intermodal Brillouin interactions based on our rigorous full-vectorial analytical theory.

ABSTRACT: Hepatobiliary and renal excretions are the two major in vivo elimination pathways, of which prediction is particularly important for the optimization of systemic and/or target-site exposure of new near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent contrast agents. To characterize the physicochemical descriptors associated with each clearance route, a compound library containing more than 760 NIR fluorophores is analyzed and systematically reviewed in this study. Although there are a host of biochemical and physiological mechanisms that ultimately determine the in vivo fate of any given molecule, the physicochemical properties of contrast agents including molecular weight, hydrophobicity, topological polar surface area, molecular charges, and hydrogen/rotatable bonds are often indicative of each clearance route. The approach developed is anticipated to be useful in early lead identification studies when selecting NIR fluorescent contrast agents from large database screenings. It may also be applied to prioritize synthetically feasible chemical modifications during lead compound optimization.

ABSTRACT: In this work, a quasi-nondispersive and spin-decoupled phase modulation strategy was proposed based on the chiral structure. Owing to the spin-dependent response of the chiral structure, the evolution of the Aharonov-Anandan (AA) geometric phase can be controlled by tuning different structural parameters independently. Additionally, the chiral structure was designed nonresonant or weak-resonant to minimize the influence of strong resonant absorption and large dispersive propagation phase shift, leading to an efficiently quasi-nondispersive phase modulation. To prove the validity of the strategy, a series of umbrella-shaped reflection-type metal-insulator-metal structures were designed as the unit cells and simulated with the finite element method. Moreover, the metasurfaces were designed based on such unit cells to generate broadband orbital angular momentums with different topological charges and spin-switchable holograms, respectively. Simulated and experimental results are in good agreement with the theoretical results. To the best of our knowledge, broadband spin-dependent phase modulation has been achieved without intentionally merging other types of phases for the first time in this work. We believe that this strategy provides a flexible approach for complex spin- or polarization-related applications in optical communication, integrated optics, optical sensing, and other related fields.

ABSTRACT: Chirality is a structural property of molecules lacking mirror symmetry that has strong implications in diverse fields, ranging from life sciences to materials science. Chirality-sensitive spectroscopic methods, such as circular dichroism, exhibit weak signal contributions on an achiral background. Helical dichroism, which is based on the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light, offers a new approach to probe molecular chirality, but it has never been demonstrated on disordered samples. Furthermore, in the optical domain the challenge lies in the need to transfer the OAM of the photon to an electron that is localized on an angstrom-size orbital. Here we overcome this challenge using hard X-rays with spiral Fresnel zone plates, which can induce an OAM. We present the helical dichroism spectra of a disordered powder sample of enantiopure salts of the molecular complex of [Fe(4,4 '-diMebpy)(3)](2+) at the iron K edge (7.1 keV) with OAM-carrying beams. The asymmetry ratios for the helical dichroism spectra are within one to five percent for OAM beams with topological charges of one and three. These results open a new window into the studies of molecular chirality and its interaction with the OAM of light. Linearly polarized orbital angular momentum-carrying hard X-ray beams are induced using spiral Fresnel zone plates. By sending the hard X-ray beams to disordered enantiopure molecular complexes, the helicity-dependent and chiral-sensitive signal is obtained.

ABSTRACT: Spin angular momentum, an elementary dynamical property of classical electromagnetic fields, plays an important role in spin-orbit and light-matter interactions, especially in near-field optics. The research on optical spins has led to the discovery of phenomena such as optical spin-momentum locking and photonic topological quasiparticles, as well as applications in high-precision detection and nanometrology. Here, we investigate spin-momentum relations in paraxial optical systems and show that the optical spin angular momentum contains transverse and longitudinal spin components simultaneously. The transverse spin originates from inhomogeneities of field and governed by the vorticity of the kinetic momentum density, whereas the longitudinal spin parallel to the local canonical momentum is proportional to the polarization ellipticity of light. Moreover, the skyrmion-like spin textures arise from the optical transverse spin can be observed in paraxial beams, and their topologies are maintained free from the influence of the Gouy phase during propagation. Interestingly, the optical singularities, including both phase and polarization singularities, can also affect the spin-momentum properties significantly. Our findings describe the intrinsic spin-momentum properties in paraxial optical systems and apply in the analysis of the properties of spin-momentum in optical focusing, imaging, and scattering systems.

ABSTRACT: Light that carries spatiotemporal orbital angular momentum (ST-OAM) makes possible new types of optical vortices arising from transverse OAM. ST-OAM pulses exhibit novel properties during propagation, transmission, refraction, diffraction, and nonlinear conversion, attracting growing experimental and theoretical interest and studies. However, one major challenge is the lack of a simple and straightforward method for characterizing ultrafast ST-OAM pulses. Using spatially resolved spectral interferometry, we demonstrate a simple, stationary, single-frame method to quantitatively characterize ultrashort light pulses carrying ST-OAM. Using our method, the presence of an ST-OAM pulse, including its main characteristics such as topological charge numbers and OAM helicity, can be identified easily from the unique and unambiguous features directly seen on the raw data-without any need for a full analysis of the data. After processing and reconstructions, other exquisite features, including pulse dispersion and beam divergence, can also be fully characterized. Our fast characterization method allows high-throughput and quick feedback during the generation and optical alignment processes of ST-OAM pulses. It is straightforward to extend our method to single-shot measurement by using a high-speed camera that matches the pulse repetition rate. This new method can help advance the field of spatially and temporally structured light and its applications in advanced metrologies.

ABSTRACT: Light beams carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) in the form of optical vortices have attracted great interest due to their capability for providing a new dimension and approach to manipulate light-matter interactions. Recently, plasmonics has offered efficient ways to focus vortex beams beyond the diffraction limit. However, unlike in the visible and near-infrared regime, it is still a big challenge to realize plasmonic vortices at far-infrared and even longer wavelengths. An effective strategy to create deep-subwavelength near-field electromagnetic (EM) vortices operating in the low frequency region is proposed. Taking advantage of the asymmetric spatial distribution of EM field supported by a metallic comb-shaped waveguide, plasmonic vortex modes that are strongly confined in a well-designed deep-subwavelength meta-particle with desired topological charges can be excited. Such unique phenomena are confirmed by the microwave experiments. An equivalent physical model backed up by the numerical simulations is performed to reveal the underlying mechanism of the plasmonic vortex generation. This spoof-plasmon assisted focusing of EM waves with OAM may find potentials for functional integrated elements and devices operating in the microwave, terahertz, and even far-infrared regions.

ABSTRACT: "Pursuing higher topological charge-larger angular indices m of high-order Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beams-is not only important for frontier applications like optical/quantum communication, optical tweezers, and super-resolution imaging, but also involves a novel laser cavity and beam dynamics. Active methods to directly generate high-order-mode vortex beams from a laser cavity have excellent power handling and conversion efficiency, but struggle to achieve hundred-level ultra-high-order LG modes. Here, the generation of ultra-high-order LG beams with m beyond 300 is demonstrated, utilizing the spherical aberration of a lens in the cavity of a simple end-pumped Nd:YVO4 laser at 1064 nm. LG(0,& PLUSMN )(m) modes with m up to 317, selectable across a large range, are generated. With a simple model, how the mode selection relates to the cavity parameters is explained, and it is predicted that even higher order mode output can be expected by appropriate management of the elements' aperture and laser gain. The approach provides a simple and flexible method to convert a wide range of lasers to generate ultra-high-order LG modes."

ABSTRACT: Engineering of the spatial distribution of currents in a semiconductor is demonstrated using vectorial arrangement of optical fields, enabling an ultrafast magnetic field source. The increasingly prominent role of light in information processing makes optoelectronic devices a technology of fundamental importance. Coherent control of currents in semiconductors using synthesized optical waveforms provides a sensitive and robust means to transfer information from light to an electronic circuit. Currents driven by Gaussian laser beams are spatially uniform in direction, offering limited technological utility. Full control over the transverse spatial distribution of currents excited in a material would vastly increase the versatility and impact of optoelectronic devices. Here we simultaneously control the waveform and vectorial arrangement of optical fields, enabling precise manipulation of the spatial distribution of currents in a semiconductor. As a direct application, we drive loop currents, embodying a new ultrafast magnetic field source. Subsequently, we demonstrate a scheme for generating an arbitrary superposition of two orthogonal current arrangements via subcycle adjustment of the optical waveform.

ABSTRACT: Artificial periodic structures (APS) with controllable optical properties are highly demanded in all-optical devices and circuits in communication networks. However, APS realized in solid materials are usually non-tunable and inherently possess immutable photonic bandgap. In this article, a novel honeycomb lattice in an atomic ensemble by utilizing the multi-beam interference method is reported. Unlike the honeycomb lattice formed in solid materials, the optical properties of this photoinduced honeycomb lattice, such as the absorption/dispersion coefficients and the photonic bandgap can be efficiently tuned by two-photon detuning and Rabi frequency, resulting in both amplitude- and phase- type honeycomb lattice. Based on the two-photon quantum-imaging method, the near-field diffraction of the honeycomb lattice is also investigated. It is found that the resolution of the diffraction pattern is tunable by simply adjusting the manner of the two detectors scanning across the imaging beams. In addition, the contrast of the pattern can be greatly enhanced by tuning the optical properties of the lattice. Such an optical honeycomb lattice with tunable properties could find applications in all-optical switching at the few photons level and paves the way for the generation and manipulation of optical topological insulators.

ABSTRACT: Optical vortices, which have been extensively studied over the last decades, offer an additional degree of freedom useful in many applications, such as optical tweezers and quantum control. Stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS), providing a narrow linewidth and a strong nonlinear response, has been used to realize quasi-continuous wave lasers. Here, stable oscillation of optical vortices and acoustic modes in a Brillouin laser based on chiral photonic crystal fiber (PCF) is reported, which robustly supports helical Bloch modes (HBMs) that carry circularly polarized optical vortex and display circular birefringence. A narrow-linewidth Brillouin fiber laser that stably emits 1st- and 2nd-order vortex-carrying HBMs is implemented. Angular momentum conservation selection rules dictate that pump and backward Brillouin signals have opposite topological charge and spin. Additionally, it is shown that when the chiral PCF is placed within a laser ring cavity, the linewidth-narrowing associated with lasing permits the peak of the Brillouin gain that corresponds to acoustic mode to be measured with resolution of 10 kHz and accuracy of 520 kHz. The results pave the way to a new generation of vortex-carrying SBS systems with applications in optical tweezers, quantum information processing, and vortex-carrying nonreciprocal systems.

ABSTRACT: Intense femtosecond optical vortices with spatially structured amplitude and spiral phase front give rise to novel phenomena in light-matter interactions and strong-field physics. However, current femtosecond vortex sources exhibit a poor power handling capability and amplification remains an open challenge due to a number of inherent technical difficulties. Here, it is demonstrated that a single-crystal fiber laser amplifier is particularly well-suited to directly amplify a femtosecond optical vortex without pulse stretching and compression in the time domain, while still maintaining the spatial properties associated with a clear central singularity and a spiral phase front, i.e., a well-defined amount of orbital angular momentum (OAM).The optical nonlinearity experienced by such twisted light is verified to be substantially weaker compared to a fundamental mode beam where supercontinuum generation and spatial distortion are observed. The simple design and straightforward power scaling capability pave the way toward ultrahigh-intensity femtosecond singular laser sources with an arbitrary topological charge. Such ultrafast OAM light sources are expected to help reveal complex physical phenomena in light-matter interactions and expand the applications to attoscience with X-ray vortices, laser plasma acceleration, and micromachining.

ABSTRACT: Significunee A series of new physical mechanisms and unique optoelectronic properties in nanostructures provide the possibility to explore and study new optoelectronic chips. Progress Photons and phonons are important information carriers. Precise measurement of photons and phonons in micro-/nano- periodic structures allows the detection of multi-dimensional physical information and various physical quantities. Here, by manipulation of photons with metasurface units, a one-shot miniaturized ultraspectral camera with thousands of micro-spectrometers on a CMOS image sensor chip is proposed and applied to realize real-time onchip spectral imaging. Micro-spectrometers with high center-wavelength accuracy of 0.1 nm and spectral resolution of 0.8 nm are realized and the ultraspectral imaging results for a plate of fruits just under the lighting of a fluorescent lamp are obtained. For phonons, opto-mechanical crystals are studied by dealing with the interaction between photons (light) and phonons (mechanical motion). A hetero opto-mechanical crystal is proposed and demonstrated by integrating two types of periodic structures into the system, and the optical and mechanical modes can be confined separately. This separate confinement gives rise to phonon lasing with a high mechanical frequency of 6. 22 GHz. Moreover, radiation-pressure-antidamping enhanced opto-mechanical spring sensing based on a silicon nano-beam opto-mechanical structure is proposed and demonstrated, which allows for sensing resolution of similar to 10(-7). Some interesting phenomena and novel devices are arising by free electrons interacting with various nanostructures. We demonstrate the first on-chip integrated free electron light source by greatly reducing electron energy to 0.25-1. 4 keV for generating Cherenkov radiation (CR). In hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) with hyperbolic phonon polaritons, the theoretical and simulated results reveal that CR can be generated using free electrons with an extremely low kinetic energy of 1 eV, which is about two-orders of magnitude lower than that in multilayer plasmonic hyperbolic metamaterial. For generating Smith-Purcell radiation (SPR) in the deep UV region, we let an electron beam pass through a grating with 30 nm-wide slots and observe the SPR with the shortest wavelength of 230 nm and the broadband SPR with wavelengths covering 230-1100 nm. We numerically investigate the SPASER excited by free electrons, and the tunable, deep-ultraviolet laser with output power density reaching about 30 W/mu m(2) and wavelength widely tuned by varying the electron energy. Our work opens up the possibility of exploring high performance on-chip integrated free electron light sources and optoelectronic devices, and provides a way for realizing an integrated free electron laser. Introduced by Allen in 1992, orbital angular momentum (OAM) was characterized as a new freedom of lightwave. Since then, it has been attracted much research interest and shown the potential for various applications. Compared with the bulk optics, photonic integrated devices are much more compact and, the most importantly, compatible with the matured CMOS fabrication process. Since 2012, we has proposed and demonstrated integrated OAM emitters, plasmonic vortex arrays, angular momentum beam splitters and sorters, as well as the methods to identify the topological charges carried by OAM beams, etc. Here, three representative works are shown. Firstly, beams carrying OAM generated on chips are proposed for wireless optical interconnects and an integrated OAM emitter with a wide switching range of OAM modes is demonstrated. The independence of the micro-ring cavity and the gratings unit provides the flexibility to design the device and optimize the performances. Second, we propose an integrable method for generating vortex Smith-Purcell radiation by letting free electrons pass on holographic gratings and the numerical results indicate that the OAM wave with different topological charges can be obtained. Third, an angular momentum (AM) beam splitter has been demonstrated so that both spin and orbital components carried by lightwave can be distinguished simultaneously. Photons are ideal flying qubits. Photonics provides an important way to develop quantum information technologies. A quantum information system based on photonics includes functional units for quantum state generation, manipulation, and detection. How to integrate these functions on a photonic chip is a crucial technology for future quantum information applications. We have taken part in the research of integrated quantum photonic circuits since 2010. In these ten years, we have developed comprehensive solutions on integrated quantum light sources for various quantum entangled state generation at telecom bands, based on spontaneous four-wave-mixing in silicon waveguides and micro-ring resonators. We have also developed technologies for quantum state manipulation and detection on a silicon photonic chip. Utilizing high-performance energy-time entangled photon pairs generated in silicon waveguides, we have proposed and demonstrated a scheme of temporal ghost imaging based on the frequency correlation in the photon pairs, and have developed a quantum secure ghost imaging scheme based on it. Recently, we have realized a fully connected quantum key distribution (QKD) network with 40 users and 780 QKD links based on a silicon photonic quantum light source. It is the entanglement-based QKD network with the largest user number to the knowledge of authors. Conclusion and Prospect In summary, the research achievements of our research group in the field of nanostructured optoelectronic chips are reviewed. Various nanostructures have been successfully developed to control the mechanism of photons, electrons, phonons, surface plasmon polariton and their interactions, and a series of new functional optoelectronic chips have been realized, such as free electron radiation, real-time spectral imaging, phonon sensing, optical orbital angular momentum radiation, and quantum state generation and control. At present, some of the chips are being industrialized and expected to become practical in the near future.

ABSTRACT: Studies of topological semimetals have revealed spectacular transport phenomena spanning extreme magnetoresistance effects and ultrahigh mobilities. As phonon dynamics and electron-phonon scattering play a critical role in the electrical and thermal transport, we pursue a fundamental understanding of these effects in type-I Weyl semimetals NbAs and TaAs. In the temperature-dependent Raman spectra of NbAs we reveal a previously unreported Fano line shape, a signature stemming from the electron-phonon interaction. Additionally, the temperature dependence of the A(1) phonon linewidths in both NbAs and TaAs strongly deviate from the standard model of anharmonic decay. To capture the mechanisms responsible for the observed Fano asymmetry and the atypical phonon linewidth, we present first-principles calculations of the phonon self-energy correction due to the electron-phonon interaction. Through this study of the phonon dynamics and electron-phonon interaction in these Weyl semimetals, we consider specific microscopic pathways which could contribute to the nature of their macroscopic transport.

ABSTRACT: One of concepts giving opportunities for studying of topological insulators in non-magnetic materials, or creating scattering-immune in optical waveguides is creation of synthetic gauge fields in photonic systems. It was shown that gauge fields shift the band-gaps of optical waves, which can be applied to implement one-way nonreciprocal waveguides, even though both the waveguide core and cladding are in a topologically trivial state [1]. In our work we propose a method to create a gauge field in a synthetic photonic mesh lattice - an optical device proved its high versatility for optical experiments [2]. We demonstrate presence of localized modes due to nontrivial gauge field circulation.

ABSTRACT: In the field of optics, bound state in the continuum (BIC) as a special state to be researched in many photonic crystals and periodic structures, which can produce strong resonance and an ultrahigh Q factor. Some designs of narrowband transmission filters, lasers, and sensors are proposed based on excellent optical properties of quasi-BIC. In this paper, we consider symmetrical rectangular grating structure firstly. Then cut off a corner of rectangular gratings, the Fano line of quasi-BIC can be observed in the spectrum. After that, we change the oblique parameter of the other rectangular grating, which can further decrease the Fano line width. In the momentum space, the change of structure means topological charges split from q = 1 into half charges q = 1/2. We analyze guided mode resonance (GMR) excitation of the grating structure, and discuss the dispersion relations in the waveguide layer with the position of BIC in energy bands. In addition, the spectrum exhibits asymmetric line-shapes with different values of the asymmetry parameters, M-1 and M-2. BIC is transformed into quasi-BIC as the symmetry of the structure broken. Thus, a large Goos-Hanchen shift can be achieved as a result of ultrahigh Q factor of quasi-BIC. This work demonstrates a double trapezoid structure with strong resonance properties, which has significant implications for exploring the phenomenon of BIC.

ABSTRACT: Perfect vortex beam has the characteristics of optical orbital angular momentum and is widely studied because of its advantages of a uniform ring profile and fixed radius. However, the current method of generating perfect vortex beam is mainly based on the phase modulation of spatial light modulator. We have proposed and demonstrated the fabrication of polymer-based phase plate to generate the first and higher-order perfect vortex beams by using maskless lithography exposure technique. According to the relationship of the lithographic depth of polymer and grayscale exposure, the phase plates with different topological charges and axicon parameters are fabricated. By using such polymer-based phase plate, the radius and ring width of perfect vortex beams are analyzed theoretically and experimentally. The fabricated phase plate shows high transmittance as well as perfect vortex beam generation with high quality in the bandwidth range from 1460 nm to 1640 nm. The obtained results prove the feasibility of the attempt of polymer to generate perfect vortex beams, showing great potential in the application of highly miniaturized and integrated optical vortex applications.

ABSTRACT: In optical communications, it is desirable to know some quantities describing a light field, that conserve on propagation or resist to distortions. Typically, vortex beams are characterized by their orbital angular momentum (OAM) and topological charge (TC). Here, we show that the OAM of a single rotationally symmetric optical vortex is not affected by an arbitrary-shape aperture. For superposition of several optical vortices, we study what happens with its OAM behind a sector aperture. We discover that a specific sector angle does not violate the OAM carried by the superposition. The aperture half-angle should be equal ton multiplied by an integer number and divided by the greatest common divisor of all possible differences between the TCs. We show that such a sector aperture also conserves the orthogonality between the complex amplitudes of the constituent vortex beams. This property allows their effective demultiplexing after being distorted by such an aperture. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: We study the dispersion relation of a metamaterial composed of metallic disks and bars arranged to have kagome symmetry and find that a plasmonic flat band is formed by the topological nature of the kagome lattice. To confirm the flat-band formation, we fabricate the metamaterial and make transmission measurements in the terahertz regime. Two bands formed by transmission minima that depend on the polarization of the incident terahertz beams are observed. One of the bands corresponds to the flat band, as confirmed by the fact that the resonant frequency is almost independent of the incident angle.

ABSTRACT: The propagation of laser beams having orbital angular momenta (OAM) in the turbulent atmosphere is studied numerically. The variance of random wandering of these beams is investigated with the use of the Monte Carlo technique. It is found that, among various types of vortex laser beams, such as the Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beam, modified Bessel-Gaussian beam, and hypergeometric Gaussian beam, having identical initial effective radii and OAM, the LG beam occupying the largest effective volume in space is the most stable one.

ABSTRACT: The concept of gauge fields plays a significant role in many areas of physics, from particle physics and cosmology to condensed-matter systems, where gauge potentials are a natural consequence of electromagnetic fields acting on charged particles and are of central importance in topological states of matter(1). Here, we report on the experimental realization of a synthetic non-Abelian gauge field for photons(2) in a honeycomb microcavity lattice(3). We show that the effective magnetic field associated with transverse electric-transverse magnetic splitting has the symmetry of the Dresselhaus spin-orbit interaction around Dirac points in the dispersion, and can be regarded as an SU(2) gauge field(4). The symmetry of the field is revealed in the optical spin Hall effect, where, under resonant excitation of the Dirac points, precession of the photon pseudospin around the field direction leads to the formation of two spin domains. Furthermore, we observe that the Dresselhaus-type field changes its sign in the same Dirac valley on switching from s to p bands, in good agreement with the tight-binding modelling. Our work demonstrating a non-Abelian gauge field for light on the microscale paves the way towards manipulation of photons via spin on a chip. A spin-orbit coupling effect in photonic graphene made of coupled polaritonic microcavities is experimentally realized, revealing the unique fine structure of the eigenstates around the Dirac points, with the formation of a Dresselhaus-like effective magnetic field that can be mapped to a non-Abelian gauge field.

ABSTRACT: A concise, efficient, and practical direct-view scheme is presented to generate arbitrary cylindrical vector (CV) beams, including CV beams, vortex beams, and cylindrical vector vortex (CVV) beams, by a vortex half-wave plate (VHP). Six kinds of first-order and other high-order CV beams, such as azimuthally polarized (AP) beams, anti-vortex radial polarization mode beams, and three-order AP beams, are formed by simply rotating a half-wave plate. The Stokes parameters and double-slit interference of multitype CV beams are investigated in detail. The polarization parameters, including degree of polarization, polarization azimuth, and ellipticity, are obtained, which demonstrates the efficient generation of CV beams. In addition, the double-slit interference experiment is introduced in the setup, and fringe misplacement and tilt appear for CVV beams, in which the misplacement number M is 2P + 1 for P <= 2 and 2P - 1 for P >= 3, where P is the polarization order number, and the fringe tilt offset is positively related to the topological charge number l of CVV beams. In addition, new types of VHPs can be formed by cascading two or more VHPs when the types of available VHPs are limited, assisting in more flexible generation of multitype CV beams. It is experimentally demonstrated that arbitrary CV beams with high quality are effectively achieved by the proposed setup, and the double-slit interference method can be utilized to determine and analyze CV beams rapidly and concisely by practical performance, which shows the potential to be implemented as a commercial device.

ABSTRACT: The orbital angular momentum (OAM) spatial degree of freedom of light has been widely explored in many applications, including telecommunications, quantum information, and light-based micromanipulation. The ability to separate and distinguish between the different transverse spatial modes is called mode sorting or mode demultiplexing, and it is essential to recover the encoded information in such applications. An ideal d mode sorter should be able to faithfully distinguish between the different d spatial modes, with minimal losses, and have d outputs and fast response times. All previous mode sorters rely on bulk optical elements, such as spatial light modulators, which cannot be quickly tuned and have additional losses if they are to be integrated with optical fiber systems. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate, to the best of our knowledge, the first all-in-fiber method for OAM mode sorting with ultrafast dynamic reconfigurability. Our scheme first decomposes the OAM mode in-fiber-optical linearly polarized (LP) modes and then interferometrically recombines them to determine the topological charge, thus correctly sorting the OAM mode. In addition, our setup can also be used to perform ultrafast routing of the OAM modes. These results show a novel and fiber-integrated form of optical spatial mode sorting that can be readily used for many new applications in classical and quantum information processing.

ABSTRACT: Exciton polariton condensation is a macroscopic quantum state that can be efficiently controlled by an external field through a nonlinear interaction. In an annular potential landscape, a rotational polariton flow with different orbit indexes can be created spontaneously. Control of their superposition states with symmetry broken is of fundamental interest for exotic quantum states. By adopting the nonresonant ring-shaped pumping in a planar perovskite microcavity, we demonstrate the linear coupled counter-rotating polariton states with ordered phase changes and a vortex pairs-petal state at the condensed threshold. The azimuthal indices and inherent flowing velocity can be well controlled by the diameter of the pumping ring and the detuning energy. At high pump density, the petal state becomes unstable and a single vortex generates, indicating the role of the polariton-polariton interaction and exciton depletion in controlling the superposition of the rotational polariton flow. Broken cylindrical symmetry is realized by a pumping ring with radial slots and the consequent dark soliton. An additional phase jump and fractional orbit index of polariton rotation can thus be obtained. Our results suggest the efficient all-optical control of rotational polariton flow and their superposition states with a flexible diameter and a broken cylindrical symmetry at room temperature, which is promising for practical polaritonic circular current-based applications with topological and chiral properties.

ABSTRACT: In the framework of the Richards-Wolf formalism, the spin-orbit conversion upon tight focusing of an optical vortex with circular polarization is studied. We obtain exact formulas which show what part of the total (averaged over the beam cross-section) longitudinal spin angular momentum is transferred to the total longitudinal orbital angular momentum in the focus. It is shown that the maximum part of the total longitudinal angular momentum that can be transformed into the total longitudinal orbital angular momentum is equal to half the beam power, and this maximum is reached at the maximum numerical aperture equal to one. We prove that the part of the spin angular momentum that transforms into the orbital angular momentum does not depend on the optical vortex topological charge. It is also shown that by virtue of spin-orbital conversion upon focusing, the total longitudinal energy flux decreases and partially transforms into the whole transversal (azimuthal) energy flow in the focus. Moreover, the longitudinal energy flux decreases by exactly the same amount that the total longitudinal spin angular momentum decreases.

ABSTRACT: The collective response of a system is profoundly shaped by the interaction dynamics between its constituent elements. In physics, tailoring these interactions can enable the observation of unusual phenomena that are otherwise inaccessible in standard settings, ranging from the possibility of a Kramer's degeneracy even in the absence of spin to the breakdown of the bulk-boundary correspondence. Here, we show how tailored asymmetric coupling terms can be realized in photonic integrated platforms by exploiting non-Hermitian concepts. In this regard, we introduce a generalized photonic molecule composed of a pair of microring resonators with internal S-bends connected via two directional couplers and a link waveguide. By judiciously designing the parameters of this system, namely, the length of the links and the power division ratio of the directional couplers, we experimentally show the emergence of Hermitian and non-Hermitian-type exchange interactions. The ramifications of such coupling dynamics are then studied in 1D chain and ring-type active lattices. Our findings establish the proposed structure as a promising building block for the realization of a variety of phenomena, especially those associated with phase locking in laser arrays and non-Hermitian topological lattices.

ABSTRACT: We investigate the generation of higher-order optical vector solitons in two transverse dimensions in anisotropic nonlinear media consisting of an incoherent superposition of a Gaussian beam and a higher-order laser mode with a complex internal modal structure. We demonstrate both, numerically and experimentally various examples of these stable self-trapped light structures and show that vortex modes carrying topological charge always decay into multiple-humped structures which remain self-trapped during propagation. Furthermore we combine two dipole mode beams in the absence of a fundamental Gaussian component and demonstrate their mutual attraction that displays an unstable propagation behaviour and leads to a splitting of one constituent beam.

ABSTRACT: Optical metasurfaces are becoming ubiquitous optical components to control light properties. However, most of these devices are passive and cannot be arbitrarily reconfigured according to the change in the surrounding environment. Here the authors propose an innovative design strategy relying on the position of topological singularities to address full phase modulation of light with almost unity efficiency. The active metasurface unit cells consist of asymmetric Gires-Tournois resonators filled with either silicon or hetero-structured materials to leverage on the thermo-optical or electro-optical effects, respectively. In both cases, a full phase modulation associated with 100% reflection amplitude is observed even when dealing with extremely low refractive index change, on the order of 0.01. Improving the deflection efficiencies for each deflection angle is performed by optimizing the refractive index modulation profile in the extended unit cell using an advanced statistical learning optimization methodology. Consequently, active beam steering designs for active thermo-optical effect with ultimate performance exceeding 90% have been optimized. Furthermore, active wavefront splitting using electro-optics materials is optimized to reach ultimate modulation performances with nearly 92% efficiency. The realization of highly efficient active beam-forming operating at high frequencies would open important applications in imaging microscopy, and 3D light detection and ranging (LiDAR).

ABSTRACT: "Taking advantage of multimaterial additive manufacturing, this work demonstrates a kind of polarization-maintaining metasurface (MS) for spin-decoupled beam shaping. The wavefronts of the two spin states, i.e., the left-hand circular polarization (LHCP) and the right-hand circular polarization (RHCP), can be independently manipulated while the output spin state remains the same as the input. The meta-atom is implemented with dual-polarized antennas at the top and the bottom with phase delay lines connecting them. The dual-polarized antenna on the receiving side is fixed to receive the LHCP/RHCP incident waves, while the dual-polarized transmitting antenna is rotated, providing the opposite phase shifts for the LHCP and RHCP. The absolute value of the phase shift is the same as the transmitting antenna's rotation angle. Meanwhile, varying the length of phase delay lines introduces 2 & pi  phase shifts for both LHCP and RHCP inputs. Thus, combining the two phase-shifting degrees of freedom, the LHCP and RHCP wavefronts can be independently controlled while the polarization is not flipped after transmitting through the MS. One MS produces vortex beams with different topological charges for LHCP and RHCP. The other achieves spin-decoupled focusing. The multilayered MSs are conveniently printed using multimaterial additive manufacturing without postprocessing."

ABSTRACT: Femtosecond light pulses carrying optical angular momentums (OAMs), possessing intriguing properties of helical phase fronts and ultrafast temporal profiles, enable many applications in nonlinear optics, strong-field physics, and laser micromachining. While generation of OAM-carrying ultrafast pulses and their interactions with matters are intensively studied in experiments, 3D characterization of ultrafast OAM-carrying light beams in spatiotemporal domain has, however, proved difficult to achieve. Conventional measurement schemes rely on the use of a reference pulsed light beam, which needs to be well characterized in its phase front and to have sufficient overlap and coherence with the beam under test, largely limiting practical applications of these schemes. Here a self-referencing set-up is demonstrated based on a tilted interferometer that can be used to measure complete spatiotemporal information of OAM-carrying femtosecond pulses with different topological charges. Through scanning one interferometer arm, the spectral phase over the pulse spatial profile can be obtained using the tilted interference signal, and the temporal envelope of the light field at one particular position around its phase singularity can be retrieved simultaneously, enabling 3D beam reconstruction. This self-referencing technique, capable of measuring spatiotemporal ultrafast optical-vortex beams, may find many applications in fields of nonlinear optics and light-matter interactions.

ABSTRACT: In the recent decade, the rotational Doppler effect has garnered considerable attention for stimulating the development of applications such as rotational Doppler velocity and topological charge measurements. Previous studies performed measurements under sources with one or multiple amplitude, phase, and polarization modulations. However, the applicability of these schemes is limited by the crucial factor of alignment between the source and object, especially if the magnitude of the source is greater than the object size. Therefore, this study proposes a partially coherent angular velocity measurement model that allows the rotational axes of targets to deviate from the source center and is even less susceptible to external jitters. Accordingly, a proof-of-principle experiment to determine the angular velocity under arbitrary alignment conditions is conducted. Tracing the rotational motion by rotating the coherent structure of the source results in a frequency shift-red shift for the same rotation and blue shift for a reverse rotation. The angular velocity vectors (both magnitude and direction) of two anisotropic sub-Rayleigh objects are successfully measured with ultrahigh precision. The lowest angular velocity is 0.001 r s(-1). The average relative error is less than 0.05% with sufficient sampling. Thus, the present findings can be applied to velocity metrology and micromanipulation.

ABSTRACT: The utilization of orbital angular momentum (OAM) as an independent degree of freedom for information encryption has gained significant attention. Nevertheless, the multiplexing capacity of OAM is still constrained, and there is a lack of research on accelerated decryption techniques in OAM multiplexed holography. In this study, ellipse-like orbital angular momentum (EL-OAM) multiplexed holography is proposed and implemented. The ellipse-like (EL) beam incorporates three modulatable parameters: topological charge, power index, and radial shift. To achieve efficient decryption, a composite ellipse-like lens (CELL) is introduced that generates two EL beams carrying different OAMs at distinct axial positions, resulting in two reconstruction holographic images with approximately equal intensity. The mode selectivity of EL-OAM based on the aforementioned parameters is investigated. Experimental verification demonstrates the feasibility of EL-OAM multiplexed holography and its potential for fast decryption in various dimensions. This breakthrough opens up new possibilities for practical information encryption and decryption systems. Ellipse-like orbital angular momentum and multiplexed holography utilizing an ellipse-like beam with three adjustable parameters is proposed and implemented. To enhance decryption efficiency, a composite ellipse-like lens, capable of generating two ellipse-like beams with different orbital angular momenta at separate axial positions, is introduced, thereby yielding two reconstruction holographic images of roughly equal intensity.image

ABSTRACT: Terahertz (THz) isolators are crucial to one-way transmission in THz application systems. However, it is still challenging to implement THz isolators with integrated structure and tunable characteristics. Herein, a THz isolator based on a magneto-plasmonic waveguide (MPWG) has been demonstrated. In this InSb-air-metal asymmetric waveguide, the plasmonic band gap is excited and thermally tuned by surface plasmons. Moreover, under weak external magnetic fields (EMFs), magneto-plasmons excite nonreciprocal transverse edge spin states, which break the time-reversal symmetry of the MPWG and lead to a pair of isolation bandgaps that only allow one-way transmission. The experimental results of both broadband time-domain spectrum system and single-frequency system confirm this isolator can achieve more than 20 dB isolation and only 4 dB insertion loss. More importantly, its isolation can be actively modulated by EMFs from 0 to 0.23 T, and also realize broadband tuning of over 1 THz frequency range by controlling the temperature from 80 to 280 K. This topological edge band structure of transverse spin states and its active manipulation mechanism are helpful to deepen the understanding of nonreciprocal plasmon propagation, and this broadband tunable THz on-chip isolator is significant to urgently apply in strong THz sources and ultra-sensitive detectors.

ABSTRACT: Structured beams of light are used to engineer conduction band populations and pattern currents. Using the approach, dynamic optoelectronic interconnects and other applications are demonstrated. Dynamic control over the conduction band electrons of a semiconductor is a central technological pursuit. Beyond electronic circuitry, flexible control over the spatial and temporal character of semiconductor currents enables precise spatiotemporal structuring of magnetic fields. Despite their importance in science and technology, the control of magnetic fields at the micrometre spatial scale and femtosecond temporal scale using conventional electromagnets remains challenging. Here, we apply structured light beams to interfering photoexcitation pathways in gallium arsenide to sculpt the spatial and momentum configuration of its conduction band population. Programmable control over several hundred micrometre-scale current elements is achieved by manipulating the wavefronts of an optical beam using a spatial light modulator, enabling vast flexibility in the excited current patterns. Using this platform, we demonstrate dynamic optoelectronic interconnects, circuits for spatially tailored magnetic fields and magnetic field lattices.

ABSTRACT: Existing searches for cosmic axions relics have relied heavily on the axion being nonrelativistic and making up dark matter. However, light axions can be copiously produced in the early Universe and remain relativistic today, thereby constituting a Cosmic axion Background (CaB). As prototypical examples of axion sources, we consider thermal production, dark-matter decay, parametric resonance, and topological defect decay. Each of these has a characteristic frequency spectrum that can be searched for in axion direct detection experiments. We focus on the axion-photon coupling and study the sensitivity of current and future versions of ADMX, HAYSTAC, DMRadio, and ABRACADABRA to a CaB, finding that the data collected in search of dark matter can be repurposed to detect axion energy densities well below limits set by measurements of the energy budget of the Universe. In this way, direct detection of relativistic relics offers a powerful new opportunity to learn about the early Universe and, potentially, discover the axion.

ABSTRACT: "The structure of a new eudialyte-group mineral sergevanite has been investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and electron probe microanalysis. The parameters of an elementary trigonal cell of the mineral are found to be a = 14.2179(1) angstrom, c = 30.3492(3) angstrom, and V = 5313.1(7) angstrom(3)  sp. gr. R3. The crystal structure is refined to the final reliability factor R = 2.74% in the anisotropic approximation of atomic displacements using 4870 reflections with F > 3 sigma(F). The idealized formula of the mineral (Z = 3) is (Na12KH3O)[Ca-3(Mn2Ca)](Na2Fe)Zr3Ti0.5Si25.5O72OH2 center dot(H2O)(2). The approaches to study the structural features of eudialyte-group minerals are discussed. In the structures of these minerals, the complex composition is ordered over statistically occupied sites in correspondence with the crystallochemical properties of atoms (ions) and formation conditions, both thermodynamic (temperature and pressure) and kinetic (process rate and duration). This information is absent for disordered topological structures with mixed unsplit sites."

ABSTRACT: Reconfigurable diffractive lenses manufactured in liquid crystal are presented. The lenses show an unprecedented performance in terms of active diameter and focal distance range when compared to any other transparent adaptive lens. The lenses are characterized by an active area free of electronic components, with a fill factor of 98% which combined with a low operating voltage (<10V(rms)), open for applications ranging from eye contact lenses to space applications. The addressing of the liquid crystal is done exclusively from the periphery of the device. The lenses are based on tunable spiral diffractive lenses (SDL) for which the focal length may be changed by changing the topological charge, i.e. twist of the spiral in the lens. The twist in the resulting wavefront is eliminated by cascading two spiral plates with opposite twists emulating a conventional diffractive lens. The presented lenses have a tuning range from -2 to +2 diopters and an active diameter of 25mm.

ABSTRACT: Using two identical microobjectives with a numerical aperture NA = 0.95, we experimentally demonstrate that the on-axis intensity near the tight focal spot of an optical vortex with a topological charge 2 is zero for right-handed circular polarization and nonzero for left-handed circular polarization. This serves to confirm that in the latter case there is a reverse energy flow on the optical axis, as testified by a very weak local maximum (the Arago spot) detected at the center of the measured energy flow distribution, caused by diffraction of the direct energy flow by a 300 nm circle (the diameter of a reverse energy flow tube). The comparison of numerical and experimental intensity distributions shows that it is possible to determine the diameter of the reverse energy flow tube, which is equal to the distance between the adjacent intensity nulls. For NA = 0.95 and a 532 nm incident wavelength, the diameter of the on-axis reverse energy flow tube is measured to be 300 nm. It is also experimentally shown that when an optical beam with second-order cylindrical polarization is focused with a lens with NA = 0.95, there is a circularly symmetric energy flow in the focus with a very weak maximum in the center (the Arago spot), whose distribution is determined by diffraction of the direct energy flow by a 300 nm circular region, where the energy flow is reverse. This also confirms that in this case, there is a reverse energy flow on the optical axis.

ABSTRACT: "We propose in this paper to deal with the notion of medical image registration : both physicians and surgeons need in the patient room or in the operation theater images of the medical target to reach and treat  these images can be very precise and come from a pre-operative acquisition device (NMR, CT-scanner,...) or from a per-operative set of sensors (active or passive infra-red sensors, laser acquisition, numerical 2D X rays, 3D echography,..). The main problem is then how to compare these multi-modal images having different resolutions and extracting different features (anatomic or functional) from the patient medical reality? In a first Section, we present the hard side with essentially optical sensing methods  after, in a second Section, we present an example of matching algorithm built in order to compare and super-impose pre- and per-operative images. This algorithm computes a confinement tree thanks to the watershed lines and we explain under which conditions the confinement tree can be an invariant parameter of the image for some topological transformations. We propose a simplification algorithm for this tree. Then, for two topologically closed images, for which the simplified trees are the same, we show how to match it, and how it is possible to consider those two matched trees as an initial condition for matching the remaining nodes of the initial trees. Then, a spline interpolation can be used in order to obtain the continuous transformation from the first image to the second one, using very few hypotheses. Finally, we describe several medical actions or surgical operations for which a physician or a surgeon needs such registration tools."

ABSTRACT: Unprecedented advances in machine learning have led to a variety of algorithms for the remote evaluation of biomedical images, allowing for cost-effective early detection of diseases. In particular, a lot of efforts are focused on the development of reliable image analysis tools for the early diagnosis of eye diseases. Here we present several new methods for ophthalmic image analysis. We propose a machine learning algorithm for ordering images of the anterior chamber (optical coherence tomography, OCT), which extracts features that discriminate between healthy subjects and patients with angle-closure. We also present an algorithm to detect the OCT images that contain artifacts, and we show that removing these images from the data base improves the performance of the ordering algorithm. Finally, we present algorithms for the analysis of retina fundus images, which are able to segment the vessel network in the retina and extract features from the topological tree-like network structure. We show that these features discriminate between healthy subjects and those with glaucoma or diabetic retinopathy.

ABSTRACT: The characteristics of high-power vortex Bessel beams in the terahertz range ( lambda = 141 mu m) obtained with the use of diffractive axicons (DAs) illuminated by a Gaussian beam of the Novosibirsk free-electron laser were studied. Two of the three possible types of DA recently described in our previous paper, namely, binary spiral silicon axicons (BAs), forming beams with a topological charge l equal to 0-4 and 9, and a diamond holographic axicon (HA), forming a beam with l = 9, were used in the experiments. These axicons formed beams whose cross sections in the region of inner Bessel rings were close to those of ideal Bessel beams, but their intensities varied in azimuth with a frequency of l and 2l for the BAs and HA, respectively. However, in the case of the BAs, the beams had a pronounced helical structure at the periphery, whereas for the HA, the beam was axisymmetric. By focusing these beams with a lens, we studied the structure of the so-called perfect beams (PBs). While an ideal Bessel beam exhibits a PB as a thin ring, in the case of the BAs, we observed a broadened ring structure consisting of 2l short spirals, and for the HA, we observed a narrow ring with 2l maxima in azimuth. A comparison of the numerical calculations and experiments showed that the observed azimuthal intensity variations can be attributed to inaccuracies in the preparation of the axicon relief and/or discrepancies between the calculated and actual wavelengths, within a few percent. The results of this work enable the establishment of quality requirements for axicon manufacture and the appropriate selection of the axicon type in accordance with the requirements for the beam.

ABSTRACT: We investigated the geometric structures, vibrational modes, and electronic structures of models of capped (5, 5) carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with four types of defects, namely, V1, V2, V3, and V4, using density functional theory. We found that the defects cause red shifts of the highest peak in infrared (IR) spectra and the highest peak, radial mode, and breathing mode in Raman spectra. There are two IR-active modes localized at V3 and V4 defects. In contrast, the influence of the defects on the electronic structures is considerably case-dependent, with the case of V2 being very special, involving spin polarization and showing a localized feature. The defects cause energy gap change as large as 0.1 eV. By analyzing the density of states of the capped (5, 5) CNT and its four defective structures, we found that at around -7 eV there is a characteristic peak belonging to the pure CNT that could be useful for defect detections. Our results are helpful for understanding the defect effects on the properties of general single-walled CNTs.

ABSTRACT: The phase function of optical fields collapse on focusing regions generating a discontinuity in the amplitude function, this induces sources or sinks that corresponds with the topological charge. When the previous comments are transferred to the Plasmon optics context, the discontinuity of the electromagnetic field generates a real distribution of electric charge. This distribution has associated a geometry which can be obtained from the boundary condition of the field. A dynamical character can be implemented on the charge distribution using partial coherence processes in the illumination configuration for the synthesis of the Plasmon field, generating local current distributions modifying selectively the electromagnetic field properties. The model is performed using as a prototype the interaction between plasmon fields Pearcey and Airy kind. Both of them have associated a catastrophe function to the phase function, this mathematical representation allows us to identify and quantify the discontinuity of the electromagnetic field. The computational simulations show that the charge/current distributions present non-linear effects, which offers applications for tunable spectroscopy, plasmonic tweezers, etc.

ABSTRACT: Optical vortices with the embedded wavefront singularities have attracted intensive attentions in many branches of modern physics, due to their important applications in optical tweezers, quantum entangles, optical testing, atmospheric propagations, etc. In this paper, optical vortices are generated by new types of custom designed wavefronts and their propagation in free-space is reported. Huygens-Fresnel diffraction integral is directly solved using the Gauss-Legendre quadrature method to estimate the diffraction pattern at some arbitrary plane. The variation of vorticity is demonstrated under diffraction. Evolution of phase singularities in wavefronts as the wavefront propagate is predicted for various near field distances. Simulations reveal that the exchange of the nature of topological charge occurs at a finite distance. Experimentally, the wavefronts have been generated using the phase-only spatial light modulator and their far-field diffraction patterns are recorded.

ABSTRACT: Optical activity is conventionally understood as a natural difference in the optical responses of chiral materials with opposite handedness. It stems from the quantised spin angular momentum +/-(h) over bar per photon, with the +/- representing either left- or right-handed circular polarisations. Less well known, until recently, was the possibility that matter might also respond in a similar, discriminatory way to the handedness of twisted light, or 'optical vortices, whose orbital angular momentum (OAM) is quantised as l (h) over bar per photon, where is the topological charge whose sign determines a wavefront twist to the left or right. Initial studies focusing on whether, in spectroscopic applications, chiral matter might respond differently to the vortex handedness of l (h) over bar and -l beams, failed to identify any viable mechanism. However, in the last few years, theory and experiment have both supplied ample evidence that, under certain conditions, such forms of interaction do exist-and as a result, the field of chirality and optical OAM is beginning to flourish at a pace. This topical review presents a survey of this new field, working up from a description of those initial studies to the cutting-edge experiments now taking place. Analysing the fundamental mechanisms provides for a revision of previous precepts, broadening their scope in the light of recent advances in understanding, and highlighting a vibrant synergy between the fields of optical activity and twisted light.

ABSTRACT:  LASER PHYSICS AND PHOTONICS XVI  AND COMPUTATIONAL BIOPHYSICS" This paper is devoted to the analysis of topological changes in complex networks that are reflected in the macroscopic characteristics. We consider a model of the complex network with the adaptive links, in which the synchronous dynamics leads to the appearance of clusters of strongly coupled elements and show that structural changes significantly affect the macroscopic dynamics. As the result, we demonstrate a high possibility of cluster formation in the network that can be analyzed via the consideration of macroscopic characteristics. We also discuss a prospective application for the detection of structural features of neural networks.

ABSTRACT: In this work, we investigate the use of a picosecond (ps) laser used for monolithic connection to texture three commercially available and frequently used multicomponent glasses, Corning EAGLE XG (R), Schott BOROFLOAT (R) 33 and Saint-Gobain SGG DIAMANT (R). The results show that the ablated crater profile and degree of texturing are glass composition dependent. This might be attributed to the different laser-induced electron collision times and recombination rates, and thus the critical electron density evolution leading to ablation. The surface texture is altered from periodic to random with decreasing scribing speed. The transmission of the textured substrates gradually decreases, whereas the multireflection on the surface increases as a consequence of the topological and morphological changes. The angular resolved measurements illustrate that the textured glass substrates scatter the light toward greater angles, which is necessary to increase the effective optical path in the absorber layer. Simulation results show that textured glass increases the absorption in the absorber material and the slightly modified refractive index region around the crater does not counteract the light in-coupling effect. The results suggest that these substrates can be used in various photovoltaic technologies and show potential for the application of alternative front contacts, such as carbon nanotubes.

ABSTRACT: The explicit expression of orbital angular momentum (OAM) spiral spectrum of Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beam propagating in anisotropic plasma turbulence is derived based on Rytov theory. The relationship between the detection probability of OAM and the crosstalk with the anisotropy parameters, topological charge, radial index, wavelength, beam width, receiving aperture, inner and outer scales are discussed in detail. In order to quantify the effect of plasma turbulence, we compared it with atmospheric turbulence based on restriction function. To optimize OAM detection probability, we also compared the effects of circular aperture method (CAM) with focusing mirror method (FMM) on the propagation characteristics of the spiral spectrum. The results show that even in the strong turbulence region of atmospheric turbulence, the radial dimension of LG beam in plasma turbulence is nearly twice that of atmospheric turbulence and the modes crosstalk has almost reached its upper bound. Besides, by comparing the two optimization methods, we found the ability to reduce crosstalk is related to the choice of beam width and receiving aperture. Therefore, we give a method to optimally select between the CAM and the FMM. We found the corresponding relationship and gave an analytical formula. The FMM has a greater ability to reduce crosstalk than the CAM when the beam width >= 4 cm and the aperture >= 3 cm. We quantified the effect of plasma turbulence and provide a guideline for the selection of beam width and receiving aperture under these two optimization methods. The research results may be helpful in the field of optical communication.

ABSTRACT: Fe3GeTe2 has emerged as one of the most fascinating van der Waals crystals due to its 2D itinerant ferromagnetism, topological nodal lines, and Kondo lattice behavior. However, lattice dynamics, chirality of phonons, and spin-phonon coupling in this material, which set the foundation for these exotic phenomena, have remained unexplored. Here, the first experimental investigation of the phonons and mutual interactions between spin and lattice degrees of freedom in few-layer Fe3GeTe2 is reported. The results elucidate three prominent Raman modes at room temperature: two A(1g)(Gamma) and one E-2g(Gamma) phonons. The doubly degenerate E-2g(Gamma) mode reverses the helicity of incident photons, indicating the pseudoangular momentum and chirality. Through analysis of temperature-dependent phonon energies and lifetimes, which strongly diverge from the anharmonic model below Curie temperature, the spin-phonon coupling in Fe3GeTe2 is determined. Such interaction between lattice oscillations and spin significantly enhances the Raman susceptibility, allowing to observe two additional Raman modes at the cryogenic temperature range. In addition, laser radiation-induced degradation of Fe3GeTe2 in ambient conditions and the corresponding Raman fingerprint is revealed. The results provide the first experimental analysis of phonons in this novel 2D itinerant ferromagnet and their applicability for further fundamental studies and application development.

ABSTRACT: Toroidal dipole has attracted tremendous attentions in nuclear, particle, condensed matter and material physics due to its exotic characteristics that are distinct from the fundamental electric and magnetic dipoles. Due to the very weak intensity, toroidal dipolar response is extremely difficult to be detected in natural materials. Although single dynamic toroidal dipole has recently been observed in metamaterials, simultaneous observation of multiple toroidal dipole resonances is still very challenging, and many intriguing physical phenomena associated with them have remained elusive. Here we experimentally demonstrate an approach to achieving toroidal dipole responses with high quality factors in the infrared region via surface-plasmon-polariton excitation. Implementation of this concept leads to simultaneous experimental observation of double toroidal modes in 3D metamaterial. Periodicity and angle dependent transmission measurements clearly reveal the coupling between the surface-plasmon-polariton mode and toroidal modes. Our demonstration provides a unique platform for the study of toroidal electrodynamics and various astonishing optical phenomena involving toroidal moments.

ABSTRACT: Photonic crystals can prevent or allow light of certain frequencies to propagate in distinct directions in anomalous and useful ways for use as waveguides, laser cavities, and topological light propagation. However, there exist limited approaches for fundamental reconfiguration of photonic crystals, such as changing the unit cell to various and on-demand geometries and symmetries. This work introduces the concept of pixelated 2D photonic crystals where the variability of the dielectric profile is achieved by a pixelated matrix of the material. Specifically, the cross sections of dielectric cylindrical pillars distributed in a photonic crystal lattice are replaced with pixelated circles using different resolutions and the corresponding band diagrams are calculated. The comparison to the band diagrams of the original structure shows that the original-and today typically used-cylindrical design can be well approximated by as few as 5x5$5 \times 5$ square switchable pixels while retaining less than 1%$$ change in the photonic band structure. Experimental realization of switchable pixelation is proposed based on the liquid crystal display (LCD) technology with high birefringence materials. More generally, the demonstrated approach to reconfigurable 2D photonic crystal based on switchable pixels can enable realization of diverse fundamentally reconfigurable advanced optical materials.

ABSTRACT: We propose a Watt-level, all-fiber, ultrafast Er/Yb-codoped double-clad fiber laser mode-locked by reduced graphene oxide (rGO) interacting with photonic crystal fiber (PCF) ultraweakly. The rGO solution is filled into the cladding holes of PCF, and after evaporation, the rGO flakes, contributing saturable absorption and high nonlinearity, interact with a light intensity of only 1/107 of that in the center of PCF. This ultraweakly interacting structure can enhance the thermal damage threshold and decrease the accumulated nonlinearity, which is proved to be an excellent choice for high-power mode-locked laser. By incorporating the saturable absorber into an Er/Yb-codoped fiber ring cavity, stable soliton laser with femtosecond duration is generated, and harmonic mode-locking is formed when increasing pump strength. The maximum average power of 1.14 W is obtained. To the best of our knowledge, this report is the highest power obtained directly from an all-fiber, graphene-mode-locked laser system operating with fundamental transverse mode. In addition, the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed structure is effective in generating high-power pulses when some other materials are used, including but not limited to graphene oxide, carbon nanotubes, topological insulator, or metal nanoparticles.

ABSTRACT: "A lossless slab excited by an E-polarized twodimensional (2-D) complex source point (CSP) beam is studied analytically. Such a source, unlike a Gaussian beam, satisfies exactly the Helmholtz equation and radiation condition, without paraxial approximation or formulation incompleteness. The guided-waves fields as well as the scattered fields in the regions above and below the slab are determined  in turn, the corresponding powers are directly calculated. Numerical results on the variations of these quantities with respect to the slab electrical thickness, the beam angle of incidence, the source aperture size and location are presented. Substantial power transfer from the finite directive source into each of the slab's guided waves is recorded especially in the case of near-grazing beam illumination. Such a finding may inspire further theoretical and experimental efforts towards numerous research directions like non-invasive sensing, wireless optical tagging and energy teleportation."

ABSTRACT: Reciprocity is a fundamental physical principle that roots in the time-reversal symmetry of physical laws. It allows making predictions on any arbitrary complex system's response and operation and hence simplifies the analysis. However, there are many practical situations in which it is advantageous to break reciprocity, e.g., isolators preventing wave scattering back to lasers and generators, full-duplex systems for multiplexing transmission and receiving in the same channel, nonreciprocal cavity excitation, and protection of fragile states of superconductor quantum computers from thermal noise. The most widespread approach to time-reversal symmetry breaking and nonreciprocity based on magnetic field biasing suffers from bulkiness, cost ineffectiveness, and loss, motivating researchers and engineers to search for more practical approaches. Herein, the up-and-coming advances in optical nonreciprocity, including new materials (Weyl semimetals, topological insulators, metasurfaces), active structures, time-modulation, parity-time (PT)-symmetry breaking, nonlinearity combined with a structural asymmetry, quantum nonlinearity, unidirectional gain and loss, chiral quantum states and valley polarization are overviewed. A general description of nonreciprocal systems is provided and the pros and cons of the mentioned approaches to nonreciprocity are discussed.

ABSTRACT: It is shown, theoretically and numerically, that the distributions of the longitudinal energy flow for tightly focused light with circular and linear polarization are the same, and that the spot has circular symmetry. It is also shown that the longitudinal energy flows are equal for optical vortices with unit topological charge and with radial or azimuthal polarization. The focal spot has a minimum diameter (all other characteristics being equal), which is measured based on the intensity of an optical vortex with azimuthal polarization. The diameter of the focal spot calculated from the energy flow for light with circular or linear polarization is slightly larger (by a fraction of a percentage). The magnitude of the diameter based on the intensity plays a role in the interaction of light with matter, and the magnitude of the diameter based on the energy flux affects the resolution in optical microscopy which is crucial in sensorial applications.

ABSTRACT: Singular beams in the presence of Zernike aberrations create an opportunity for various applications such as trapping and manipulation of micro-particles, atomic optics and atmospheric optics. In the milieu of importance of the role of aberrations, sensitivity of singular beams with Zernike aberrations is studied. In this paper, the effect of various Zernike aberrations on a singular beam is reported in terms of its Point Spread Function (PSF) deformations. The intensity distributions around the focal plane, i.e. PSF, of the singular beam of various topological charges and in the presence of different strengths of Zernike aberrations are theoretically estimated by the Huygens-Fresnel diffraction integral. Experimentally, the singular beams have been generated and known strengths of Zernike aberration introduced in the beam by a phase-only Spatial Light Modulator. Metric Ensquared Energy is used to analyze the PSF of the corresponding intensity distributions of the singular beams. The experimental results have been validated with numerical simulation.

ABSTRACT: Polarization textures of light may reflect fundamental phenomena, such as topological defects, and can be utilized in engineering light beams. They have been observed, for instance, in photonic crystal lasers and semiconductor polariton condensates. Here we demonstrate domain wall polarization textures in a plasmonic lattice Bose-Einstein condensate. A key ingredient of the textures is found to be a condensate phase that varies spatially in a nontrivial manner. The phase of the Bose-Einstein condensate is reconstructed from the real- and Fourier-space images using a phase retrieval algorithm. We introduce a simple theoretical model that captures the results and can be used for design of the polarization patterns and demonstrate that the textures can be optically switched. The results open new prospects for fundamental studies of non-equilibrium condensation and sources of polarization-structured beams.

ABSTRACT: In this paper, we consider the comparative formation of perfect optical vortices in the non-paraxial mode using various optical elements: non-paraxial and parabolic toroidal vortex lenses, as well as a vortex axicon in combination with a parabolic lens. The theoretical analysis of the action of these optical elements, as well as the calculation of caustic surfaces, is carried out using a hybrid geometrical-optical and wave approach. Numerical analysis performed on the basis of the expansion in conical waves qualitatively confirms the results obtained and makes it possible to reveal more details associated with diffraction effects. Equations of 3D-caustic surfaces are obtained and the conditions of the ring radius dependence on the order of the vortex phase singularity are analyzed. In the non-paraxial mode, when small light rings (several tens of wavelengths) are formed, a linear dependence of the ring radius on the vortex order is shown. The revealed features should be taken into account when using the considered optical elements forming the POV in various applications.

ABSTRACT: Light beams possess various dimensions, such as wavelength, spin angular momentum (SAM), and orbital angular momentum (OAM), which are indispensable in numerous optical applications. However, traditional techniques entail multiple attempts to disclose desired optical information, utilizing unwieldy multi-pass systems or mechanically moving parts that are cumbersome to integrate into compact and integrated optical systems. Here, a single-layer dielectric metasurface platform is proposed that enables multi-dimensional demultiplexing and decoding, circumventing the need for conventional bulk optical elements. The platform can demultiplex 3D light parameters (wavelength, SAM, and OAM) and focus them at distinct spatial positions on a designated focal plane, providing a superior alternative to far-field beams for integration with optical fiber and communication chips. The study verifies 132-bit independent channels for a multi-dimensional demultiplexer and demonstrates the metasurface-based component's ability to function as an elliptic polarization decoder through a 4-bit elliptic polarization coding transmission experiment. This work provides a compact and efficient platform for demultiplexing multi-dimensional SAM and OAM states over a broad wavelength range, with potential implications for optical communications, optical data storage, optical information encryption, and quantum information sciences. A single-layer dielectric metasurface platform is proposed for multi-dimensional demultiplexing and decoding, providing a superior alternative to far-field beams for integrated applications. 132-bit independent channels for 3D light parameters (wavelength, polarization, and topological charge) are verified, and a 4-bits elliptic polarization coding transmission is demonstrated.image

ABSTRACT: Exceptional points (EPs) are non-Hermitian degeneracies or branch points where eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors coalesce. Due to the complex non-trivial topology of Riemann surfaces associated with non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, the dynamical encirclement or proximity of EPs in parameter space has been shown to lead to topological mode conversions and some novel physical phenomena. In fact, degeneracies can also form continuous line geometries, which are called exceptional lines (ELs). The problem is whether the state transfer around the ELs can show different characteristics from the EPs, which is less explored. Here, novel properties of quantum state transfer around the ELs based on a quantum walk platform are explored. It is found that the evolutionary state around the ELs is independent of the initial state and evolution direction, and the transfer of quantum state is more efficient than the case around the EPs. Furthermore, based on such a property, an entangled state generation insensitive to the incident state is realized experimentally. The work opens up a new way for the application of non-Hermitian physics in the field of quantum information. Quantum state transfer around exceptional lines (ELs) or exceptional points (EPs) based on a quantum walk platform are explored. The evolutionary state around ELs is independent of the initial state and evolution direction, and the transfer of quantum state is more efficient than around EPs. Furthermore, an entangled state generation insensitive to the incident state is realized experimentally.image

ABSTRACT: A Weyl semimetal with strong electron-phonon interaction can show axionic coupling in its insulator state at low temperatures, owing to the formation of a charge density wave (CDW). Such a CDW emerges in the linear-chain-compound Weyl semimetal Ta2Se8I below 263 K, resulting in the appearance of the dynamical condensed-matter axion quasiparticle. In this paper, we demonstrate that the interchain coupling in Ta2Se8I can be varied to suppress the CDW formation with pressure, while retaining the Weyl semimetal phase at high temperatures. Above 17 GPa, the Weyl semimetal phase does not survive, and we induce superconductivity, due to the amorphization of the iodine sublattice. Structurally, the quasi-one-dimensional Ta-Se chains remain intact and provide a channel for superconductivity. We highlight that our results show a near-complete suppression of the gap induced by the axionic charge density wave at pressures inaccessible to previous studies. Including this CDW phase, our experiments and theoretical predictions and analysis reveal the complete phase diagram of Ta2Se8I and its relationship to the nearby superconducting state. The results demonstrate Ta2Se8I to be a distinctively versatile platform for exploring correlated topological states.

ABSTRACT: In the last decade, metasurfaces emerged as a diversified benchmark for on-chip nanophotonic devices due to design privilege and extraordinary manipulation of electromagnetic waves. In metasurfaces for numerous applications, polarization and wavelength multiplexing at broadband wavelengths are highly desirable to boost data and security encryption. Here we proposed a birefringent planar all-dielectric spin-multiplexed metasurface in the ultraviolet (UV) regime at broadband wavelengths for optical security encryption with high non-linear efficiency. The presented metasurface features carefully engineered silicon nitride (Si3N4) (which provides transparency at almost the whole UV regime) rectangular bars. For the proof of concept, the designed metasurface was encoded for vortex beam generation with different topological charges based on the handedness of incident light. Instead of interleaved or layer stacking reported metasurfaces, the proposed single metasurface incorporates the property of simultaneous conversion of amplitude, polarization, and phase for spin-dependent vortex beam generation at broadband wavelengths in UV. For incident left circularly polarized (LCP) light, the metasurface generates the second-order vortex beam, whereas, for right circularly polarized (RCP) light illumination, it generates the fourth-order vortex beam. The proposed work can lead a new pathway toward many applications in UV nanophotonics.

ABSTRACT: "Significance Since the discovery of graphene in 2004, new monoelement based two-dimensional opto-electronic nanomaterials have received a great attention owing to the novel and excellent optoelectronic, electronic and mechanical features. Especially in recent years, it has stimulated the researchers to investigate the group-VA nanomaterials because of the excellent physiochemical properties. As a transition metal in group-VA, bismuth-based nanomaterials have been one of the research hot spots in the fields of materials and optics, which show great potential in the applications of electronics, opto-electronics and nonlinear optics, etc. Progress Generally speaking, the optical and electronic properties of the bismuth based nanomaterials ( including bismuthene) are related to the band structures and the carrier mobility in the nanomaterial systems. Normally, the design, fabrication and characterization have important impacts on the optical and electronic applications of the bismuth based nanomaterials. It is no doubt that the theoretical simulation, experimental study and the final application of the bismuth based nanomaterials have attracted a lot of attentions. Therefore, we briefly introduce the theoretical and experimental studies in terms of the simulation, fabrication, characterization and nonlinear optical applications in the recent years in this review. Theoretically, the first-principle simulation is the most powerful tool to understand the stability, band structures and carrier mobility. Up to date, both Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof ( HSE) hybrid-density functional theory ( DFT) calculation and Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof ( PBE) exchange-correlation functional calculation are used to simulate the monolayer bismuthene bandstructures and densities of states no matter taking the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect into account or not. Experimentally, different fabrication strategies of the bismuth based nanomaterials are reported. In 1960s, the physically sputtering method was taken to make the high quality bismuth ultrathin film in the micro-nano scale. With the development of the technology, molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) technology, ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) evaporation technology and the liquid-phase exfoliation (LPE) technology were proposed to obtain the few-layered bismuth ultrathin membranes. It was found that with different substrates, owing to the different lattice mismatching, the initial disordered wetting layer owing to the bismuth substrate interaction at the interface was observed, following by the stack of the bismuth layers until the normal lattice formation of the bismuth film. Obviously, the bismuth-based nanomaterials have the different topological insulating features. Thus the bismuth based nanomaterials are expected to possess a large nonlinear optical susceptibility like other topological insulators. Since 2017, researchers have investigated the nonlinear optical properties of few-layered bismuth based nanomaterials with different Z-scan and spatial phase modulation measurements. Currently, with the bismuthene in the fiber evanescent field as the saturable absorber, the minimum pulse duration of as short as 200 fs was realized in an Er-doped fiber at 1561 nm. While for the Yb or Tm doped fiber lasers, the mode-locking pulse duration was much longer. For the Q-switched operation, the shortest pulse durations at 1, 1.3 and 2 mu m were measured as 150, 155 and 440 ns, respectively. However, in the mid-infrared optical region, no matter the gain medium was a bulk crystal (Er SrF2) or an Er ZBLAN gain fiber, the pulse duration was as long as similar to 1 mu s. In addition, owing to the thermo-optical effect of bismuth, the bismuth nanomaterials could be used to realize the all-optical modulation with another manipulating beam. The recent investigations confirmed that the bismuth nanomaterials, synthesized by a lot of methods with different structures and thicknesses, possessed the excellent nonlinear optical features so that they could be used to produce the stable pulses in the optical region from the near-infrared to the mid-infrared. Conclusion and Prospect In conclusion, we briefly review the recent progress in the preparation, characterization and the nonlinear optical properties of bismuth-based nanomaterials, and highlight the research of the optical absorption features and the applications in the laser pulse generation. We believe that with the continuous in-depth research on preparation technology and properties of bismuthene nanomaterials, bismuthene materials will inevitably exert greater advantages in the fields of optoelectronic information technology and material science and technology. However, the future research of bismuth nanomaterials should be emphasized in these three aspects: 1) In terms of theoretical research, the electronic band structure of bismuth nanomaterials has been basically clear, but there are few studies on photogenerated carriers and their optical properties, therefore, the theoretical model and micro-mechanism still need further research  2) Although the preparation process of bismuth nanomaterials grown on silicon has been relatively mature, the application of bismuth nanomaterials in silicon-based photonics is still in urgent need of development  3) The bismuth nanomaterials exhibit good nonlinear optical absorption characteristics and have achieved modelocked fiber laser output. However, solid-state mode-locked lasers have not been reported, and the mode-locked pulse width in the mid-infrared band is as high as nanosecond. Obviously, researchers need to further study the effect of the anisotropy and topological properties of bismuthene materials on the nonlinear optical properties, and further optimize the nonlinear optical properties of bismuthene nanomaterials to achieve the breakthrough of the above-mentioned mode-locked laser."

ABSTRACT: A new set of vortex rotationally symmetric Bessel beams is investigated, which are Fourier-invariant and have low sidelobes, in contrast to all the other known Bessel beams. Complex amplitudes in the source plane and in the far field are obtained analytically. These beams are of finite energy (and thus physically realizable for the topological charge exceeding 4), but they do not have the Gaussian envelope. In the initial plane and in the Fraunhofer diffraction area, their complex amplitude is proportional to the Bessel function of a fractional order (odd integer number divided by 6), although the vortex itself is of an integer order. Compared to the zero-radial-index Laguerre?Gaussian modes, such beams have smaller inner dark spot. Such beams can be generated by a spatial light modulator and applied in data transmission, interferometry, trapping of metallic particles.

ABSTRACT: We propose a scheme to realize parity-time (PT) symmetric photonic Lieb lattices of ribbon shape and complex couplings, thereby demonstrating the higher-order exceptional point (EP) and Landau-Zener Bloch (LZB) oscillations in the presence of a refractive index gradient. Quite different from non-Hermitian flatband lattices with on-site gain/loss, which undergo thresholdless PT symmetry breaking, the spectrum for such quasi-one-dimensional Lieb lattices has completely real values when the index gradient is applied perpendicular to the ribbon, and a triply degenerated higher-order EP (EP3) with coalesced eigenvalues and eigenvectors emerges only when the amplitude of the gain/loss ratio reaches a certain threshold value. When the index gradient is applied parallel to the ribbon, the LZB oscillations exhibit intriguing characteristics, including asymmetric energy transition and pseudo-Hermitian propagation, as the flatband is excited. Meanwhile, a secondary emission occurs each time when the oscillatory motion passes through the EP3, leading to distinct energy distribution in the flatband when a dispersive band is excited. Such novel phenomena may appear in other non-Hermitian flatband systems. Our work may also bring insight and suggest a photonic platform to study the symmetry and topological characterization of higher-order EP that may find unique applications in, for example, enhancing sensitivity.(c) 2021 Author(s).

ABSTRACT: With the growing interest in the field of artificial materials, more advanced and sophisticated functionalities are required from phononic crystals and acoustic metamaterials. This implies a high computational effort and cost, and still the efficiency of the designs may be not sufficient. With the help of third-wave artificial intelligence technologies, the design schemes of these materials are undergoing a new revolution. As an important branch of artificial intelligence, machine learning paves the way to new technological innovations by stimulating the exploration of structural design. Machine learning provides a powerful means of achieving an efficient and accurate design process by exploring nonlinear physical patterns in high-dimensional space, based on data sets of candidate structures. Many advanced machine learning algorithms, such as deep neural networks, unsupervised manifold clustering, reinforcement learning and so forth, have been widely and deeply investigated for structural design. In this review, we summarize the recent works on the combination of phononic metamaterials and machine learning. We provide an overview of machine learning on structural design. Then discuss machine learning driven on-demand design of phononic metamaterials for acoustic and elastic waves functions, topological phases and atomic-scale phonon properties. Finally, we summarize the current state of the art and provide a prospective of the future development directions.

ABSTRACT: We demonstrate passively Q-switching in a 2.1 mu m Tm/Ho composite laser via developing a hybrid cavity to separate the intra-cavity Tm laser from modulated by the saturable absorber (SA). Enhancement in Ho laser efficiency was deomnstrated in the proposed hybird cavity, compared with the comnon two-mirror laser resonator. Using the crystalline Cr:ZnSe SA, maximum average output power of 553 mW at 2090 nm under absorbed 808 nm LD power of 6 W was obtained at pulse repetion rate of 9.5 kHz. Using layered WSe2 SA fabricated with the CVD process, maixmum Ho laser power of 141 mW with pulse width of 185 ns at a repetion rate of 33 kHz was obtained. The current gain medium could be replaced with other hosts such as YVO4, YLF, and YAP with natural birefringence, which facilities a potential polarized pulse Ho laser. Also, the current SAs could also be replaced by other nanomaterials with controllable broadband saturable absorption such as gold nanorods,topological insulators and carbon nano tube for seeking novel pulse Ho lasers.

ABSTRACT: "We present analytic expressions for the electronic contributions to the linear conductivity sigma((1))(3d)(omega) and the third-order optical conductivity sigma((3))(3d)(omega(1), omega(2), omega(3)) of three-dimensional massless Dirac Fermions, the quasi-particles relevant for the low energy excitation of topological Dirac and Weyl semimetals. Although there is no gap for massless Dirac Fermions, a finite chemical potential mu can lead to an effective gap parameter, which plays an important role in the qualitative features of interband optical transitions. For gapless linear dispersion in three dimensions, the imaginary part of the linear conductivity diverges as a logarithmic function of the cutoff energy, while the real part is linear, with a photon frequency omega as h omega > 2 vertical bar mu vertical bar. The third-order conductivity exhibits features very similar to those of two-dimensional Dirac Fermions, that is, graphene, but with the amplitude for a single Dirac cone generally 2 orders of magnitude smaller in three dimensions than in two dimensions. There are many resonances associated with the chemical-potential-induced gap parameters and divergences associated with the intraband transitions. The details of the third-order conductivity are discussed for third-harmonic generation, the Kerr effect and two-photon carrier injection, parametric frequency conversion, and two-color coherent current injection. Although the expressions we derive are limited to the clean limit at zero temperature, the generalization to include phenomenological relaxation processes at finite temperature is straightforward and is presented. In contrast with 2D materials, the bulk nature of materials that host three-dimensional Dirac Fermions allows for the possibility of enhancing nonlinear signals by tuning the sample thickness  thus, broad applications of such materials in nonlinear photonic devices can be envisioned."

ABSTRACT: In this work, using an expansion in terms of plane waves, we obtain all six components of the electric and magnetic field vectors for an elliptically polarized optical vortex with an arbitrary integer topological charge. We also obtain expressions for the distributions of the field intensity and the Poynting vector components in the initial plane of this optical vortex. For the particular case of a narrow angular spectrum of plane waves (Bessel beam) and for circular polarization, it is shown that in the presence of inhomogeneous evanescent waves in the initial light field, a reverse flux of light energy can occur near the optical axis. It is also shown that in the initial plane the effect of an angular tractor occurs, when at different distances from the optical axis the transverse energy flux rotates clockwise or counterclockwise. Using the obtained general expressions, the light flux for other known exact solutions of the Maxwell equations can be analyzed.

ABSTRACT: Two-dimensional (2D) materials with potential applications in photonic and optoelectronic devices have attracted increasing attention due to their unique structures and captivating properties. However, generation of stable high-energy ultrashort pulses requires further boosting of these materials' optical properties, such as higher damage threshold and larger modulation depth. Here we investigate a new type of heterostructure material with uniformity by employing the magnetron sputtering technique. Heterostructure materials are synthesized with van der Waals heterostructures consisting of MoS2 and Sb2Te3. The bandgap, carrier mobility, and carrier concentration of the MoS2-Sb2Te3-MoS2 heterostructure materials are calculated theoretically. By using these materials as saturable absorbers (SAs), applications in fiber lasers with Q-switching and mode-locking states are demonstrated experimentally. The modulation depth and damage threshold of SAs are measured to be 64.17% and 14.13 J/cm(2), respectively. Both theoretical and experimental results indicate that MoS2-Sb2Te3-MoS2 heterostructure materials have large modulation depth, and can resist high power during the generation of ultrashort pulses. The MoS2-Sb2Te3-MoS2 heterostructure materials have the advantages of low cost, high reliability, and suitability for mass production, and provide a promising solution for the development of 2D-material-based devices with desirable electronic and optoelectronic properties.

ABSTRACT: The pulse energy in the ultrafast soliton fiber laser oscillators is usually limited by the well-known wave-breaking phenomenon owing to the absence of a desirable real saturable absorber ( SA) with high power tolerance and large modulation depth. Here, we report a type of microfiber-based MoTe2 SA fabricated by the magnetron-sputtering deposition (MSD) method. High-energy wave-breaking free soliton pulses were generated with pulse duration/pulse energy/average output power of 229 fs/2.14 nJ/57 mW in the 1.5 mu m regime and 1.3 ps/13.8 nJ/212 mW in the 2 mu m regime, respectively. To our knowledge, the generated soliton pulses at 1.5 mu m had the shortest pulse duration and the highest output power among the reported erbium-doped fiber lasers mode locked by transition metal dichalcogenides. Moreover, this was the first demonstration of a MoTe2-based SA in fiber lasers in the 2 mu m regime, and the pulse energy/output power are the highest in the reported thulium-doped fiber lasers mode locked by two-dimensional materials. Our results suggest that a microfiber-based MoTe2 SA could be used as an excellent photonic device for ultrafast pulse generation, and the MSD technique opens a promising route to produce a high-performance SA with high power tolerance and large modulation depth, which are beneficial for high-energy wave-breaking free pulse generation.

ABSTRACT: In this review article, we describe recent progress about exotic self-assembled systems with various dimensions including biomolecules, supramolecules, unique hydrophobic amphiphiles. polymers, nano-clusters. and colloidal particles. Construction of robust biomolecular assemblies with exotic structures, such as ring and hollow capsule, is achieved by rational designs of symmetric biomolecular conjugates. In addition, we comprehensively summarized leading-edge topics on optical/topological properties of self-assembled hybrid systems, such as circularly polarized luminescence or structural color. The preparation of colloidal amorphous array with photonic band gap-induced angle-independent structural color is also achieved in consideration of the following situations: i) two-body sphere-sphere potential, ii) disorder packing using different sizes of colloidal particles, and iii) softness of colloidal particles. Lastly, we demonstrated useful utilizations of exotic self-assembled objects. Flakelike microparticles were transcribed into various nano-flake metals and applied as temperature indicator for the local heating of an addictive. All findings described here show meaningful hybrid strategies in self-assembly techniques and their functionalization as well as materialization. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: We propose and study numerically and experimentally two methods for determining the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of paraxial laser beams. One method is based on registering the intensity in the Fresnel zone, numerically averaging this intensity over the polar angle at discrete radii, and solving a system of linear equations to find squared modules of the coefficients of the light field expansion in terms of basis functions. The other method is based on registering two intensity distributions in the Fourier plane of two cylindrical lenses rotated 90 degrees relative to each other, and calculating the first-order moments of the measured intensities. The experimental error of the OAM determination is about 1% for small fractional OAM (up to 4), and about 8% for large fractional OAM (up to 30).

ABSTRACT: Based on an analogy between the macroscopic phenomena and quantum physics, we study the problem of energy conversion for the sum frequency generation (SFG) process in a linear chirped quasi-phase-matched (QPM) crystal. We show that the process of energy conversion from the signal to the sum frequency field is very similar to the process of Landau-Zener tunneling (LZT) in a two-level system. Therefore, the energy conversion mechanism of SFG process can be explained by the theory of LZT. In addition, we obtain the asymptotic and analytical solution of the sum frequency field by solving the coupled equations with the model of Landau-Zener.

ABSTRACT: Mid-infrared (mid-IR) ultrafast lasers are widely employed in biomedicine, molecular spectroscopy, material processing, and nonlinear optics. With the improvement of fiber gain media and other fiber optical elements, low-cost, compact, and high-efficiency fiber lasers open up new opportunities for 2-4 mu m pulse generations, which calls for a comprehensive review of their mode-locking mechanisms, gain media, and fiber laser system performance. This paper, beginning with an overview of pulse-generation technologies, reviews recent progress on 2-4 mu m mid-IR ultrafast fiber lasers, including Tm3+-, Ho3+-doped, Tm3+/Ho3+ codoped silicate fiber 2 mu m lasers, and Er3+-, Dy3+-doped, and Ho3+/Pr3+ codoped ZBLAN fiber 2.5-4 mu m lasers. Among them, the status of 2-4 mu m ultrafast fiber lasers based on 2D material passive mode-locking is emphatically discussed. Meanwhile, the novel advances on mode-locking and gain fibers of mid-IR ultrafast fiber lasers are explored. Furthermore, current and prospective applications of such laser systems are also introduced in detail. This review finally summarizes challenges associated with future development of mid-IR ultrafast fiber lasers, which provides an outlook on how to achieve more desirable laser performance (e.g., higher average power, higher pulse energy, and longer emission wavelength) that can lead to more practical uses of such lasers. Recent development of mode-locking technologies and fiber gain media enables 2-4 mu m mid-infrared pulse generations toward high-performance, low-cost, and compact fiber laser systems. This review provides a close-up examination of novel mode-locking mechanisms, fiber gain and low-dimensional saturable absorbing materials, current integrated fiber laser systems, and future development of mid-infrared ultrafast fiber lasers toward broader application scenarios.image

ABSTRACT: Although nanoparticle (NP) assemblies are at the beginning of their development, their unique geometrical shapes and media-responsive optical, electronic, and magnetic properties have attracted significant interest. Nanoscale assembly bridges multiple levels of hierarchy of materials: dual nanoparticles, discrete molecule-like or virus-like nanoscale agglomerates, microscale devices, and macroscale materials. The capacity to self-assemble on greatly facilitate the integration of nanotechnology with other technologies and, in particular, with microscale fabrication. In this Account, we describe developments in the emerging field of dynamic NP assemblies, which are spontaneously form superstructures containing more than two inorganic nanoscale particles that display the ability to change their geometrical, physical, chemical, and other attributes. In many ways, dynamic assemblies ran represent a bottleneck in the bottom-up fabrication of NP-based devices bemuse they can produce a much greater variety of assemblies, but they also provide a convenient tool for variation of geometries and dimensions of nanoparticle assemblies. Superstructures of NPs (and those held together by similar intrinsic forces)are classified into two groups: Class 1 where media and external fields can alter shape, conformation, and order of stable super structures with a nearly constant number of NPs or Class 2 where the total number of NPs changes, while the organizational motif in the final superstructure remains the same. The future development of successful dynamic assemblies requires understanding the equilibrium in dynamic NP systems. The dynamic nature of Class 1 assemblies is associated with the equilibrium between different conformations of a superstructure and is comparable to the isomerization in classical chemistry. Class 2 assemblies involve the formation or breakage of linkages between the NPs, which is analogous to the classical chemical equilibrium for the formation of a molecule from atoms. Finer classification of NP assemblies in accord with established conventions in the field may include different size dimensionalities: discrete assemblies (artificial molecules) and one-dimensional (spaced chains), two-dimensional (sheets), and three-dimensional (superlattices, twisted structures) assemblies. Notably, these dimensional attributes must be regarded as primarily topological in nature because all of these superstructures can acquire complex three-dimensional shapes. We discuss three primary strategies used to prepare NP superstructures: (1) anisotropy-based assemblies utilizing either intrinsic force field anisotropy around NPs or external anisotropy associated with templates or applied fields, (2) assembly methods utilizing uniform NPs with isotropic interactions, and (3) methods based on mutual recognition of biomolecules, such as DNA and antigen antibody interactions. We consider optical, electronic, and magnetic properties of dynamic superstructures, focusing primarily on multiparticle effects in NP superstructures as represented by surface plasmon resonance, NP-NP charge transport, and multibody magnetization. Unique properties of NP superstructures are being applied to biosensing, drug delivery, and nanoelectronics. For both Class 1 and Class 2 dynamic assemblies, biosensing is the most dominant and well-developed area of dynamic nanostructures being successfully transitioned into practice. We can foresee the rapid development of dynamic NP assemblies toward applications in harvesting of dissipated energy, photonics, and electronics. The final part of this Account is devoted to the fundamental questions facing dynamic assemblies of NPs in the future.

ABSTRACT: Using electronic beam lithography and reactive ion beam etching, a metalens is manufactured in a thin layer of amorphous silicon of a 130-nm depth, a 30-mu m diameter, and a 633-nm focal length (equal to the illumination wavelength). The metalens is composed of 16 sectored subwavelength binary gratings with a 220-nm period. The uniqueness of this metalens is that when illuminated by left-handed circularly polarized light, it is capable of generating a left-handed circularly polarized vortex beam with a topological charge of 2, generating a second-order cylindrical vector beam when illuminated by linearly polarized light. Both for linear and circular incident polarization, an energy backflow is found to be generated in the vicinity of the tight focus. Transverse intensity distributions measured with a scanning near-field optical microscope near the focus of the metalens are in qualitative agreement with the intensity distributions calculated by the FDTD method. This confirms that a backward energy flow takes place at the focus of the metalens. A metalens generating an energy backflow near its focus is fabricated and characterized for the first time.

ABSTRACT: "The tightly focused structured light field displays a non-negligible component of the electric field in the direction of propagation, i.e., the longitudinal light field. The longitudinal light field results in various novel optical phenomena, such as transverse spin angular momentum and 3D topological light fields. However, it remains a challenge to generate customized longitudinal light fields. Here, based on inverse design theory, the longitudinal light field can be customized on demand under the tightly focusing condition, which allows to generate the longitudinal light field with controllable structured distribution for propagating waves or manipulate the complex structures for all the three components of the electric field. In experiment, an experimental system is built integrating the generation, customization, and detection of structured longitudinal light field, and the customization of the longitudinal light fields with various patterns is experimentally realized. The customized longitudinal light field structures may find applications such as information encoding, long-distance light manipulation, and novel light-matter interactions. As an example, information encoding is realized by the structured longitudinal light fields. The inverse design theory is introduced to customize the optical longitudinal field with arbitrary complex structures on demand. Based on the experimental system integrating the generation, manipulation, and detection of longitudinal field, different information can be encoded in the longitudinal field and be hidden in the transverse field, developing a new method of information encoding using the longitudinal field.image & COPY  2023 WILEY-VCH GmbH"

ABSTRACT: All-optical control of magnetization vectors is considered as a powerful solution that empowers the development of multifunctional integrated optomagnetic devices. The interaction between vectorial light and magnetism has recently experienced a surge of interest due to its prominent ability to steer the magnetic polarization orientations and spatial textures within the subwavelength domain, which, however, usually requires complex wavefront coding optimizers or arduous material fabrication procedures. Herein, an optimization-free all-vectorial-optical strategy for first realizing spatially twist-controllable and successively polarization-tunable magnetization at the subdiffraction scale through the inverse Faraday effect is conceived and demonstrated. This facile method relies on the coherent coupling of double crossed azimuthally polarized doughnut-Gaussian vortex beams in a single optically configured geometry. It is found that both the magnetic twisting manifolds and polarization states, rotating from perpendicular (longitudinal), via hybrid (3D) to in-plane (transverse) orientations, can be on-demand mediated by judiciously tuning the crossing angles. It is further unraveled that the orbital angular momenta associated with topological charges of the vortex beams can be viewed as a vital knob to energetically maneuver magnetic twisting and guide magnetization switching. It is believed that the proposed route and presented findings are not only of great theoretical implication in twistronics and optomagnetic topology but also of considerable technological significance in multidimensional high-density and low-energy consumption optomagnetic storage and engineering of magnetic topologic materials.

ABSTRACT: Metallic components such as plasmonic gratings and plasmonic lenses are routinely used to convert free-space beams into propagating surface plasmon polaritons and vice versa. This generation of couplers handles relatively simple light beams, such as plane waves or Gaussian beams. Here we present a powerful generalization of this strategy to more complex wave-fronts, such as vortex beams that carry orbital angular momentum, also known as topological charge. This approach is based on the principle of holography: the coupler is designed as the interference pattern of the incident vortex beam and focused surface plasmon polaritons. We have integrated these holographic plasmonic interfaces into commercial silicon photodiodes, and demonstrated that such devices can selectively detect the orbital angular momentum of light. This holographic approach is very general and can be used to selectively couple free-space beams into any type of surface wave, such as focused surface plasmon polaritons and plasmonic Airy beams.

ABSTRACT: Recent broad interest in the physics and applications of ultraslow waves in nanoscale structures range from light-waves or surface plasmons in nanoplasmonic devices to sound waves in acoustic-metamaterial waveguides, as well as plasmons and phonon polaritons in graphene and van der Waals crystals. Here we highlight that combining ultraslow waves with active photonic quantum materials opens up new domains for science, materials physics and engineering, providing the foundation for novel photonic quantum and communication technologies and nanolasing. We will outline the underlying physics of ultraslow waves on the nanoscale and discuss far-reaching opportunities resulting from a combination of ultraslow waves and active photonic quantum materials enabling single quantum emitter strong coupling. The ultrafast spatio-temporal dynamics of cavity-free stopped-light nanolasing and surface plasmon polariton condensation in nanoplasmonic heterostructures are yet further reflections of the special properties of light in the vicinity of stopped-light singularities, while a combination of stopped-light modes with epsilon-near-zero and topological materials with vanishing refractive index offer further exciting possibilities for nanophotonics.

ABSTRACT: It is essential to study the thermal dewetting behavior of as-deposited nano-films for large scale and high-throughput fabrication. We report here on the nucleation of Au nanostructures onto titanium dioxide (TiOx) thin films surfaces, which occurred in consecutive steps. First, TiOx thin films were grown on quartz substrates reactively by e-beam evaporator and then thermally annealed at different temperatures, starting from 300 degrees C to 900 degrees C. Subsequently, a nano-film of Au was deposited on the top of these TiOx surfaces. The stacked Au/TiOx samples were post-annealed using muffle furnace at a temperature of 600 degrees C for 1 h, to study the thermal dewetting properties and the controlled growth of the different TiOx morphologies on the formation of Au nanoparticles (NP) and their plasmonic response. Such dual-structures were characterized accordingly to probe their topological, morphological, structural, and optical properties, by means of x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope, atomic force microscopy, and ultra-violet-visible-near infrared characterization techniques. The thermal dewetting properties were found to improve at high temperatures (>500 degrees C), where the Au NP size distribution was found to follow a Gaussian pattern centered around 30 nm. The average surface roughness also increased significantly with respect to the TiOx dewetting temperature, which is mainly attributed to the porosity of the films. Finally, the absorption peak for Au nanostructures has shown a localized surface plasmon resonance close to 520 nm, along with a broad shoulder peak with a strong tail thereby reflecting the wide distribution of the formed Au NP sizes.

ABSTRACT: Lateral confinement of layered, two-dimensional (2D) materials has uniquely enabled the exploration of several topological phenomena in electron transport due to the well-defined nanoscale cross-sections and perimeters. At present, research on laterally confined 2D materials is constrained by the lack of synthesis methods that can reliably and controllably produce nanostructures with narrow widths and high aspect ratios. We demonstrate the use of thermomechanical nanomolding (TMNM) to fabricate nanowires of six layered materials (Te, In2Se3, Bi2Te3, Bi2Se3, GaSe, and Sb2Te3) with widths of 40 nm and aspect ratios above 100. During molding, the van der Waals (vdW) layers rotate by 90 degrees from the horizontal direction in the bulk feedstock to the vertical direction in the molded nanowire, such that the layers are aligned along the nanowire length. We find that interfacial diffusion and surface energy minimization drive nanowire formation during TMNM, often resulting in single-crystalline nanowires with consistent crystallographic orientation.

ABSTRACT: Beating is a simple physical phenomenon known for long in the context of sound waves but remained surprisingly unexplored for light waves. When two monochromatic optical beams of different frequencies and states of polarization interfere, the polarization state of the superposition field exhibits temporal periodic variation-polarization beating. In this work, we reveal a foundational and elegant phase structure underlying such polarization beating. We show that the phase difference over a single beating period decomposes into the Pancharatnam-Berry geometric phase and a dynamical phase of which the former depends exclusively on the intensities and polarization states of the interfering beams whereas the sum of the phases is determined solely by the beam frequencies. Varying the intensity and polarization characteristics of the beams, the relative contributions of the geometric and dynamical phases can be adjusted. The geometric phase inherent in polarization beating is governed by a compact expression containing only the Stokes parameters of the interfering waves and can alternatively be obtained from the individual beam intensities and the amplitude of the intensity beats. We demonstrate both approaches experimentally by using an interferometer with a fast detector and a specific polarimetric arrangement. Polarization beating has a unique character that the geometric and dynamical phases are entangled, i.e. variation in one unavoidably leads to a change in the other. Our work expands geometric phases into a new domain and offers important novel insight into the role of polarization in interference of electromagnetic waves.

ABSTRACT: The rare-earth or 3d transition metal dopants in perovskites have potential to induce interesting features, thus opening opportunities for investigations and applications. Hence, understanding some features, i.e., defect structure, site of incorporation, valence state, and mechanism of charge compensation, in a wide range of temperature is crucial for their technological applications. A comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of structural changes in PbTiO3 doped with trivalent rare-earths is significant for their potential applications in photonics. To unravel the structural changes, we utilize the density functional theory (DFT) to optimize structural data, which then serve as input for the semiempirical superposition model (SPM) analysis of spectroscopic and magnetic properties of Gd3+-doped PbTiO3. We compute the formation energies of the doped compounds with and without O-vacancy to determine the stable composition. Analysis of the Bader electron charges computed using DFT plus quantum theory of atoms in molecules enables elucidating the effects of the Gd dopant and O-vacancy on the ionic and covalent bonds and, thereby, chemical stability of the compositions. To explain and corroborate the zero-field splitting parameters (ZFSPs) measured by EMR and the lattice parameter changes obtained from XRD, we employ SPM. The optimized structures obtained from ab initio computations for various structural models of Gd3+ doped PbTiO3 are utilized as input data for SPM calculations of ZFPs. This enables theoretical analysis of variations of ZFSPs from 5 to 780 K. The results were fine-tuned by matching with available experimental EMR data for Gd3+ probes in PbTiO3 nanoparticles. Modeling has been carried out considering several possible structural models and the role of an O-vacancy around Gd3+ centers. The results show that the two-fold modeling approach, combining DFT and SPM, provides a reliable description of experimental data. Comparative analysis indicates that the Ti-site is less favorable for being replaced by Gd3+ with/without O-vacancy. This analysis confirms the plausibility of the Pb2+ site for Gd3+ dopants and sheds light on the changes of crystal structure during the phase transitions occurring in PbTiO3 with decreasing temperature.

ABSTRACT: We predict the preservation of temporal indistinguishability of photons propagating through helical coupled-resonator optical waveguides (H-CROWs). H-CROWs exhibit a pseudospin-momentum locked dispersion, which we show suppresses on-site disorder-induced backscattering and group velocity fluctuations. We simulate numerically the propagation of two-photon wave packets, demonstrating that they exhibit almost perfect Hong-Ou-Mandel dip visibility and then can preserve their quantum coherence even in the presence of moderate disorder, in contrast with regular CROWs, which are highly sensitive to disorder. As indistinguishability is the most fundamental resource of quantum information processing, H-CROWs may find applications for the implementation of robust optical links and delay lines in the emerging quantum photonic communication and computational platforms.

ABSTRACT: We perform a comparative study of second-harmonic generation (SHG) from indium tin oxide (ITO) and from titanium nitride (TiN) nanolayers excited in the near-infrared spectrum. Both materials are compatible with Si technology and are candidate platforms for integrated nonlinear optics. In this work, we fabricate ITO samples with an e-near-zero (ENZ) condition, which can be continuously tailored in the 1150-1670 nm spectral range, and TiN samples with a metallic behavior in the same spectral range. For the ITO nanolayers, we observe tunability and enhancement of the SHG intensity when the samples are excited at their respective ENZ condition, in agreement with the electromagnetic modeling and analogous to its third-harmonic generation studied earlier. On the other hand, we show that the SHG efficiency of TiN nanolayers is lower by a factor of 50. We determine experimentally that the dominant component of the second-order susceptibility for our best ITO nanolayer is chi((2 omega))(zzz)) = 0.18 pm V-1, and we theoretically predict that the SHG process is enhanced up to 4 orders of magnitude when resonantly pumping the nanolayer at the ENZ wavelength with respect to a wavelength at 2000 nm. Remarkably, the resulting SHG efficiency is comparable with a crystalline quartz plate with thickness 0.5 mm used as a reference in our experiments in reflection configuration. Our study clearly indicates that ITO nanolayers with engineered ENZ conditions are a promising material platform for surface nonlinearities, with possible applications to nonlinear metasurfaces, Si-based flat optics, and sensing.

ABSTRACT: Light carrying an orbital angular momentum (OAM) displays an optical phase front rotating in space and time and a vanishing intensity, a so-called vortex, in the center. Beyond continuous-wave vortex beams, optical pulses with a finite OAM are important for many areas of science and technology, ranging from the selective manipulation and excitation of matter to telecommunications. Generation of vortex pulses with a duration of few optical cycles requires new methods for characterising their coherence properties in space and time. Here we report a novel approach for flexibly shaping and characterising few-cycle vortex pulses of tunable topological charge with two sequentially arranged spatial light modulators. The reconfigurable optical arrangement combines interferometry, wavefront sensing, time-of-flight and nonlinear correlation techniques in a very compact setup, providing complete spatio-temporal coherence maps at minimum pulse distortions. Sub-7 fs pulses carrying different optical angular momenta are generated in single and multichannel geometries and characterised in comparison to zero-order Laguerre-Gaussian beams. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the shortest pulse durations reported for direct vortex shaping and detection with spatial light modulators. This access to space-time coupling effects with sub-femtosecond time resolution opens new prospects for tailored twisted light transients of extremely short duration.

ABSTRACT: Herein we propose a design of a wavelength-tunable integrated vortex beam emitter based on the silicon-on-insulator platform. The emitter is implemented using a PN-depletion diode inside a microring resonator with the emitting hole grating that was used to produce a vortex beam. The resonance wavelengths can be shifted due to the refractive index change associated with the free plasma dispersion effect. Obtained numerical modeling results confirm the efficiency of the proposed approach, providing a resonance wavelength shift while maintaining the required topological charge of the emitted vortex beam. It is known that optical vortices got a lot of attention due to extensive telecommunication and biochemical applications, but also, they have revealed some beneficial use cases in sensors. Flexibility in spectral tuning demonstrated by the proposed device can significantly improve the accuracy of sensors based on fiber Bragg gratings. Moreover, we demonstrate that the proposed device can provide a displacement of the resonance by the value of the free spectral range of the ring resonator, which means the possibility to implement an ultra-fast orbital angular momentum (de)multiplexing or modulation.

ABSTRACT: "The potassium dihydrogen phosphate K(H2PO4) (KDP) cluster structures formed in aqueous solutions have been theoretically and experimentally investigated. Cluster modeling of the self-assembly of supramolecular KDP structures is performed, and oligomer clusters (dimers, tetramers, and octamers) are determined. Oligomer clusters are found for the first time in saturated KDP aqueous solutions in the temperature range of 5-80 degrees C by small-angle X-ray scattering  their oligomeric composition is quantitatively estimated. It is shown that potassium dihydrogen phosphate exists in the form of dimers in a supersaturated solution in a wide temperature range, and only sharp cooling leads to the occurrence of other clusters: first tetramers and then octamers  the latter are presumably primary chains of the KDP crystal structure. The distance between tetramer centers corresponds to the translation period c = 6.906 angstrom."

ABSTRACT: Heteroatomic modulation of MnO2 is an effective way to introduce and tailor the catalytically active sites for electrochemical water oxidation. While great efforts have been devoted to parsing the configuration and coordination of dopants in dictating the catalytic activity, less is considered about the feedback from the structurally adapted MnO2 host to the intrinsic activity of catalytic sites. In this study, the topological effect on oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity was systemically investigated for partially Ru-substituted MnO2 of various polymorphs. We show that MnO2 of different porosities responds differently to the Ru integration, thereby resulting in varied lattice strains and morphological changes. While the highly porous tau-MnO2 undergoes amorphization upon Ru substitution, the closely packed beta-MnO2 suffers crystal splintering with drastically enhanced structural defects, which lends to a low OER overpotential of 278 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and a high turnover frequency of 2022.2 h-1 that is 19.6-fold higher than that of the commercial RuO2 benchmark. Therefore, the integration of Ru does not simply append active sites to the relatively inert metal oxides but simultaneously modifies the crystal structure of MnO2 to retroactively modulate the catalytic activity. We further show that OER on the Ru-substituted beta-MnO2 follows a lattice oxygen mechanism as a result of the adapted oxide substrate. This study furnishes a fresh and systemic view on the dopant-substrate interplay for modulating the electrocatalytic activity of tunneled MnO2 structures.

ABSTRACT: By utilizing customized intra-cavity optical elements including graded-phase mirrors, variable reflectivity mirrors, aspherical mirrors, diffractive optical elements and spatial light modulators, the mode discrimination of the cavity is enhanced and a pre-determined transverse mode, usually flat-top beams such as super-Gaussian beams or flattened-Gaussian beams, can be generated in the cavity. The design of such laser cavities oscillating in a predetermined transverse mode is commonly based on the concept of phase conjugation, whereby the desired phase profile of optical element is obtained by reversely propagating the predetermined transverse mode and creating a conjugate field to propagate back. However, this procedure is only accurate under the assumption that the mirror size is infinite and the propagation process is in a lossless manner. Moreover, the parameters of the pre-determined mode, such as beam size and amplitude distribution, must be carefully chosen or else non-negligible errors would occur due to finite-size apertures and associated truncation. Here, we report on a simple and effective approach for intra-cavity mode control based on optimizing the single-mode power factor, which represents the total power extracted by a single mode from the active medium. By optimizing the single-mode power factor of the desired mode, the cavity can be designed to operate in mono-mode, increasing the mode purity significantly. Our method is verified on a digital laser with a spatial light modulator as the rear mirror and the loaded phase profile is acquired by a simulated annealing algorithm. As a result, when the single-mode power factor of TEM00 mode is optimized, the resonator operates in a single fundamental mode. When the single-mode power factor of the vortex mode with a topological charge of 1 is optimized, the output mode purity is close to 100%.

ABSTRACT: We demonstrate a Q-switched Raman fiber laser using molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) as a saturable absorber (SA). The SA is assembled by depositing a mechanically exfoliated MoS2 onto a fiber ferrule facet before it is matched with another clean ferrule via a connector. It is inserted in a Raman fiber laser cavity with a total cavity length of about 8 km to generate a Q-switching pulse train operating at 1560.2 nm. A 7.7-km-long dispersion compensating fiber with 584 ps.nm(-1) km(-1) of dispersion is used as a nonlinear gain medium. As the pump power is increased from 395 mW to 422 mW, the repetition rate of the Q-switching pulses can be increased from 132.7 to 137.4 kHz while the pulse width is concurrently decreased from 3.35 mu s to 3.03 mu s. The maximum pulse energy of 54.3 nJ is obtained at the maximum pump power of 422 mW. These results show that the mechanically exfoliated MoS2 SA has a great potential to be used for pulse generation in Raman fiber laser systems.

ABSTRACT: A preliminary study on the interband transition of graphene was done via reflectance spectra of graphene/SiO2 sample at various applied potential. Prior to that, Raman spectroscopy and four-point probe measurement was done on graphene/SiO2 sample. It was found that the sample consisted of monolayer graphene with sheet resistance around 402.32 Omega/square. Post-processing of the reflectance data lead to the plot of ratio of change in reflectance towards reflectance at 0 V (Delta R/R) against applied potential. From there, the ratio increases along with applied potential, indicative of higher absorption due to interband transition.

ABSTRACT: In this paper, we demonstrated ytterbium-doped mode-locked fiber lasers based on saturable absorbers (SAs) made of few-layer black phosphorus (BP) with all normal dispersion. The few-layer BP was prepared with the liquid phase exfoliation method and was deposited onto fiber facets by an optically driven process. By incorporating the BP-SA into an ytterbium-doped fiber cavity, stable mode-locking laser operation in all-normal dispersion region was achieved with a repetition rate of 46.3 MHz. The laser spectrum was centered at 1030.6 nm with a 3 dB bandwidth of 0.11 nm. Maximum output power of 32.5 mW was achieved and showing no signs of saturation.

ABSTRACT: The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is an algorithm to find eigenenergies and eigenstates of systems in quantum chemistry and quantum many-body physics. The VQE is one of the most promising applications of near-term quantum devices to investigate such systems. Here we propose an extension of the VQE to calculate the nonadiabatic couplings of molecules in quantum chemical systems and Berry's phase in quantum many-body systems. Both quantities play an important role in understanding the properties of a system beyond the naive adiabatic picture, e.g., nonadiabatic dynamics and topological phase of matter. We provide quantum circuits and classical postprocessings to calculate the nonadiabatic couplings and Berry's phase. Specifically, we show that the evaluation of the nonadiabatic couplings reduces to that of expectation values of observables while that of Berry's phase also requires one additional Hadamard test. Furthermore, we simulate the photodissociation dynamics of a lithium fluoride molecule using the nonadiabatic couplings evaluated on a real quantum device. Our proposal widens the applicability of the VQE and the possibility of near-term quantum devices to study molecules and quantum many-body systems.

ABSTRACT: A reverse energy flow is theoretically demonstrated to occur in the interference pattern generated by four plane waves with linear polarization. In some regions of the interference pattern, the right-handed triplets of plane-wave vectors k (k(z)> 0), E, and H (comprising a wave vector and E- and H-field vectors) sum up to form an electromagnetic field described by a right-handed triplet of vectors k (k(z) < 0), E, and H. It is in these regions that the negative propagation of light occurs. On the optical axis the orbital energy flow, proportional to the light intensity, is shown to be positive, while the spin flow is negative and exceeds the orbital flow in magnitude. That is why the on-axis summary energy flow is negative. The magnitude of the reverse flow on the optical axis is two times lower than that of the intensity. A similar mechanism may apply to the case of sharply focusing a laser beam with second-order polarization or phase singularity. Using two identical micro-objectives with a numerical aperture of 0.95, it has been demonstrated experimentally that the intensity on the optical axis near the focus of an optical vortex with a topological charge of 2 is zero for right circular polarization and nonzero for left circular polarization. This confirms that in the latter case there is the reverse flow of light energy on the optical axis, since in the center of the measured energy flow distribution there is a very weak local maximum (the Arago spot) aroused due to diffraction of the forward flow by a circle with a diameter of 300 nm (the diameter of the tube with the reverse flow). Comparing the numerical and experimental intensity distributions, it is possible to determine the diameter of a tube with the reverse flow. For a numerical aperture of 0.95 and a wavelength of 532 nm, the diameter of the tube of the reverse flow along the optical axis is 300 nm. It is also shown experimentally that when an optical beam with second-order cylindrical polarization is focused with a numerical aperture of 0.95, there is a circularly symmetric energy flow in the focus with a very weak flow in the center (the Arago spot), whose distribution is determined by diffraction of the forward flux by an similar to 300-nm-diameter circular area, where the energy flow is reverse. This also confirms that in the latter case, there is a reverse energy flow on the optical axis.

ABSTRACT:  LASER PHYSICS AND PHOTONICS XVI  AND COMPUTATIONAL BIOPHYSICS" We study a non-paraxial family of nondiffracting laser beams whose complex amplitude is proportional to an n-th order Lommel function of two variables. These beams are referred to as Lommel modes. We also study finite-energy paraxial Lommel-Gaussian beams with their complex amplitude being proportional to the Lommel function and to the amplitude of the Gaussian beam. Explicit analytical relations for orbital angular momentum of the Lommel modes and Lommel-Gaussian beams have been derived. Asymmetry of the Lommel modes depends on a complex parameter.. Besides, with the modulus of the. parameter increasing from 0 to 1, the orbital angular momentum of the Lommel modes increases from a finite value proportional to the topological charge n to infinity. The orbital angular momentum of the Lommel modes undergoes continuous variations, in contrast to its discrete changes in the Bessel modes. Simulation by the beam propagation method showed that in initial plane the transverse intensity distribution of the Lommel-Gaussian beam contains a light ellipse with two bright spots. During propagation, these spots rotate by an angle, close to 90 degrees, at a much smaller distance than the Rayleigh range.

ABSTRACT: Graphene and related two-dimensional materials are promising candidates for atomically thin, flexible and transparent opto-electronics(1,2). In particular, the strong light-matter interaction in graphene(3) has allowed for the development of state-of-the-art photodetectors(4,5), optical modulators(6) and plasmonic devices(7). In addition, electrically biased graphene on SiO2 substrates can be used as a low-efficiency emitter in the mid-infrared range(8,9). However, emission in the visible range has remained elusive. Here, we report the observation of bright visible light emission from electrically biased suspended graphene devices. In these devices, heat transport is greatly reduced(10). Hot electrons (similar to 2,800 K) therefore become spatially localized at the centre of the graphene layer, resulting in a 1,000-fold enhancement in thermal radiation efficiency(8,9). Moreover, strong optical interference between the suspended graphene and substrate can be used to tune the emission spectrum. We also demonstrate the scalability of this technique by realizing arrays of chemical-vapour-deposited graphene light emitters. These results pave the way towards the realization of commercially viable large-scale, atomically thin, flexible and transparent light emitters and displays with low operation voltage and graphene-based on-chip ultrafast optical communications.

ABSTRACT: Diffractive optical elements for the formation of laser beams with intensity distributions in the form of ring light traps with zero total orbital angular momentum are considered and studied by means of a computational experiment. The beams are formed as a superposition of two vortex beams with the same magnitude but different sign orbital angular momentum by encoding multilevel diffractive optical elements (256 quantization levels) in polar angle. The considered elements form an intensity distribution in the form of spots located in the same places where the light rings are located in the initial vortex beams. Such beams can possess all the properties of vortex beams when propagating in the atmosphere, for example, increased stability to aerosol noise.

ABSTRACT: Biomimetic materials are used for creating microsystems to control cell growth spatially and elicit specific cellular responses by combining complex biomolecules with nanostructured surfaces. Intercellular cell-to-cell and cell-to-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions in biomimetic materials have demonstrated potential in the development of drug discovery platforms and regeneration medicine. In this study, we developed a biomimetic nanostructured matrix by using various ECM molecular layers to create a biomimetic and biocompatible environment for realizing neuronal guidance in neural regeneration medicine. Silicon-based substrates possessing nanostructures were modified using different ECM proteins and peptides to develop a biomimetic and biocompatible environment for studying neural behaviors in adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation. The substrates were flat glass, flat silicon wafers (FWs), and nanorod-structured wafers prepared using wet etching. The three substrates were then functionalized using laminin-1 peptide, PA22-2-contained active isoleucine-lysine-valine-alanine-valine (IKVAV) peptide, and poly-D-lysine (PDL), separately. When PC12 cells were cultured and differentiated on the modified substrates, the cells were able to elongate the neurites on the glass and FW, which was coated with three types of peptide. More differentiated neurons were observed on the nanorod-structured wafers coated with laminin than on those coated with IKVAV or PDL. For achieving directional guidance of neurite outgrowth, substrates exhibiting a grating pattern of nanorods were partially collapsed by the pulling force of water, leaving few nanorods, which support the net form of laminin on the surface. Furthermore, we fabricated the topological nanostructure-patterned wafer coated with laminin and successfully manipulated the extension and direction of neurites by using more than 80 pin of a single soma. This approach demonstrates potential as a facile and efficient method for guiding the direction of single axons and for enhancing neurite outgrowth in studies on nerve regenerative medicine.

ABSTRACT: First-principles calculations are carried out to systematically investigate the structural and electronic properties of point defects in hydrogenated GaBi and InBi monolayers, including vacancies, antisites and Stone-Wales (SW) defects. Our results imply that the perfect H-2-Ga(In) Bi is a semiconductor with a bandgap of 0.241 eV (0.265 eV) at the Gamma point. The system turns into a metal by introducing a Ga(In) vacancy, substituting a Bi with a Ga(In) atom or substituting an In with a Bi atom. Other defect configurations can tune the bandgap value in the range from 0.09 eV to 0.3 eV. In particular, the exchange of neighboring Ga(In) and Bi increases the bandgap, meanwhile the spin splitting effect is preserved. All SW defects decrease the bandgap. The lowest formation energy of defects occurs when substituting a Ga(In) with a Bi atom and the values of SW defects vary from 0.98 eV to 1.77 eV.

ABSTRACT: We demonstrate a Q-switched Erbium-doped fiber laser (EDFL) using a molybdenum disulfide (MoS2)-based saturable absorber (SA) as a Q-switcher. The SA is prepared from commercial available MoS2 pristine flakes with final solution concentration of similar to 0.02mg/ ml. The Q-switcher is assembled by depositing a dried MoS2 onto a fiber ferule facet before it is matched with another clean ferrule via a connector. By increasing the pump power from 120 mW to 160 mW, stable generation of Q-switched EDFL incorporating MoS2 SA has been obtained at 1502 nm wavelength. The pulse repetition rate also varies from 45.2 kHz to 66.0 kHz with pulse width which is increased from 2.73 mu s to 3.19 mu s. At pump power of 160 mW, we successfully generated the maximum average output power of 0.51 mW, corresponding to a pulse energy of 7.8 nJ.

ABSTRACT: In vehicular networks, high mobility and limited transmission range of Road-Side Units (RSU) cause dynamic topological changes and result with interference occurred by transmission of vehicles. Moreover, due to the limited bandwidth of IEEE 802.11p based vehicular communication, providing a fair share of network resources among vehicles is essential for an efficient network management. Therefore, flow and interference management challenges cause a degradation in percentage of flow satisfied by effecting quality of communication and enhancing interference in vehicular networks. These aforementioned two challenges can be mitigated with Software-Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm where a centralized controller can schedule data flows and then coordinate power level of vehicles. Hence, in this paper, the cooperation of SDN and IEEE 802.11p based vehicular communication has been proposed in vehicular networks. We present a novel software-defined flow and power management model implemented into controller. Here, we classify vehicles based on Quality of Experience (QoE) and model RSUs with a queuing theoretic approach. Then the proposed model is used to detect unsatisfactory vehicles and estimate effective and accurate amount of transmission power of these vehicles so that unsatisfactory vehicles will be served a new assigned RSU with optimal signal level. Moreover, we redefine flow label field in OpenFlow flow table so that controller can manage to RSUs by imposing some behaviors. Numerical results show how a better flow satisfied can be maintained by implementing this idea.

ABSTRACT: Fiber lasers are widely used in industrial processing, sensing, medical and communications applications due to their simple structure, good stability and low cost. With the rapid development of fiber lasers and the sustained improvement of industrial laser quality requirements, researchers in ultrafast optics focus on how to get laser pulses with high output power and narrow pulse duration. Q-switched technology is one of the most effective techniques to generate ultrashort pulses. In this paper, a tungsten diselenide saturable absorber with 16.82% modulation depth is prepared by chemical vapor deposition. Experimental results show that when the pump power changes from 115.7 mW to 630 mW, the all-fiber laser can achieve a stable Q-switched pulse output. The repetition rate of the output pulse varies from 80.32 kHz to 204.2 kHz, the pulse duration is 581 ns, the maximum output power is 17.1 mW and the maximum pulse energy is 83.7 nJ. Results in this paper show that tungsten diselenide can be applied to ultrafast optics, which is a kind of saturable absorption material with excellent properties.

ABSTRACT: Pure liquids in thermodynamic equilibrium are structurally homogeneous. In liquid crystals, flow and light pulses are used to create reconfigurable domains with polar order. Moreover, through careful engineering of concerted microfluidic flows and localized optothermal fields, it is possible to achieve complete control over the nucleation, growth, and shape of such domains. Experiments, theory, and simulations indicate that the resulting structures can be stabilized indefinitely, provided the liquids are maintained in a controlled nonequilibrium state. The resulting sculpted liquids could find applications in microfluidic devices for selective encapsulation of solutes and particles into optically active compartments that interact with external stimuli.

ABSTRACT: We investigate the focusing properties of a femtosecond vortex light pulse focused by a high numerical aperture objective. By using the Richards-Wolf vectorial diffraction method, the intensity distribution, the velocity variation and the orbital angular momentum near the focus are studied in great detail. We have discovered that the femtosecond vortex light pulse can travel at various speeds, that is, slower or faster than light with a tight focusing system. Moreover, we have found that the numerical aperture of the focusing objective and the duration of the vortex light pulse will influence the orbital angular momentum distribution in the focused field.

ABSTRACT: By combining a spiral zone plate (SZP) and a grating, we propose a single optical element, termed a composited spiral zone plate grating (CSZPG), to generate flower mode vortices with the equicohesive petals and has long focal depths. Theoretical analysis reveals that the CSZPG can generate flower mode vortices with approximately equicohesive petals, and that it has longer focal depths compared with the conventional SZP. Moreover, the performance of the CSZPG on the period, focal length and radius is investigated. The experimental results are also presented, agreeing well with the theoretical predictions. The unique characteristics of the proposed CSZPG make it attractive for many applications such as particle trapping and optical imaging.

ABSTRACT: We propose an effective method to measure the orbital angular momentum of a perfect optical vortex (POV) beam with a hybrid angular gradient phase grating (HAG-PG), which is a gradient grating with angular changing distribution. The HAG-PG performs the transformation from the POV to the dark stripes of the diffraction intensity patterns. From the number and the orientation of dark stripes of far-field diffraction patterns formed by the HAG-PG, the modulus of TC and sign of the incident POV beam can be determined. The high scalability of this method for being unrestricted by the Fourier plane and its adaptation for measuring the POV beams with different states are demonstrated by loading the HAG-PG hologram on a spatial light modulator. And the detection sensitivity of the POV beam can be significantly improved. The experimental results agree well with the theoretical simulations.

ABSTRACT: Herein, the generation of an optical vortex array dubbed the flower-shaped optical vortex array (FOVA) is proposed and experimentally demonstrated using a single optical path interference method. FOVA is generated by the superposition of even and odd Ince-Gaussian (IG) beams, which have the same degree m and different order p. The number of optical vortices (OVs) in the FOVA is determined based on the values of order p and degree m of the even and odd IG beams. Furthermore, the positive sign of the OVs in the array can be transformed to negative by adding a specific initial phase difference. The OVs vanish and then recover as the initial phase difference increases from 0 to 2 pi. Moreover, the gradient force and energy flow distribution of the FOVA are studied. The OVA with flower-shaped structure generated herein has potential significance in applications, such as microparticle manipulation and optical measurements.

ABSTRACT: We demonstrate a stable hybrid Q-switched Er-doped fiber (EDF) laser with WS2 as the saturable absorber (SA). The SA device is obtained by depositing WS2 on a tapered fiber using the pulsed laser deposition method. The modulation depth of the SA is 8.0%, the nonsaturable loss is 30%, and the saturation intensity is 200 MW/cm(2). By combining the saturable absorption of fiber-taper WS2 and the effect of nonlinear polarization rotation, the Q-switched EDF laser is achieved with a pulse duration of 443 ns and average power of 43 mW. The repetition rate can be adjustable among 235-365 KHz. To our best knowledge, both pulse duration and output power are the best results among Q-switched EDF lasers with transition mental dichalcogenide materials like SAs. These results indicate that the proposed hybrid Q-switched EDF laser performs better to achieve shorter pulses with higher power in the future.

ABSTRACT: By using the ultrasound-assisted liquid phase exfoliation method, Bi2Te3 nanosheets are synthesized and deposited onto a quartz plate to form a kind of saturable absorber (SA), in which nonlinear absorption properties around 2 mu m are analyzed with a home-made mode-locked laser. With the as-prepared Bi2Te3 SA employed, a stable passively Q-switched all-solid-state 2 mu m laser is successfully realized. Q-switched pulses with a maximum average output power of 2.03 W are generated under an output coupling of 5%, corresponding to the maximum single-pulse energy of 18.4 mu J and peak power of 23 W. The delivered shortest pulse duration and maximum repetition rate are 620 ns and 118 kHz under an output coupling of 2%, respectively. It is the first presentation of such Bi2Te3 SA employed in a solid-state Q-switched crystalline laser at 2 mu m, to the best of our knowledge. In comparison with other 2D materials suitable for pulsed 2 mu m lasers, the saturable absorption performance of Bi2Te3 SA is proved to be promising in generating high power and high-repetition-rate 2 mu m laser pulses.

ABSTRACT: Conventional Q-switched fiber lasers operating at multi-longitudinal-mode oscillation usually suffer from self-mode-locking-induced temporal instability, relatively strong noise, and low coherence. Here, we address the challenge through demonstrating, for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, a single-longitudinal-mode (SLM) Er-doped fiber (EDF) laser passively Q-switched by a few-layer Bi2Se3 saturable absorber (SA). The Bi2Se3 SA prepared by the liquid-phase exfoliation method shows a modulation depth of similar to 5% and saturation optical intensity of 1.8 MW/cm(2). A section of 1-m unpumped EDF together with a 0.06-nm-bandwidth fiber Bragg grating is used as an ultra-narrow autotracking filter to realize SLM oscillation. Stable SLM Q-switching operation at 1.55 mu m is successfully achieved with the spectral linewidth as narrow as 212 kHz and the pulse duration of 2.54 mu s, manifesting near-transform-limited pulses with a time-bandwidth product of 0.53. In particular, we found that the SLM Q-switching possesses the higher signal-to-noise ratios of 62 dB (optical) and 48 dB (radio frequency), exhibiting its advantages of low noise and high stability. Such an SLM Q-switched fiber laser could gain great interest for some applications in coherent detection, coherent optical communications, and high-sensitivity optical sensing.

ABSTRACT: We report an erbium-doped fiber laser passively Q-switched by a few-layer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) saturable absorber (SA). The few-layer MoS2 is grown by the chemical vapor deposition method and transferred onto the end-face of a fiber connector to form a fiber-compatible MoS2 SA. The laser cavity is constructed by using a three-port optical circulator and a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) as the two end-mirrors. Stable Q-switched pulses are obtained with a pulse duration of 1.92 mu s at 1560.5 nm. By increasing the pump power from 42 to 204 mW, the pulse repetition rate can be widely changed from 28.6 to 114.8 kHz. Passive Q-switching operations with discrete lasing wavelengths ranging from 1529.8 to 1570.1 nm are also investigated by using FBGs with different central wavelengths. This work demonstrates that few-layer MoS2 can serve as a promising SA for wideband-tunable Q-switching laser operation. (C) 2015 Chinese Laser Press

ABSTRACT: Deposition of two-dimensional (2D) MoS2 materials on the tapered fiber allows various photonic applications including saturable absorbers and four-wave mixing. Ethanol catalytic deposition (ECD) of MoS2 on the optical tapered fiber was proposed and demonstrated in this work. Different from the conventional optical driven deposition using water or organic solvent, the ECD method utilized the high volatility of the ethanol solvent, which significantly increased the movement speed of the MoS2 nanosheets and thus boosted the deposition rate and reduced the minimum power threshold to drive the deposition. We believe the ECD method should be able to be applied to other similar 2D materials such as other types of transition metal chalcogenides. (C) 2015 Chinese Laser Press

ABSTRACT: The Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) and Hermite-Gaussian (HG) modes can be interconverted with an astigmatism phase. In this paper, based on the single beam, the interconversion of LG and HG beams array with the astigmatism phase is analyzed theoretically and the spatial mapping relationship is derived. In the experiment, 1 x 3, 2 x 2, 3 x 3 LG beams arrays are generated and converted into HG beams array via employing a spatial light modulator loaded with 0 degrees, 90 degrees, 45 degrees, -45 degrees astigmatism phases. The experimental results are in great agreement with the theoretical analyses. Moreover, from the number and direction of the dark fringe of converted HG beams array, the orbital angular momentum information of LG beams array can be obtained. This work theoretically perfects the theoretical model of the interconversion between LG and HG beams based on an astigmatism phase, and also provides a theoretical support for measuring the LG beams array.

ABSTRACT: We demonstrate passive Q-switching in a 2 mu m region by integrating Bismuth (III) Telluride (Bi2Te3) embedded in Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA). Bi2Te3 was embedded in PVA by a solution casting approach to develop a Bi2Te3-PVA film and integrated in the laser cavity with a ring configuration to generate a pulse laser. The experimental works show that the proposed passive saturable absorber operates at input pump power ranges from 637mW to 784mW with a central wavelength of 1957.6nm. We observed a tunable repetition rate from 12.6kHz to 26.1kHz with the shortest pulse width of 2.22 mu s. The laser produces maximum instantaneous output peak power and pulse energy of 0.42W and 0.94 mu J, respectively.

ABSTRACT: We demonstrate that ferroferric-oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles exhibit nonlinear saturable absorption property at 1.55 mu m, and fabricate two filmy saturable absorbers by embedding the nanoparticles into a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) film or polyimide (PI) film separately. In the Fe3O4-PVA (Fe3O4-PI) Q-switched fiber laser, the pulse repetition rate increases from 8.5 kHz (5.5 kHz) to 28 kHz (49 kHz) and the pulse duration decreases from 23.5 mu s (47 mu s) to 6 mu s (3.5 mu s) by varying the pump power from 25 mW (23 mW) to 150 mW (650 mW). Experiment results indicate that PI-based saturable absorbers can afford larger powers than PVA-based saturable absorbers, which can be attributed to the higher fusion point of the PI film. The Fe3O4-PI saturable absorber exhibits features of high damage threshold, low cost, and good flexibility, which could be applied in fields of near-infrared pulse generation and frequency conversions.

ABSTRACT: It is commonly believed that optical activity (OA) is manifested mainly in chiral media, but rare in non-chiral structures. Here, an analog of OA in free space is experimentally demonstrated by using a single liquid-crystal Pancharatnam-Berry phase element (PBPE), for which the mechanism is highly consistent with that of the traditional OA. The specifically designed PBPE supports the direction-dependent polarization rotation of a Bessel beam with controllable rotatory power. Such a polarization rotation can be revoked by another PBPE with the same structure. Unlike in a chiral medium, this scheme shows simultaneous realization of equivalent leverotation and dextorotation merely by switching the optical element orientation, promising for applications non-magnetic optical devices such as optical isolators.

ABSTRACT: It has been shown theoretically and numerically that in the sharp focus of a circularly polarized optical vortex, the longitudinal component of the spin angular momentum vector is inverted. Moreover, if the input light to the optical system is left-hand circularly polarized, it has been shown to be right-hand polarized in the focus near the optical axis. Since this effect occurs near the focus where a backward energy flow takes place, such an inversion of the spin angular momentum can be used to detect the backward energy flow.

ABSTRACT: Electromagnetic fields interacting with microscopic structural features in a composite material provide emerging optical properties that surpass those offered by the individual components. However, composite materials can be generally lossy due to the scattering effects induced by inhomogeneities at the interfaces between different compounds. To overcome such problems, complicated and costly manufacturing procedures, such as top-down approaches, are generally required. In contrast, here ZnO-ZnWO4 eutectic self-organized composites grown by the micropulling method are considered, displaying sharp and strongly polarized transmission at 397 nm. Such an optical response is notable because it is not observed in either ZnO or ZnWO4 single crystals. The optical response is due to the refractive index matching of the two constituents, which self-organize into ordered structures via a micropulling down method. The optical behavior reported here can directly lead to applications, such as tunable narrowband filters with bandpass of 3 nm and polarizers, paving the way to a new self-organization route for manufacturing optical components.

ABSTRACT: We propose and demonstrate a widely tunable passively Q-switched Ho3+/Pr3+-codoped ZrF4-BaF2-LaF3-AlF3-NaF fiber laser operating in the 2.8 mu m mid-infrared (MIR) waveband based on a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) saturable absorber (SA). The SWCNTs have diameters ranging from 1.4 to 1.7 nm. The modulation depth and saturation intensity of the SWCNT SA measured at 2850 nm are 16.5% and 1.66 MW/cm(2), respectively. Stable Q-switched pulses with the shortest pulse duration of 1.46 mu s and the maximum pulse energy of 0.43 mu J are achieved at a launched pump power of 445.6 mW. The combined use of a broadband SWCNT SA and a plane ruled grating ensures a broad continuously tuning range of 55.0 nm from 2837.6 to 2892.6 nm. The output powers, emission spectra, repetition rates, and pulse durations at different tuning wavelengths are also characterized and analyzed. Our results indicate that SWCNTs can be excellent broadband SAs in the 3 mu m MIR region. To the author's knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a widely tunable carbon-nanotube-enabled passively Q-switched fiber laser operating in the 2.8 mu m MIR waveband.

ABSTRACT: We report a passively Q-switched and mode-locked erbium-doped fiber laser (EDFL) based on PtSe2, a new two-dimensional material, as a saturable absorber (SA). Self-started Q-switching at 1560 nm in the EDFL was achieved at a threshold pump power of 65 mW, and at the maximum pump power of 450 mW, the maximum single Q-switched pulse energy is 143.2 nJ. Due to the polarization-dependent characteristics of the PtSe2-based SA, the laser can be switched from the Q-switched state to the mode-locked state by adjusting the polarization state. A mode-locked pulse train with a repetition rate of 23.3 MHz and a pulse width of 1.02 ps can be generated when the pump power increases to about 80 mW, and the stable mode-locked state is maintained until the pump power reaches its maximum 450 mW. The maximum single mode-locked pulse energy is 0.53 nJ. This is the first time to our knowledge that successful generation of stable Q-switched and mode-locked pulses in an Er-doped fiber laser has been obtained by using PtSe2 as a saturable absorber.

ABSTRACT: Interacting with an evanescent wave, an achiral particle can experience a lateral optical force (LOF) in a direction which is perpendicular to that of the illuminating photon momentum while the system apparently has the left-right symmetry. Here, using the Cartesian multipole expansion theory, a general relationship between LOF and spin and momentum is established. Most importantly, it is demonstrated that an anomalous LOF exerted on an isotropic achiral particle of arbitrary size and composition is proportional to the optical transverse spin in the incident evanescent wave that carries pure transverse spin associated with spin-momentum locking. Manifesting itself as a mechanical consequence of the Berry phase effect, this anomalous LOF suggests a direct detectability of the transverse spin of light, as well as mimicking the transverse shift of light in the spin Hall effect of photons.

ABSTRACT: We report an atmospheric multichannel data transmission system with channel separation by vortex beams of various orders, including half-integer values. For the demultiplexing of the communication channels, a multichannel diffractive optical element (DOE) is proposed, being matched with the used vortex beams. The considered approach may be realized without digital processing of the output images, but only based on the numbers of informative diffraction orders, similar to sorting. The system is implemented based on two spatial light modulators (SLMs), one of which forms a multiplexed signal on the transmitting side, and the other implements a multichannel DOE for separating the vortex beams on the receiving side. The stability of the communication channel to atmospheric interference and the crosstalk between the channels are investigated.

ABSTRACT: The utilization of orbital angular momentum (OAM) in light for information encoding is a promising avenue, as it exhibits resilience against environmental disturbances. However, the direct detection of OAM poses a significant challenge due to beam distortion during transmission, which ultimately limits the practical application of OAM-based optical communication. We propose an environmentally friendly and intuitive detection method based on optical differentiation using a weak-measurement system. Optical differential measurements were conducted on LaguerreGaussian beams (L-G beams) with l = 5 and l = 8 to validate the feasibility of this approach. This approach mitigates the impact of disturbances on OAM measurement, enabling direct detection through a simplified system, which serves as a valuable reference for utilizing OAM as an information carrier in free-space optical communication.

ABSTRACT: Here, we used the micro P-scan method to investigate the saturated absorption (SA) of different layered Bi2Se3 continuous films. Through resonance excitation, first, we studied the influence of the second surface state (SS) on SA. The second SS resonance excitation (similar to 2.07 eV) resulted in a free carrier cross section that was 4 orders of magnitude larger than usual. At the same time, we found that the fast relaxation process of the massless Dirac electrons is much shorter than that of electrons in bulk states. Moreover, the second SS excitation resonance reduced the saturation intensity. Second, we studied the effect of the thickness on the SA properties of materials. The results showed that the saturation intensity was positively correlated to the thickness, the same as the modulation depth, and the thicker the Bi2Se3 film was, the less the second SS would influence it. This work demonstrated that by using Bi2Se3 as a saturable absorber through changing the thickness or excitation wavelength, a controllable SA could be achieved. (C) 2018 Chinese Laser Press

ABSTRACT: A compact saturable absorber mirror (SAM) based on few-layer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanoplatelets was fabricated and successfully used as an efficient saturable absorber (SA) for the passively Q-switched solid-state laser at 1 mu m wavelength. Pulses as short as 182 ns were obtained from a ytterbium-doped (Yb:LGGG) bulk laser Q-switched by the MoS2 SAM, which we believe to be the shortest one ever achieved from the MoS2 SAs-based Q-switched bulk lasers. A maximum average output power of 0.6 W was obtained with a slope efficiency of 24%, corresponding to single pulse energy up to 1.8 mu J. In addition, the simultaneous dual-wavelength Q-switching at 1025.2 and 1028.1 nm has been successfully achieved. The results indicate the promising potential of few-layer MoS2 nanoplatelets as nonlinear optical switches for achieving efficient pulsed bulk lasers. (C) 2015 Chinese Laser Press

ABSTRACT: Spontaneous vortex nucleation is a universal feature of open and nonlinear physical systems. We investigate theoretically vortex rings and vortex lines emerging during propagation of self-trapped wave beams in nonlocal nonlinear media. We demonstrate how radially perturbed fundamental solitons exhibit extremely robust and long-lived oscillations with the spontaneous generation of a regular set of vortex rings at the wave beam periphery. We find numerically a class of cylindrically symmetric higher-order spatial solitons and investigate their stability and nonlinear dynamics. The formation of external vortex rings, similar to fundamental soliton, is accompanied by emergence of additional internal vortex-antivortex pairs nucleating from the edge-ring phase dislocation of perturbed higher-order soliton.

ABSTRACT: "Manipulating angular momentum of light relies on the change of geometric phase in anisotropic nanostructures or optical interface phenomena. Spin-orbit interactions demonstrated in normal incidence at a planar isotropic interface are conditioned by Brewster reflection, limited to the light beam with a single radial frequency in the k-space. This study demonstrates a geometric (Pancharatnam-Berry) phase that overcomes Brewster angle limitations providing high variability in the modulation of light reflected from a planar isotropic interface. The examined geometric phase stems from the reflection anisotropy imitating the structural anisotropy of photoaligned liquid crystals and photonic metasurfaces. Using a geometric-phase modulation of tightly focused light reflected from a glass slab, three modes of spin to orbital angular momentum conversion are demonstrated. The discovered reflective spin-orbit interaction allows for design of a double-helix focusing sensor to be used in microscopy imaging for precise depth measurements (accuracy 109 nm and precision 7 nm in the range of 8 & mu m). Experiments with a focused astigmatic beam prove that a glass plate can perform very complex modulation of the geometric phase using illumination structuring. The results thus provide the foundation for the design of low-cost geometric-phase systems relying on the space-variant reflection anisotropy."

ABSTRACT: We demonstrate an experimental study on the influence of the parameters of a graphene-based saturable absorber (SA) on the performance of mode-locked Er- and Tm-doped fiber lasers. We have fabricated a set of saturable absorbers with different number of graphene layers: 9, 12, 24, 37 and 48. Each SA was characterized in terms of nonlinear optical parameters (modulation depth, saturation intensity, saturation fluence) and tested in two state-of-the-art, low-power Er-and Tm-doped fiber lasers. Our results show, that in the Er-laser the broadest output spectrum (11 nm) and shortest pulses (345 fs) are generated using 37 layers of graphene in the SA. In case of a Tm-laser, the best performance (737 fs pulses with 5.82 nm bandwidth) was achieved with 24 layers. Additionally, we show that the modulation depth of a 9-layer SA is insufficient to initiate mode-locking in both lasers. This is the first reported comprehensive study on controlling of the parameters of a SA by scaling the number of graphene layers. (C)2015 Optical Society of America

ABSTRACT: Dynamic manipulation of the spin of photons is important for many applications ranging from optical sensing to optical information processing. In the past, the study on controlling the spin of light has focused on chiral materials, three-dimensional structures lacking any mirror symmetries. However, the complexity of fabrication of such structures has hindered their practical applications. In this work, the dynamic switching of optical chirality in two-dimensional honeycomb photonic crystal-the so-called photonic graphene is explored. In particular, optical spin-spin interaction mediated by the pseudospin states of the photonic graphene is proposed. A circularly polarized pumping beam can lift the degeneracy at the Dirac cones, leading to chiral responses for a probe beam incident along the direction of the Dirac points. Interestingly, the chirality is determined by the both the valley index and the spin of the pumping beam. The proposed nonlinear photonic graphene offers a new route to manipulate valley- and spin-dependent phenomena in 2D photonic systems.

ABSTRACT: Diverse spatial mode bases can be exploited in mode-division multiplexing (MDM) to sustain the capacity growth in fiber-optic communications, such as linearly polarized (LP) modes, vector modes, LP orbital angular momentum (LP-OAM) modes, and circularly polarized OAM (CP-OAM) modes. Nevertheless, which kind of mode bases is more appropriate to be utilized in fiber still remains unclear. Here, we aim to find the superior mode basis in MDM fiber-optic communications via a system-level comparison in air-core fiber (ACF). We first investigate the walk-off effect of four spatial mode bases over 1-km ACF, where LP and LP-OAM modes show intrinsic mode walk-off, while it is negligible for vector and CP-OAM modes. We then study the mode coupling effect of degenerate vector and CP-OAM modes over 1-km ACF under fiber perturbations, where degenerate even and odd vector modes suffer severe mode cross talk, while negligible for high-order degenerate CP-OAM modes based on the laws of angular momentum conservation. Moreover, we comprehensively evaluate the system-level performance for data-carrying single-channel and two-channel MDM transmission with different spatial mode bases under various kinds of fiber perturbations (bending, twisting, pressing, winding, and out-of-plane moving). The obtained results indicate that the CP-OAM mode basis shows superiority compared to other mode bases in MDM fiber-optic communications without using multiple-input multiple-output digital signal processing. Our findings may pave the way for robust short-reach MDM optical interconnects for data centers and high-performance computing.

ABSTRACT: Rhenium disulfide (ReS2), a member of group VII transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), has attracted increasing attention because of its unique distorted 1T structure and electronic and optical properties, which are much different from those of group VI TMDs (MoS2, WS2, MoSe2, WSe2, etc.). It has been proved that bulk ReS2 behaves as a stack of electronically and vibrationally decoupled monolayers, which offers remarkable possibilities to prepare a monolayer ReS2 facilely and offers a novel platform to study photonic properties of TMDs. However, due to the large and layer-independent bandgap, the nonlinear optical properties of ReS2 from the visible to mid-infrared spectral range have not yet been investigated. Here, the band structure of ReS2 with the introduction of defects is simulated by the ab initio method, and the results indicate that the bandgap can be reduced from 1.38 to 0.54 eV with the introduction of defects in a suitable range. In the experiment, using a bulk ReS2 with suitable defects as the raw material, a few-layered broadband ReS2 saturable absorber (SA) is prepared by the liquid phase exfoliation method. Using the as-prepared ReS2 SA, passively Q-switched solid-state lasers at wavelengths of 0.64, 1.064, and 1.991 mu m are investigated systematically. Moreover, with cavity design, a femtosecond passively mode-locked laser at 1.06 mu m is successfully realized based on the as-prepared ReS2 SA for the first time. The results present a promising alternative for a rare broadband optical modulator and indicate the potential of ReS2 in generating Q-switched and mode-locked pulsed lasers. It is further anticipated that this work may be helpful for the design of 2D optoelectronic devices with variable bandgaps. (c) 2018 Chinese Laser Press

ABSTRACT: We demonstrate a passively Q-switched erbium-doped fiber laser (EDFL) based on few-layer MoS2 as a saturable absorber (SA). Few-layer MoS2 is prepared by the chemical vapor deposition method. The prepared MoS2 is transferred onto the end face of a fiber connector to form a fiber-compatible MoS2-based SA. The saturation intensity and modulation depth of the MoS2 SA are measured to be 0.43 MW/cm(2) and 33.2%, respectively. The Q-switched EDFL has an all-fiber linear cavity with two fiber Bragg gratings as the end mirrors. By inserting the MoS2 SA into the laser cavity, stable Q-switched operation is achieved at 1.55 mu m. The laser has a pump threshold of 20.4 mW, a pulse repetition rate tunable from 10.6 to 173.1 kHz, and a minimum pulse duration of 1.66 mu s. Our results show that few-layer MoS2 is a promising SA for Q-switching laser operation.

ABSTRACT: Optical cryptosystems mostly use spatial distributions of amplitude, phase, and polarization of light to encrypt two-dimensional data/image. In this letter, we demonstrate the use of light carrying an array of optical vortices for image encryption. Spatially concatenated orthogonal states of optical vortices allow high-dimensional encoding and minimize the quality degradation during practical implementation. These features offer an efficient way to design an optical cryptosystem.

ABSTRACT: Ultra-intense femtosecond vortex pulses can provide an opportunity to investigate the new phenomena with orbital angular momentum (OAM) involved in extreme cases. This paper reports a high gain optical vortex amplifier for intense femtosecond vortex pulses generation. Traditional regeneration amplifiers can offer high gain for Gaussian mode pulses but cannot amplify optical vortex pulses while maintaining the phase singularity because of mode competition. Here, we present a regeneration amplifier with a ring-shaped pump. By controlling the radius of the pump, the system can realize the motivation of the Laguerre-Gaussian [LG(0,1()(-1)())] mode and the suppression of the Gaussian mode. Without seeds, the amplifier has a donut-shaped output containing two opposite OAM states simultaneously, as our prediction by simulation. If seeded by a pulse of a topologic charge of 1 or 1, the system will output an amplified LG(0,1(-1)) mode pulse with the same topologic charge as the seed. To our knowledge, this amplifier can offer the highest gain as 1.45 x 10(6) for optical vortex amplification. Finally, we obtain a 1.8 mJ, 51 fs compressed optical vortex seeded from a 2 nJ optical vortex. (C) 2020 Chinese Laser Press

ABSTRACT: In this paper, both nonlinear saturable absorption and two-photon absorption (TPA) of few-layer molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2) were observed at 1.56 mu m wavelength and further applied to mode-locked ultrafast fiber laser for the first time to our knowledge. Few-layer MoSe2 nanosheets were prepared by liquid-phase exfoliation method and characterized by x ray diffractometer, Raman spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy. The obtained few-layer MoSe2 dispersion is further composited with a polymer material for convenient fabrication of MoSe2 thin films. Then, we investigated the nonlinear optical (NLO) absorption property of the few-layer MoSe2 film using a balanced twin-detector measurement technique. Both the saturable absorption and TPA effects of the few-layer MoSe2 film were found by increasing the input optical intensity. The saturable absorption shows a modulation depth of 0.63% and a low nonsaturable loss of similar to 3.5%, corresponding to the relative modulation depth of 18%. The TPA effect occurred when the input optical intensity exceeds similar to 260 MW/cm(2). Furthermore, we experimentally exploit the saturable absorption of few-layer MoSe2 film to mode lock an all-fiber erbium-doped fiber laser. Stable soliton mode locking at 1558 nm center wavelength is achieved with pulse duration of 1.45 ps. It was also observed that the TPA process suppresses the mode-locking operation in the case of higher optical intensity. Our results indicate that layered MoSe2, as another two-dimensional nanomaterial, can provide excellent NLO properties (e.g., saturable absorption and TPA) for potential applications in ultrashort pulse generation and optical limiting.

ABSTRACT: We demonstrate for the first time to our knowledge the use of Fe3O4 nanopartides for -switching a tunable mid-infrared (Mid-IR) Dy3+-doped ZBLAN fiber laser around 3 mu m. The Q-switcher was fabricated by depositing the prepared Fe3O4 nanopartides solution onto an Au mirror. Its nonlinear optical response was characterized using a mode locked Ho3+/Pr3+-codoped ZBLAN fiber laser at 2.87 mu m, and showed a modulation depth of 11.9% as well as a saturation intensity of 1.44 MW/cm(2). Inserting the device into a tunable Dy3+-doped ZBLAN fiber laser, stable Q-switched pulses within the tunable range of 2812.4-3031.6 tun were obtained. When tuning the wavelength to 2931.2 nm, a maximum Q-switching output power of 111.0 mW was achieved with a repetition rate of 123.0 kHz and a pulse width of 1.25 mu s. The corresponding pulse energy was 0.90 mu J. This demonstration suggests that Fe3O4 nanoparticles are a promising broadband saturable absorption material for mid-infrared operation.

ABSTRACT: Significance Optical spin-orbit coupling is ubiquitous in nanoscale light-matter interactions. An in-depth study of these phenomena not only contributes to the discovery of new optical phenomena but also provides many opportunities for developing new technologies for light manipulation. In recent years, planar photonic devices such as geometric phase metasurfaces have shown many attractive applications, including multi-wavelength spin-dependent wavefront steering, spin-polarized photon generation, and spin-polarized thermal light emission. Most of these functions are achieved based on particularly designed nanostructures with certain types of spatial symmetry breaking, which aims to manipulate light in a subwavelength resolution and spin bases. In comparison, the interactions between light and disordered micro- and nanostructures also begin to catch our attention. However, the inherent randomness of disordered structures has made the research on spin-orbit coupling effects quite challenging, as stochastic processes must be considered in a statistic manner. Particularly, the emerging photonic spin Hall effect in random systems has not yet been fully understood. For instance, even though random geometric phase fluctuations and random vortices can both induce a photonic spin Hall effect, they have distinct physics origins. Thus, the underlined physics of the photonic spin split effects from different disordered geometric phases remains to be explored. This paper introduces the basic concept of the spin of light and spin-orbit coupling phenomena in different micro- and nano-optical systems and then focuses on analyzing the spin split effects of two-dimensional random systems, including anisotropic disorder, magneto-optical fluctuations, vortices, and random dipole radiation. Meanwhile, we attempt to utilize the photonic spin Hall effect in disordered systems as a potential means to precisely detect and manipulate two-dimensional magnetic and thermodynamic systems for the sensing and control of phase transition phenomena. Progress A typical result of optical spin-orbit coupling is the photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE), which describes the spatial split between light that carries opposite spins. For example, PSHE occurs when a polarized Gaussian beam is reflected or refracted at the air-dielectric material interface [Fig. 2(b)]. It also emerges when the propagation direction of a polarized paraxial light is slowly changing in free space, where the light polarization will rotate accordingly. In 2009, Bliokh et al. coupled a paraxial beam into a cylindrical glass and realized a spiral trajectory of light through continuous total internal reflections on the inner surface of the cylindrical glass. The separation of spin-up and spin-down components of light is gradually amplified by accumulating geometric phases during this progress, and a PSHE was finally observed. In 2015, it was also demonstrated that the spin-momentum locking in the evanescent wave exhibits an inherent quantum spin Hall effect of light, which is a unidirectional spin transfer phenomenon of light along the interface surface. Around 2001, Hasman's group developed a set of planar geometric phase optical elements by spatially-varying subwavelength grating structures called Pancharatnam-Berry phase optical element [Fig. 2(d)], which is the earliest version of the geometric phase metasurfaces. Currently, geometric phase metasurfaces have been widely applied to construct versatile planar photonic devices for spin-based light manipulation and detection. Nonparaxial beams sometimes can behave counterintuitively. For instance, it has long been thought that linearly polarized dipole radiation does not carry angular momentum. However, recent theories and experiments have shown that the near-field of linear polarized dipole radiation can have a spin texture [Fig. 2(j)], and this nearfield spin information can be observed through waveguide coupling or scattering processes of isotropic nanoparticles. The interaction between light and disordered structures can produce novel phenomena and unpredictable results. For instance, disorders can be engineered to eliminate laser speckles for better wavefront shaping. In 2021, it has also been shown that, through the design of disordered noise, the information capacity limit of traditional metasurfaces can be broken, and wavefront control with more polarization degrees of freedom can be obtained. In 2017, Maguid et al. reported on photonic spin-symmetry breaking and unexpected spin-optical transport phenomena arising from subwavelength-scale disordered geometric phase structures. Weak disorder induces a photonic spin Hall effect, which is observed via quantum weak measurements, whereas strong disorder leads to random spin-split modes in momentum space, which is called a random optical Rashba effect. As the geometric phase of the metasurface to the spin of light has the same mechanism as the Berry phase, a similar spin Hall effect can be produced in principle. In 2019, Wang et al. observed photonic topological defects of bound vortex pairs and unbound vortices generated from a two-dimensional array of nanoantennas, which is achieved by randomly inserting local deformations in the metasurfaces. The spin Hall effect of light is established based on discrete topological structures, or subwavelength vortex and antivortex pairs. Light does not carry an electric charge and therefore does not directly interact with the magnetic field, but a magnetized medium does affect the light propagation path. In 2020, Wang et al. studied a stochastic photonic spin Hall effect arising from space-variant Berry-Zak phases, which are generated by disordered magneto-optical effects. This spin shift is observed from a spatially bounded lattice of ferromagnetic meta-atoms displaying nanoscale disorders. A random variation of the radii of the meta-atoms induces the nanoscale fluctuation. This spin separation of light is in analogy to a Stern-Gerlach experiment, and photons of opposite spin are deflected into opposite directions as they interact with a magnetic material with random spatial gradients. The luminescence of quantum dots, 2D semiconductor materials, perovskite particles, and some atoms or molecules can be considered as dipole radiation randomly generated in time and space. Efficient polarization and phase control of this kind of radiation requires novel metasurfaces that have strong mode coupling between nanostructures. To achieve efficient control of randomly radiated dipoles [Fig. 11(d)], Rong et al. designed a geometric phase defective photonic crystal. The insertion of geometric phase structures into a photonic crystal that has a bandgap realizes many local defect modes. These defect modes not only achieve localized light emission but also select radiation polarization. Via tight-binding coupling between nanoantennas, the light emitted by each dipole can propagate to neighboring nanostructures to obtain a geometric phase accumulation that radiates into space with a predesigned spin-dependent momentum [Fig. 11(c)]. This configuration realizes efficiency polarization and momentum control of the light from random emitters. Conclusions and Prospects As we have witnessed over the past two decades, optical spin-orbit coupling is ubiquitous in many optical systems. An in-depth understanding of these phenomena not only contributes to basic physics understanding but also brings forth a diversity of applications. Nowadays, the development of nano-photonics enters a stage where higher information dimensionality, higher spatial-time resolution, and many other extreme conditions are required. One promising direction is utilizing high-quality factor metasurfaces that can manipulate the polarization and wavefront of light beyond lasers, such as thermal light and quantum emitters. The other direction is to combine spin-optics and nano-magnetism. In particular, magnetic phenomena, such as those in magnetic metasurfaces or artificial spin ice, can be potentially detected by PSHE and quantum weak measurement. Finally, an optical means is provided to detect and manipulate the magnetic ordering and phase transition in correlated physical systems.

ABSTRACT: We propose the generation of high-purity perfect cylindrical vector beams (PCVB) using the Fourier transformation of Bessel-Gauss vector beams. The demonstration of PCVBs is implemented via an interferometric method employing a spatial light modulator that allows a fully independent control of the ring diameter (RD) and ring width (RW) of the PCVB. The proposed scheme enables to generate different types of cylindrical vector beams with precise user-defined transverse dimensions. The dynamic control of the ring width, ring diameter, and the specific type of PCVBs desired is theoretically as well as experimentally demonstrated. The proposed experimental setup can not only be employed in the generation of arbitrary PCVB, but also in perfect vortex beams. The ability to generate fully tailorable cylindrical vector beams and vortex beams has implications for the efficient launch of exotic optical modes in specialty fibers, in the field of optical tweezers as well as for superresolution microscopy.

Recent progress in the realization and experimental characterization of such structures is presented and the theoretical tools to analyze the impact of real-world nonuniformities on the characteristics of fiber-microcoil structures are provided.

ABSTRACT: We have studied the broadband nonlinear optical properties of layered semiconductor Bi2O2Se prepared by the modified Bridgman method. The saturable absorber exhibits a modulation depth of 12.2%, a nonsaturable loss of 62.2%, and a saturable intensity of 26 MW/cm(2) at 1.55 mu m. With respect to 2-mu m band, the absorber shows a modulation depth of 9.1%, a nonsaturable loss of 71%, and a saturable intensity of 44.2 MW/cm(2). In addition, mode-locked Er-fiber laser and Q-switched Tm-fiber laser employing the saturable absorber were first demonstrated at 1.55 and 2 mu m, respectively. Our experimental results have revealed that the Bi2O2Se can be a promising broadband saturable absorber for pulsed lasers in the near-infrared range.

ABSTRACT: Real photon pairs can be created in a dynamic cavity with an oscillating boundary or temporally modulated refractive index of the constituent medium. This effect is called dynamic Casimir effect (DCE), which represents one of the most amazing predictions of quantum field theory. The DCE has been experimentally observed in Josephson metamaterials embedded in a microwave cavity. However, the efficiency of the observed DCE is extremely weak, entailing a complex external signal enhancement process to detect the signal. Here, it is shown that the DCE can be drastically enhanced in a dynamic 1D cavity consisting of a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID)-based Josephson transmission line with both temporal and spatial modulation on the effective inductance profile through flux-biasing. Such a system can resonantly generate photons at driving frequencies equal to even or odd integer times of that of the fundamental cavity mode governed by the symmetry of the spatial modulation. Interesting spectral and scaling behaviors for photons excited at the band edge are further observed. The discovery introduces a new degree of freedom-spatial modulation-to enhance the efficiency of DCE.

ABSTRACT: To enable new nonlinear responses, metamaterials are created by organizing structural units (meta-atoms), which are typically on the scale of about a hundred nanometres. However, truly altering the atomic symmetry and enabling new nonlinear responses requires control at the atomic scale, down to a few angstroms. Here we report three-dimensional nonlinear optical materials realized by the precise control and twist of individual two-dimensional van der Waals interfaces. Specifically, new nonlinear crystals are achieved by adding pseudo-screw symmetries to a multiple of four-layer WS2 stacks (for example, four layer, eight layer and so on). Nonlinear susceptibility and circular selectivity of the resulting three-dimensional crystals are fundamentally different from natural WS2, demonstrating a microscopic analogue to the fabrication of metamaterials with unique optical properties. Furthermore, we show that the magnitude of the newly enabled nonlinearity is enhanced by controlling the number of interfaces and the excitation wavelength. Our findings suggest a new approach to redesign the intrinsic nonlinearity in artificial atomic configurations, scalable from a few-nanometre-thick unit cells to bulk materials. Three-dimensional nonlinear optical metamaterials are realized by directly engineering the symmetries of electronic wavefunctions at the atomic scale by stacking individual two-dimensional van der Waals interfaces into a precisely designed three-dimensional configuration.

ABSTRACT: A compact pulsed Nd:LuAG laser at 1064 nm based on the self-Q-switching technique is reported, having the output power as high as 6.61 W at the incident pump power of 21.32 W, corresponding to the optical conversion efficiency of similar to 31%. The temporal width of the pulse was in the range from 532.2 to 652.6 ns, and the repetition rate varied between 488.6 and 551.9 kHz. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the self-Q-switching Nd:LuAG laser. With the nonlinear refractive index calculated to be 1.8 x 10(-19) m(2)/W, and the numerical simulation made with the modified rate equations, the Kerr lens effect was believed to be the reason for the self-Q-switching of Nd:LuAG. The compact cavity generating pulses with high output power and high repetition rate not only reveal that the self-Q-switching technique could be an efficient method for the generation of pulses with high output power and high repetition rate, but enrich the characteristics of Nd:LuAG crystal.

ABSTRACT: Ultrafast laser-induced thermalization-cooling of carriers in plasmonic nanostructures has been extensively explored in the development of high-speed photonic switches with a broad operating bandwidth. However, potential laser damage arising from the strong light-matter interaction remains a tremendous obstacle for practical applications of most colloidal processed plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs). Here, it is demonstrated that titanium nitride (TiN) NPs, with a broadband localized surface plasmon resonance in the near infrared (NIR) region, can be exploited as an ultrafast optical switch based on transient photo-bleaching, which manifests as a saturable absorption behavior with strong optical nonlinearity. The developed TiN-based optical switches exhibit high robustness against laser damage (up to peak power of 557 GW cm(-2)) and enable both Q-switched and transform-limited mode-locked pulse generation in the NIR spectral region in either fiber or solid-state lasers with pulse duration down to 763 fs. The results may stimulate further exploration of metal nitride materials for applications in nonlinear optics and ultrafast photonic devices.

ABSTRACT: Non-separable states of structured light have the analogous mathematical forms with quantum entanglement, which offer an effective way to simulate quantum process. However, the classical multi-partite non-separable states analogue to multi-particle entanglements can only be controlled by bulky free-space modulation of light through coupling multiple degrees of freedom (DoFs) with orbital angular momentum (OAM) to achieve high dimensionality and other DoFs to emulate multi-parties. In this paper, a scheme is proposed to directly emit multi-partite non-separable states from a simple laser cavity to mimic multi-particle quantum entanglement. Through manipulating three DoFs as OAM, polarization, and wavevector inside a laser cavity, the eight-dimensional (8D) tripartite states and all Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-like states can be generated and controlled on demand. In addition, an effective method is proposed to perform state tomography employing convolutional neural network (CNN), for measuring the generated GHZ-like states with highest fidelity up to 95.11%. This work reveals a feasibility of intra-cavity manipulation of high-dimensional multipartite non-separable states, opening a compact device for quantum-classical analogy and paving the path for advanced quantum scenarios. By introducing the spin-orbital coupling into a folded geometric cavity, a group of classical non-separable states with three degrees of freedom are generated and controlled directly from a laser. The high-dimensional non-separable laser states can fully emulate the three-particle entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, which are experimentally verified by a proposed quantum-like state tomography method to reconstruct density matrices and calculate fidelities, providing a compact at-the-source solution of high-dimensional quantum-classical simulations and informatics.image

ABSTRACT: We report on diode-pumped Er:Y2O3 ceramic lasers at about 2.7 mu m in the tunable continuous-wave, selfQ- switching and tungsten disulfide (WS2)-based passively Q-switching regimes. For stable self-Q-switched operation, the maximum output power reaches 106.6 mW under an absorbed power of 2.71 W. The shortest pulse width is measured to be about 1.39 mu s at a repetition rate of 26.7 kHz at maximum output. Using a spin-coated WS2 as a saturable absorber, a passively Q-switched Er:Y2O3 ceramic laser is also realized with a maximum average output power of 233.5 mW(for the first time, to the best of our knowledge). The shortest pulse width decreases to 0.72 mu s at a corresponding repetition rate of 29.4 kHz, which leads to a pulse energy of 7.92 mu J and a peak power of 11.0 W. By inserting an undoped YAG thin plate as a Fabry - Perot etalon, for the passive Q switching, wavelength tunings are also demonstrated at around 2710, 2717, 2727, and 2740 nm.

ABSTRACT: All light has structure, but only recently has it been possible to control it in all its degrees of freedom and dimensions, fuelling fundamental advances and applications alike. Here we review the recent advances in 'pushing the limits' with structured light, from traditional two-dimensional transverse fields towards four-dimensional spatiotemporal structured light and multidimensional quantum states, beyond orbital angular momentum towards control of all degrees of freedom, and beyond a linear toolkit to include nonlinear interactions, particularly for high-harmonic structured light. Using a simple interference argument, centuries old, we weave a story that highlights the common nature of seemingly diverse structures, presenting a modern viewpoint on the classes of structured light, and outline the possible future trends and open challenges. Recent effort in controlling the structure of light in all its degrees of freedom and dimensions has pushed the limits of structured light and broadened its potential beyond orbital angular momentum, two-dimensional fields, qubits and biphotons, and linear optical manipulation.

ABSTRACT: When metamaterial structures meet functional materials, what will happen? The recent rise of the combination of metamaterial structures and functional materials opens new opportunities for dynamic manipulation of terahertz wave. The optical responses of functional materials are greatly improved based on the highly-localized structures in metamaterials, and the properties of metamaterials can in turn be manipulated in a wide dynamic range based on the external stimulation. In the topical review, we summarize the recent progress of the functional materials-based metamaterial structures for flexible control of the terahertz absorption and polarization conversion. The reviewed devices include but are not limited to terahertz metamaterial absorbers with different characteristics, polarization converters, wave plates, and so on. We review the dynamical tunable metamaterial structures based on the combination with functional materials such as graphene, vanadium dioxide (VO2) and Dirac semimetal (DSM) under various external stimulation. The faced challenges and future prospects of the related researches will also be discussed in the end.

ABSTRACT: Significance Terahertz (THz) waves refer to electromagnetic waves within the frequency range of 0.1-10 THz, corresponding to wavelengths from 3 mm to 0.03 mm. THz techniques have found wide applications in fields such as materials science, non-destructive testing, biomedicine, security imaging, and next -generation communications, thus propelling the rapid development of THz photonics. However, whether in fundamental research or practical applications, effective manipulation of THz waves is essential to achieve functionalities such as frequency conversion, directional transmission, mode conversion, and phase control. Moreover, THz nonlinear effects are usually constrained by the electric field intensity and interaction distance.For ionic crystals, incident THz waves couple with optical phonons in the material to form stimulated phonon polaritons, which introduces a novel mechanism for the interaction between THz waves and crystal materials. Stimulated phonon polaritons hold the potential to effectively control and dominate the interaction between THz waves and crystals, and offer a theoretical basis and technical means for studying the nonlinear effects of THz waves in crystals, thereby opening up new possibilities for the development of strong -field THz science and technology. Therefore, it is crucial and necessary to summarize research advances of stimulated phonon polaritons.Progress This paper reviews the research progress of THz waves transmission modulation and nonlinear effects based on stimulated phonon polaritons. Firstly, after a brief introduction, the basic physical concepts and optical properties of phonon polaritons and stimulated phonon polaritons are introduced. With the influences of external input THz waves, stimulated phonon polaritons are excited, which are described by nonlinear Huang equations. In comparison with the spontaneous phonon polaritons described by classic Huang equations, the stimulated ones show mainly three differences: stronger intensity, more coherence, and delocalization. This is mathematically described by nonlinear Huang equations.Secondly, the three excitation methods of stimulated phonon polaritons and corresponding diagrams of experimental setups (Fig. 2) are introduced. Femtosecond laser pulse pumping ferroelectric crystals such as lithium niobate (LN) is one of the most popular methods of the excitation of stimulated phonon polaritons. Tilted pulse fronts and lateral excitation can meet the velocity matching conditions, improve the excitation efficiency of the excited stimulated phonon polaritons, and modify their center frequency and pulse width. Then, the detection of stimulated phonon polaritons is described. Spatiotemporal super resolution quantitative imaging system (Fig. 3) can obtain the complete spatiotemporal evolution process of stimulated phonon polaritons by using pump-probe and phase contrast technique.Thirdly, THz waves transmission modulation based on stimulated phonon polaritons is mainly achieved by three methods: topological valley transport (Fig. 4), asymmetric transmission (Fig. 6), and frozen -phase propagation (Fig. 8). In the topologically protected state, THz waves exhibit valley Hall effect and make smooth detours when encountered with wide angle (120(degrees)) bends, while the trivial ones are majorly scattered. In the subwavelength waveguide with phase gradient metasurfaces, THz waves are capable of asymmetric propagation with bandwidth up to 100 GHz by mode conversion. Under lateral excitation, the first order dispersion ofTHz waves is eliminated, resulting in a phase -invariant propagation. These results lay the foundation for on -chip directional transmission, mode conversion and phase control of THz waves on chip, promoting the practical development of THz integrated devices.Fourthly, in the ionic crystal, the delocalized stimulated phonon polaritons would lead to a giant enhancement of the optical nonlinearity at THz frequency by increasing the ionic polarization. Different from the heat -excited spontaneous phonon polaritons, the specialty of the stimulated phonon polaritons lies in the attendance of external coherent THz driving and the strong delocalization, which breaks the traditional light -matter interaction mechanism. Once THz waves are employed in the polar material, stimulated phonon polaritons are generated (Fig. 10). They transport the ionic states by electromagnetic fields in the whole material, indicating a strong delocalization of the stimulated phonon polaritons and ionic states. Furthermore, the external driving field makes the noncoherent ionic oscillations in spontaneous phonon polaritons become coherent, which is guaranteed to confirm the external driving THz field and behaves in a regular temporal phase evolution. Moreover, the spatial coherence of the stimulated phonon polaritons is protected by the temporal coherence and strong delocalization. Therefore, THz waves can directly excite the ionic polarization via stimulated phonon polaritons-mediated light -matter interaction. This results in a significant nonlinear light -matter interaction and induces a series of phenomena at the THz frequencies. Such high nonlinearities may prove valuable in practical applications such as on -chip integration of THz waves.Conclusions and Prospects Stimulated phonon polaritons in ionic crystals represent not only a continuation of elementary excitations in condensed matter physics, but also a crucial branch in the future development of THz nonlinear physics. Stimulated phonon polaritons exceed Born -Oppenheimer approximation in physics, enabling a novel mechanism of interaction between light and matter. This mechanism turns phonon polaritons, originally affecting material spectra and heat capacity, into active participants in the interaction between light and matter. Through synergizing with strong -field THz radiation, stimulated phonon polaritons can modify the light -matter interaction process, enhancing nonlinear susceptibility and potentially further boosting THz nonlinear effects. Moreover, nonlinear Huang equations suggest that stimulated phonon polaritons can achieve comprehensive control over materials, extending beyond the modulation of optical properties in the high -frequency range (visible and near -infrared) of crystalline materials. This control encompasses properties such as optical -thermal, opto-mechanical, energy levels, and polarization, thus promising significant advancements and breakthroughs in the development of strong -field THz science and technology in the future.

ABSTRACT: "Visualization of ex vivo human patellar cartilage matrix through the phase contrast imaging X-ray computed tomography (PCI-CT) has been previously demonstrated. Such studies revealed osteoarthritis-induced changes to chondrocyte organization in the radial zone. This study investigates the application of texture analysis to characterizing such chondrocyte patterns in the presence and absence of osteoarthritic damage. Texture features derived from Minkowski functionals (MF) and gray-level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM) were extracted from 842 regions of interest (ROI) annotated on PCI-CT images of ex vivo human patellar cartilage specimens. These texture features were subsequently used in a machine learning task with support vector regression to classify ROIs as healthy or osteoarthritic  classification performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The best classification performance was observed with the MF features perimeter (AUC: 0.94 +/- 0.08) and Euler characteristic (AUC: 0.94 +/- 0.07), and GLCM-derived feature Correlation (AUC: 0.93 +/- 0.07). These results suggest that such texture features can provide a detailed characterization of the chondrocyte organization in the cartilage matrix, enabling classification of cartilage as healthy or osteoarthritic with high accuracy."

ABSTRACT: "In this study, the mechanical properties of grain boundaries (GBs) in planar heterostructures of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) were studied using the molecular dynamics method in combination with the density functional theory and classical disclination theory. The hybrid interface between graphene and h-BN grains was optimally matched by a non-bisector GB composed of pentagon-heptagon defects arranged in a periodic manner. GB was found to be a vulnerable spot to initiate failure under uniaxial tension  moreover, the tensile strength was found to anomalously increase with an increase in the mismatch angle between graphene and h-BN grains, i.e., the density of pentagon-heptagon defects along the GBs. The disclination theory was successfully adopted to predict the stress field caused by lattice mismatch at the GB. Comparison between stress contours of GBs with different mismatch angles demonstrates that the arrangement of 5-7 disclinations along the GB is crucial to the strength, and the stress concentration at the GB decreases with an increase in disclination density  this results in an anomalous increase of strength with an increase in the mismatch angle of grains. Moreover, the thermal transfer efficiency of the hybrid GB was revealed to be dependent not only on the mismatch angle of grains but also on the direction of the thermal flux. Thermal transfer efficiency from graphene to h-BN is higher than that from h-BN to graphene. Detailed analyses for the phonon density of states (PDOS) of GB atoms were carried out for the mismatch angle-dependence of interfacial conductance. Our results provide useful insights for the application of two-dimensional polycrystalline heterostructures in next-generation electronic nanodevices."

ABSTRACT: Bismuth nanosheets (Bi-NSs) were successfully prepared and employed as saturable absorbers to generate a diode-pumped dual-wavelength Er3+ : SrF2 laser in the mid-infrared region. Q-switched pulses with a maximum output power of 0.226 W were obtained at an absorbed pump power of 1.97 W. A repetition rate of 56.20 kHz and a minimum pulse duration of 980 ns were achieved. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first application of Bi-NSs in a mid-infrared all-solid-state laser. The results prove that Bi-NSs may be applied as an optical modulator in mid-infrared photonic devices or as a mode-locker and Q-switcher. (C) 2018 Chinese Laser Press.

ABSTRACT: The optical properties of nanogap plasmonic cavities formed by a NanoParticle-on-Mirror (NPoM, or patch antenna) are determined here, across a wide range of geometric parameters including the nanoparticle diameter, gap refractive index, gap thickness, facet size and shape. Full understanding of the confined optical modes allows these nanocavities to be utilized in a wide range of experiments across many fields. We show that the gap thickness t and refractive index n are spectroscopically indistinguishable, accounted for by a single gap parameter G = n/t(0.47). Simple tuning of mode resonant frequencies and strength is found for each quasi-normal mode, revealing a spectroscopic fingerprint  for each facet shape, on both truncated spherical and rhombicuboctahedral nanoparticles. This is applied to determine the most likely nanoscale morphology of facets hidden below each NPoM in experiment, as well as to optimize the constructs for different applications. Simple scaling relations are demonstrated, and an online tool for general use is provided.

ABSTRACT: In this study, we observe the nonlinear behavior of the two-photon geometric phase for polarization states using time-correlated photon pairs. This phase manifests as a shift of two-photon interference fringes. Under certain arrangements, the geometric phase can vary nonlinearly and become very sensitive to a change in the polarization state. Moreover, it is known that the geometric phase for N identically polarized photons is N times larger than that for one photon. Thus, the geometric phase for two photons can become two times more sensitive to a state change. This high sensitivity to a change in the polarization can be exploited for precision measurement of small polarization variation. We evaluate the signal-to-noise ratio of the measurement scheme using the nonlinear behavior of the geometric phase under technical noise and highlight the practical advantages of this scheme.

ABSTRACT: Two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as attractive mediums for fabricating versatile optoelectronic devices. Recently, few-layer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), as a shining 2D material, has been discovered to possess both the saturable absorption effect and large nonlinear refractive index. Herein, taking advantage of the unique nonlinear optical properties of MoS2, we fabricated a highly nonlinear saturable absorption photonic device by depositing the few-layer MoS2 onto the microfiber. With the proposed MoS2 photonic device, apart from the conventional soliton patterns, the mode-locked pulses could be shaped into some new soliton patterns, namely, multiple soliton molecules, localized chaotic multipulses, and double-scale soliton clusters. Our findings indicate that the few-layer MoS2-deposited microfiber could operate as a promising highlynonlinear photonic device for the related nonlinear optics applications.

ABSTRACT: In this letter, a Q-switched linear-cavity Er-doped fiber laser was prepared using a reflective molybdenum disulfide saturable absorber mirror (MoS2-SAM). MoS2-SAM with high uniformity and compactness was prepared using Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technology. Films as thin as single molecule can be fabricated by LB technology under suitable conditions and thus, the nonsaturable losses of absorbers can be decreased. The modulation depth of MoS2-SAM is 9.8%. By inserting MoS2-SAM in Er-doped fiber lasers, a stable passive Q-switched operation was achieved with repetition rate ranging from 46.21 to 215.45 kHz and pulse duration ranging from 1316 to 319 ns. Under a maximum pump power of 500 mW, the laser still works stably with an average output power of 7.37 mW and a signal-to-noise ratio of 58 dB. Notably, the minimum pulse width is as narrow as 319 ns. This shows that LB method is a practical method to improve the performance of saturable absorbers.

ABSTRACT: Photonic crystal (PhC) can be accurately designed to generate nontrivial and trivial modes, that is, edge states (ES)/corner states (CS) and cavity modes, respectively. The coupled cavity-waveguide system designed by PhC provides a chip-scale platform to manipulate electromagnetic (EM) waves that is usually based on near-field coupling between nontrivial and trivial modes. However, the far-field interaction between nontrivial and trivial modes for manipulating EM waves has not attracted wide attention yet. Herein this article, the coupled cavity-waveguide systems, which consist of two separated CS cavities (interacting with single/multiple trivial cavity/cavities) coupled by means of an ES waveguide, are designed to robustly tune the transmission properties of EM waves by modulating the phase coupling between CS cavities. As proof-of-principle examples, single-, dual-, and triple-electromagnetically-induced-transparency-like (EIT-like) phenomena with tunable transmission spectra are theoretically and numerically demonstrated by controlling the distance (generated phase accumulation) between the CS cavities. In addition, the robustness in generating EIT-like transmission characteristics is also demonstrated due to the robustness of the CS cavities. The unique cavity-waveguide systems with unprecedented capability in robustly tuning the transmission spectra of EM waves can be extended to design other high-performance devices with potential applications in sensing, detecting, and information processing.

ABSTRACT: We investigate the fractional Schrodinger equation with a periodic PT-symmetric potential. In the inverse space, the problem transfers into a first-order nonlocal frequency-delay partial differential equation. We show that at a critical point, the band structure becomes linear and symmetric in the one-dimensional case, which results in a nondiffracting propagation and conical diffraction of input beams. If only one channel in the periodic potential is excited, adjacent channels become uniformly excited along the propagation direction, which can be used to generate laser beams of high power and narrow width. In the two-dimensional case, there appears conical diffraction that depends on the competition between the fractional Laplacian operator and the PT-symmetric potential. This investigation may find applications in novel on-chip optical devices.

ABSTRACT: Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) present extraordinary nonlinearities and direct bandgaps at the K and K' valleys. These valleys can be optically manipulated through, for example, plasmon-valley-exciton coupling with spin-dependent photoluminescence. However, the weak coherence between the pumping and emission makes exploring nonlinear valleytronic devices based on TMDCs challenging. Here, we show that a synthetic metasurface, which entangles the phase and spin of light, can simultaneously enhance and manipulate nonlinear valley-locked chiral emission in monolayer tungsten disulfide (WS2) at room temperature. The second-harmonic valley photons, accessed and coherently pumped by light, with a spin-related geometric phase imparted by a gold (Au) metasurface, are separated and routed to predetermined directions in free space. In addition, the nonlinear photons with the same spin as the incident light are steered owing to the critical spin-valley-locked nonlinear selection rule of WS2 in our designed metasurface. Our synthetic TMDC-metasurface interface may facilitate advanced room-temperature and free-space nonlinear, quantum and valleytronic nanodevices.

ABSTRACT: We report on the passive-mode-locking operation of a fiber laser with a fundamental repetition rate of 463MHz based on molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) saturable absorber (SA). By embedding MoS2 into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) thin film, MoS2-PVA SA was prepared with a modulation depth of 2.7% and a saturation intensity of 137 MW/cm(2). The mode-locked fiber laser-employed MoS2-PVA SA was achieved with center wavelength of 1556.3 nm, 3-dB bandwidth of 6.1 nm, output power of 5.9 mW, and an extinction ratio of up to 97 dB in the RF spectrum. The demonstration of mode-locking operation with high fundamental repetition rate and high spectral purity indicates that MoS2-PVA SA can be a good candidate for high-precision ultrafast applications.

ABSTRACT: We propose a standard time-of-flight experiment as a method for observing the anyonic statistics of quasiholes in a fractional quantum Hall state of ultracold atoms. The quasihole states can be stably prepared by pinning the quasiholes with localized potentials and a measurement of the mean square radius of the freely expanding cloud, which is related to the average total angular momentum of the initial state, offers direct signatures of the statistical phase. Our proposed method is validated by Monte Carlo calculations for nu = 1/2 and 1/3 fractional quantum Hall liquids containing a realistic number of particles. Extensions to quantum Hall liquids of light and to non-Abelian anyons are briefly discussed.

ABSTRACT: Optical vortex beams (VB) have provided a new degree of freedom for carrying optical information due to the unbounded number of orthogonal orbital angular momentum (OAM) channels. Due to the presence of phase singularity, VBs possess a dark zone in the center surrounded by a bright ring whose radius is directly related to the OAM carried by the beam. Here multiplexed generalized vortex beams (GVB) are demonstrated with various custom-defined closed-loop beam profiles, including polygons, star and windmill, by tailoring the local phase gradient along the azimuthal direction. By utilizing different polarization channels of metasurfaces, multiple GVBs with independent intensity profiles are generated. This approach provides a playground for realizing various optical modulating capabilities, such as precise particle manipulation, optical source, and OAM encryption.

ABSTRACT: "Engineered photonic waveguides have provided in the past decade an extremely rich laboratory tool to visualize with optical waves the classic analogues of a wide variety of coherent quantum phenomena encountered in atomic, molecular or condensed-matter physics. As compared to quantum systems, optics offers the rather unique advantage of a direct mapping of the wave function evolution in coordinate space by simple fluorescence imaging or scanning tunneling optical microscopy techniques. In this contribution recent theoretical and experimental advances in the field of quantum-optical analogies are reviewed. Special attention is devoted to some relevant optical analogies based oil the use of curved photonic structures, including: coherent destruction of tunneling in driven bistable potentials  coherent population transfer and adiabatic passage in laser-driven multilevel atomic systems quantum decay control and Zeno dynamics  electronic Bloch oscillations and Zener tunneling, Anderson localization and dynamic localization in crystalline potentials.

ABSTRACT: We investigate the timing phase noise of fiber lasers mode locked by graphene oxide (GO) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs), respectively, integrated in a linear cavity fiber laser in the reflecting operation. Due to the shorter decay time of the GO and CNTs, weaker slow saturable absorber effects are expected and mode-locked lasers based on these two saturable absorbers exhibit low excess timing phase noise coupled from the laser intensity noise. Compared with a reference laser mode locked by semiconductor saturable absorber mirror (SESAM), GO based laser obtains a timing phase noise reduction of 7 dB at 1 kHz and a timing jitter reduction of 45% experimentally whereas CNTs based laser obtains a timing phase noise reduction of 3 dB and a timing jitter reduction of 29%. This finding suggests that saturable absorbers with short decay time have the potential for achieving mode locking operation with low timing phase noise, which is important for applications including frequency metrology, high-precision optical sampling, clock distribution and optical sensing.

ABSTRACT: We experimentally demonstrate a passive, stable and low cost Q-switched erbium-doped fiber laser based on molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and black phosphorus (BP) saturable absorber (SA). Both MoS2 and BP SAs are prepared by mechanically exfoliating the crystal and fixing the acquired flakes onto the end surface of a standard FC/PC fiber connector. By integrating either MoS2 or BP SA into the laser cavity, a stable Q-switched operation is achieved at wavelengths of 1551.4 or 1552.9 nm respectively. Using the MoS2 SA, the repetition rate of the output laser increases from 14.25 to 38.43 kHz as the 980 nm pump power rises from 57 to 170 mW while its pulse width reduces from 10.7 to 5.02 mu s. The maximum pulse energy was 141.3 nJ. On the other hand, with the BP SA, the repetition rate and pulse width fall in the ranges of 9.1-44.33 kHz and 20.75-7.04 mu s respectively, as the pump power grows from 50 to 170 mW. The laser with the BP SA, produces the maximum pulse energy of 134 nJ. The experimental results indicate that MoS2 and BP SAs can be used to generate stable Q-switching pulses at 1.5 mu m region successfully.

ABSTRACT: Vortex laser beams carrying an orbital angular momentum (OAM) are increasingly being used for compression of information transfer channels. As a rule, separate beams with an integer OAM are used. We consider vortex beams representing a superposition of the Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) modes with a fractional OAM. Such beams enhance the capabilities and improve the security of information transfer. The propagation of multimode LG beams in a random medium is numerically modelling and the conservation of the OAM is analysed.

ABSTRACT: The magnetic phases of cubic chiral ferromagnets with the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (MnSi, Cu2OSeO3) are studied in terms of microscopic and phenomenological approaches. The interaction of the magnetic moments of atoms with a local crystal field is shown to cause a cubic anisotropic term M-x(4) + M-y(4) + M-z(4) (M is the magnetization field) in the Landau-Lifshitz energy. This term is responsible for the existence of the helical phase at a near-zero magnetic field and can contribute to the stability of the magnetic A phase in higher fields. The A phase is simulated at various magnetic fields. When a magnetic field is turned on, the helices in the helical phase are shown to acquire elliptical and conical components.

ABSTRACT: We report on the optical saturable absorption of few-layer black phosphorus nanoflakes and demonstrate its application for the generation of vector solitons in an erbium-doped fiber laser. By incorporating the black phosphorus nanoflakes-based saturable absorber (SA) into an all-fiber erbium-doped fiber laser cavity, we are able to obtain passive mode-locking operation with soliton pulses down to similar to 670 fs. The properties and dynamics of the as-generated vector solitons are experimentally investigated. Our results show that BP nanoflakes could be developed as an effective SA for ultrashort pulse fiber lasers, particularly for the generation of vector soliton pulses in fiber lasers.

ABSTRACT: All solid-state pulsed lasers (ASSPLs) play a significant role in the fields of medical, military, industry, and scientific research. Passive Q-switching and mode-locking are two of the most effective techniques for generating ASSPLs, in which a saturable absorber (SA) is the key element that has great impact on laser output parameters. Recently, 2D layered materials have been widely studied due to their intriguing properties. Their advantages of ultrafast dynamic processing, excellent nonlinear optical response, broadband operation, and easy fabrication and integration with lasers, enable them to be excellent SAs. Herein, the recent progress of ASSPLs with 2D layered material-based SAs is reviewed, including a brief introduction of the fundamental characteristics, fabrication methods, characterization techniques of ultrafast dynamics, and nonlinear optical properties of 2D materials, design criteria of passively Q-switched and mode-locked bulk lasers, and their applications in ASSPLs. Finally, the potential developments and perspectives on 2D material-based ASSPLs are also highlighted.

ABSTRACT: Significance Semiconductor microelectronics, which are based on the charge properties of electrons, have brought about revolutionary advancements to modern information technology. However, necessary improvements in the computing and information-processing capabilities of devices cannot only be achieved by manipulating and optimizing the charge properties of electrons. The manipulation of electronic spins, one of the most basic characteristics of magnetic materials, has enabled magnetic devices to become considerably successful, resulting in a series of cutting-edge applications with the advantages of nonvolatility and low-calorie requirements. Antiferromagnets, magnetic materials with the internal magnetic moment offset to zero, exhibit fascinating physical properties and have high application potential. First, the spin precession frequency resonant at the terahertz band of antiferromagnets has a higher spin storage density than that of ferromagnets. Second, the stray field of antiferromagnets is almost zero, which provides a strong ability to resist external interference. Third, antiferromagnets are often accompanied by many complex electronic states that give rise to some novel effects. However, owing to the characteristics of weak or zero net magnetic moments, the detection and regulation of antiferromagnetic materials have been challenging for a long time. In recent years, ultrathin and monolayer-exfoliated two-dimensional materials have provided new opportunities for research on antiferromagnets. The low-dimensional scale has improved the interaction among the lattice, electronic spin, and charge, which not only gives rise to complex and rich magnetic states but also paves the way for exploring lowdimensional magnetism and its applications by using interdisciplinary research fields such as optoelectronics. Research based on optical means has many advantages such as enabling microscopic- level, high-speed, noncontact, high-sensitivity analyses with a high space- time and high-energy resolution. In addition, it is conducive to the observation of various magnetic responses of antiferromagnets under extreme physical conditions. The developments of magneto- optical principles and optical detection technology have resulted in the use of various laser spectrum and polarization detection schemes to solve the challenges presented by antiferromagnetic material research. Therefore, it is necessary to summarize research advances on two- dimensional antiferromagnets in the existing magneto-optical field. Progress This paper reviews the progress in the field of magneto-optical research pertaining to antiferromagnets from the perspectives of optical characterization and regulation. After introduction of the basic principles, the main research objects of the interactions between laser and two- dimensional antiferromagnets are extended to the forms of the macroscopic magneto-optical effect and microscopic elementary excitation quasiparticle, respectively. After a brief introduction in Section 1, the basic structure, properties, and classification of typical van der Waals antiferromagnets, including chromium trihalide and transition metal phosphorus sulfide ( Fig. 2), are introduced in Section 2, along with some other common materials (Table 1). Starting from different magnetic coupling characteristics (interlayer or intralayer antiferromagnetic coupling), the magnetic ordering of these antiferromagnetic materials in combination with the molecular configuration and chemical composition are reviewed. In Section 3, multiple magneto-optical effects are discussed for magnetic thin films (Fig. 3). In addition to the wellknown Faraday effect, magneto-optical Kerr effect, Zeeman effect, magnetic dichroism, and Viogt and Cotton- Mouton effects, various specific magnetic changes in matters resulting from the interactions between light and matters are also included. For example, two-dimensional FePS3 exhibits giant linear dichroism because the destruction of the rotational symmetry by the antiferromagnetic order renders the electron energy band anisotropic (Fig. 4). The spin photovoltaic effect is demonstrated in multilayer CrI3, the interlayer magnetic order directly affects the magnitudes of the photocurrent and tunneling current in the direction vertical to the heterojunction. The circular polarization of the photocurrent also reveals a correlation between the magnetic state and the photon energy ( Fig. 5). In terms of spectral detection, the secondharmonic emission and scattering spectra that are closely related to the magnetic order are also reviewed (Fig. 6). Subsequently, the ability of the magneto-optical effect to clearly reflect the regulation of two- dimensional antiferromagnets by means of magnetic field, electric field, temperature field, stress regulation ( Fig. 7), passive regulation, and ultrafast lasers is discussed ( Fig. 8). In the spectral research presented in Section 4, as a link between macro- and micro-quantum phenomena, elementary excitation quasiparticles are shown to greatly facilitate related research on low-dimensional condensed matter physics. Under antiferromagnetic conditions, the disturbance of the magnetic order may affect the properties and mutual coupling of various quasiparticles in the material. The magnons produced by the collective excitation of the laser to the spintronic system facilitate the loading of electrical information, and their frequency determines the switching speed of the spintronic devices. For applications, the energy of the magnons can be adjusted using an all-optical method and an electrostatic doping method controlled by the gate voltage (Fig. 9). On the other hand, research on the transport of magnons in twodimensional antiferromagnetic materials has also been conducted and these transport phenomena could potentially be studied by all-optical imaging. Research on the same Bosonic excitons in two- dimensional antiferromagnets is another important research topic. The Frenkel- like excitons in CrI3 have circular-polarized and polaronic characteristics (Fig. 10), while the Wannier-like excitons in NiPS3 prefer linear polarization and high coherence in the emission spectra ( Fig. 11). For another low-energy excited Bosonic phonon, strong coupling magnon-phonon states are formed through the tuning effect of a large magnetic field ( Fig. 12). The dispersive anti- cross feature of this polaron state is clearly reflected in the spectra, which can provide a new research platform for the magneto- optical control of antiferromagnetic materials. Section 5 summarizes the prospects for further research and the application of two-dimensional antiferromagnets in magneto-optical and related fields. Conclusions and Prospects Compared with ferromagnets, the unique advantages of antiferromagnets in magnetooptical research are undoubtedly expected to accelerate research in spintronics-related fields. Research on antiferromagnets based on the magneto-optical effect is foreseen to focus on more complex and extreme systems in non- collinear, helical, topological, multiferroic, spin-liquid magnetic states, etc. The control of these magnetic states would enable interlayer electronic coupling to be effectively adjusted to facilitate the detection, manipulation, emission, and tracking of spin information through optical means. This approach could introduce huge optical nonlinearity, efficient spin filtering, high conversion efficiency between charge current and spin current, high electron mobility, long spin diffusion length, and other characteristics, and expand the research scope of magnetism, photonics, and other interdisciplinary disciplines. Although the ability to conduct antiferromagnetic writing and reading under two-dimensional conditions would also need to be fundamentally improved, future breakthroughs in two- dimensional antiferromagnetic opto- spintronics can certainly be anticipated.

ABSTRACT: In this paper, we demonstrate a high-damage-resistant tungsten disulfide saturable absorber mirror (WS2-SAM) fabricated by magnetron sputtering technique. The WS2-SAM has an all-fiber-integrated configuration and high-damage-resistant merit because the WS2 layer is protected by gold film so as to avoid being oxidized and destroyed at high pump power. Employing the WS2-SAM in an Erbium-doped fiber laser (EDFL) with linear cavity, the stable Q-switching operation is achieved at central wavelength of 1560 nm, with the repetition rates ranging from 29.5 kHz to 367.8 kHz and the pulse duration ranging from 1.269 mu s to 154.9 ns. For the condition of the maximum pump power of 600 mW, the WS2-SAM still works stably with an output power of 25.2 mW, pulse energy of 68.5 nJ, and signal-noise-ratio of 42 dB. The proposed WS2-SAM configuration provides a promising solution for advanced pulsed fiber lasers with the characteristics of high damage resistance, high output energy, and wide tunable frequency.

ABSTRACT: In this letter, molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe2), a new member of the transition metal dichalcogenides family, has been characterized and fabricated as an optical modulator for the development of broadband wavelength tunable laser using a Tm3+-doped CaYAlO4 crystal as a laser gain medium. The maximum average output power reaches 0.75 W with the shortest pulse width of about 0.69 mu s and repetition rate of 70.9 kHz, which leads to a pulse energy of about 10.58 mu J and peak power of 15.3 W. Keeping the MoTe2 optical modulator inside the laser resonator and at the same time introducing an undoped YAG for wavelength tuning, wavelength tunable passively Q-switched laser operation with a wavelength range of about 112 nm has been demonstrated. This letter experimentally verifies the potential of the novel 2D material MoTe2 as an optical modulator. At the same time, this letter paves the way toward the realizations of simple and compact wavelength tunable pulsed laser sources based on broadband 2D materials saturable absorbers.

ABSTRACT: We report an all-fiber, all-polarization maintaining (PM) ultrafast Tm-doped fiber laser mode-locked by a multilayer graphene-based saturable absorber (SA). The laser emits 603 fs-short pulses centered at 1876 nm wavelength with 6.6 nm of bandwidth and 41 MHz repetition rate. Graphene used as saturable absorber was obtained via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on copper substrate and immersed in a poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) support, forming a stable, free-standing foil containing 12 graphene layers, suitable for the use in a fiber laser. The generated 603 fs pulses are the shortest reported pulses achieved from a Tm-doped laser mode-locked by graphene saturable absorber so far. Additionally, this is the first demonstration of an all-PM Tm-doped fiber laser incorporating a graphene-based SA. Such cost-effective, compact and stable fiber lasers might be considered as sources usable in nonlinear frequency conversion, mid-infrared spectroscopy and remote sensing.

ABSTRACT: We demonstrated a mode-locked thulium/holmium (Tm/Ho) fiber laser continuously tunable across 200 nm (from 1860 nm to 2060 nm), which to the best of our knowledge represents the widest tuning range ever achieved for a passively mode-locked fiber laser oscillator. The combined use of a broadband carbon nanotube (CNT) saturable absorber and a diffraction grating mirror ensures ultra-broad tuning range, superb stability and repeatability, and makes the demonstrated laser a highly practical source for spectroscopy, imaging and optical communications. The laser emits <5 ps pulses with an optical spectral bandwidth of similar to 3 nm across the full tuning range. Our results indicate that carbon nanotubes can be an excellent saturable absorber for achieving gain-bandwidth-limited tunable operation for 2 mu m thulium fiber lasers.

ABSTRACT: We demonstrated a pulsed erbium-doped fiber laser (EDFL) based on a few-layer molybdenum disulfide saturable absorber (MoS2-SA). The MoS2-SA was fabricated into a film structure by evaporating the mixture of MoS2 nanosheets and polyvinyl alcohol. The Raman spectra and nonlinear optical characteristics were measured to confirm the quality of the as-prepared MoS2-SA. By inserting the MoS2-SA into an EDFL, the pulsed operation from the stable Q-switched to mode-locking regime could be achieved by simply increasing the pump power level. The Q-switched pulse duration and repetition rate could vary from 5.18 to 3.53 mu s and from 72.74 to 86.39 kHz, respectively. The maximum pulse energy was 74.93 nJ. After the achievement of Q-switched operation, the ultrashort mode-locking pulse was obtained by further increasing the pump power. The results further demonstrate the excellent saturable absorption ability of the few-layer MoS2 at telecommunication waveband. (C) 2016 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

ABSTRACT: With the development of all-optical networks, all-optical devices have become a research hotspot in recent years. Two-dimensional materials, represented by graphene and black phosphorus, have attracted great interest in the scientific community due to their excellent optical, electrical, magnetic, and mechanical properties. Bridging the gap between fiber optics and nanotechnology, microfibers can interact with light and matter at the micro or even nanoscale. By combining two-dimensional materials with microfibers, composite waveguides can be formed.

In this review, the properties of typical 2D materials are first introduced. Next, the preparation methods of the relevant equipments are introduced and compared. Then, the all-optical signal processing technology based on 2D material-integrated microfiber composite waveguide is reviewed. The latest developments of all-optical modulators, all-optical wavelength converters, all-optical logic gates and all-optical thresholding devices are presented.

ABSTRACT: Embedding 2D layered materials into polymers and other materials as composites has resulted in the development of ultrasensitive pressure sensors, tunable conductive stretchable polymers, and thermoelectric coatings. As a wettable paint or ink, many 2D materials may be penciled, printed, or coated onto a range of surfaces for a variety of applications. However, the intrinsic conductive properties of painted coatings using 2D and layered materials are not completely understood, and conductive polymer additives may mask underlying properties such as directional conductivity. We report a process for making a paint from solvent-exfoliated Bi2Te3 into solution-dispersible 2D and few layer (multiple quintuple) nanosheet inks, that form smooth, uniform paint blends at several concentrations of Bi2Te3. The individual solvent-exfoliated nanosheets are edge-coated by (poly) ethylene glycol to produce a paint, stable over extended period in solution. Electrical transport is found to be sensitive to aspect ratio, and conduction along the painting direction is suppressed for longer strips so long as the aspect ratio is high (4-10X or more), but for short and wide paint strips (aspect ratio <= 1), conductance is improved by a factor of 3X. Square 2D paint regions show no clear directional preference for conductance at room temperature but are markedly affected by higher temperatures. Conductivity along a preferential conduction pathway through the nanosheet ensemble is modulated by 2D nanosheet stacking along the direction of paint application for a given aspect ratio. This paint and insights into geometrical 2D composite conduction may have implications for conductive composites, thermoelectrics, and writable circuits using 2D material paints or inks.

ABSTRACT: Using a series of different concentration polymer-free graphene oxide (GO) films as saturable absorbers (SAs), we demonstrate high-power passively continuous-wave modelocking (CW-ML) and Q-switching mode-locking (QS-ML) for a Nd: LuVO4 laser at 1 mu m. CW-ML pulses of 6.62 ps with maximum output power of 3.89 W have been achieved to give the highest pulse peak power of 4.85 kW and pulse energy of 32.14 nJ under 15-W pumping by using SAs of 84.4% transmittance. Using SAs with a lower transmittance having a larger modulation depth of 75.9% and 63.4%, we obtain both the CW-ML pulses of 4.85-ps and QSML pulses with 2.73 W and 1.92 W output powers, respectively.

ABSTRACT: We have investigated the broadband saturable absorption property of graphene-Bi2Te3 heterostructures and demonstrated their applications for stable harmonic mode-locking operation in a Yb-doped fiber laser and wavelength-tunable Q-switching operation in an Er-doped fiber laser. The modulation depth of a graphene-Bi2Te3 heterostructure saturable absorber (G-Bi2Te3-SA) is dependent on the coverage of Bi2Te3 on the graphene. By using 15%-Bi2Te3-covered G-Bi2Te3-SA with a modulation depth of 23.28% and saturable intensity of 3.32 MW/cm(2), the harmonic mode-locked Yb-doped fiber laser outputs the mode-locked pulses with a pulse duration down to 189.94 ps, spectral bandwidth of 3.5 nm, and repetition rate of 79.13 MHz (21st order of the fundamental frequency). After inserting the G-Bi2Te3-SA with 85% coverage of Bi2Te3 on graphene into Er-doped fiber laser cavity, whose modulation depth and saturable intensity are about 40.79% and 12.48 MW/cm(2), respectively, the wavelength-tunable Q-switched pulse with tunable wavelength range over 13.2 nm has been obtained by adjusting the intracavity fiber filter. These results suggest that the graphene- Bi2Te3 heterostructure could serve as a high nonlinear photonic device for practical applications.

ABSTRACT: Molecular self-assembly, a part of bottom-up self-assembly approach, inspires the construction of challenging molecular topologies. Advances in attosecond sciences lead a wealth of important discoveries in biochemical molecular ultrafast dynamic processes relevant to a single atomic, molecular etc. quantum state toward the generation and application of extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) sub-femtosecond approaches, which offer opportunities to probe challenging molecular topologies. Measurement and control of space-time biophoton-bioelectron coupling dynamic motion in complex biochemical molecular structures-inspired heterosingle quantum state systems are a formidable challenge. Different from infrared van der Waals nanostructures and Borromean rings with three macrocycle interlocked architectures, blue-shift complex structure nanomedicine crystals containing heterosingle molecules, heterosingle atoms, single biophotons, single bioelectrons relied up a directed design according to at least four factor or more factor orthogonal mathematics statistics coupling a bottom-up self-assembly approach wherein inter-molecular self-assembly and intra-molecular self-assembly relied up short range forces like hydrogen bonding, metal coordination, hydrophobic forces, van der Waals forces, pi-pi interaction, electrostatic interaction, folding mechanisms and long range forces like electromagnetic interactions were involved. By application of self-assembled nanomedicine crystals and self-assembled sub-femtosecond EUV laser micro-photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy system with third harmonic generator etc. tools, time-resolution blue-shifted laser micro-PL spectroscopy from the near infrared to the ultraviolet was detected and revealed by a sphere integrator. It is concluded that molecular self-assembly-inspired nanomedicine crystal as a testing model paves a way toward facilitating attosecond nanobiophotonic approaches at the single molecular level that is below the diffraction limit of light, which facilitates state-of-the art transformational and translational technologies.

ABSTRACT: A precision patterning sub-nanometrology in a single quantum state such as a single electron, a single photon, a single atom, a single molecule, etc. leads an international technology roadmap for semiconductors (ITRS) to quantum noise limits, where quantum effects occur in a sub-nanometer (sub-nm) real space with ultra-fast time and frequency resolutions. Classical metrology technologies face challenges, due to failure to achieve such a transient resolution. In response to the cutting-edge issue, a precision patterning sub-nanometrology relied up a pico-meter quantum sensing approach was developed to satisfy a precision sub-nanometrology need, wherein a conducting atomic force microscopy (C-AFM) coupling a laser micro-photoluminescence (micro-PL) spectroscopy was a state-of-the art height-current-phase uncertainty correlation reproducible traceable precision sub-nanometrology technology with a powerful pico-meter (pm) spatial resolution associated with transient quantized pico-ample differential current-nominal voltage resolutions relied up a quantum electrical measurement triangle principle. A self-assembled vertical nanomedicine photoluminescence crystal array with an atomic interference effect was revealed in Figure 1 and a quantum regenerative amplification principle was discussed. It is concluded that a precision patterning sub-nanometrology relied up a pico-meter quantum sensing approach provides a new impetus for an integrated circuit scaling and paves a way towards developing quantum-level self-alignment patterning technologies to support precision quantum sensing and metrological device innovations and beyond, which are important for quality-profit upgrades and global industry developments.
